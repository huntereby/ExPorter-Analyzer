Lafora disease (LD) is a fatal, autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorder that presents as epilepsy in
late childhood or adolescence and is followed rapidly by cognitive deterioration, dementia, and death within 10
years of onset. Currently, there is no treatment and anti-seizure drugs are only beneficial in early stages. LD is
characterized by the intracellular accumulation of glycogen-like aggregates called Lafora bodies (LBs) that
occur in cells from most tissues, thus LD is also a glycogen storage disease (GSD). Although multiple labs are
defining LD cellular and behavioral disease sequela as well as developing therapies, there is currently no
biomarker to assess LD progression and/or treatment efficacy non-invasively. We recently reported a novel
approach for imaging glycogen non-invasively using the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) between aliphatic
and hydroxyl protons in glycogen that can be detected with standard MRI equipment. Using this glycoNOE
approach, we successfully showed that changes in liver glycogen could be measured dynamically with high
temporal and spatial resolution. Importantly, there was a linear correlation between glycoNOE contrast and
glycogen concentration.
The objective of this grant is to establish a quantitative MRI test for reporting LB load and treatment efficacy in
muscle and brain non-invasively. To achieve this, we will utilize LD mice as our model system, and we have
set the following specific aims (1a) Establish a robust glycoNOE MRI protocol for detecting LBs in skeletal
muscle, (1b) Calibrate glycoNOE MRI in muscle as a function of concentration of glycogen, (2a) Develop a
glycoNOE MRI-based quantitative test for reporting LBs in the brain, (2b) Longitudinal study of LD in mice
using glycoNOE, (3a) Utilize glycoNOE MRI to monitor LB levels in LD mice after a therapeutic intervention,
(3b) Assess the re-accumulation of LBs after treatment.
These aims will result a non-invasive method for imaging glycogen changes in the brain and muscle with high
spatial resolution. The methods developed in this proposal will be immediately translatable to standard human
MRI scanners. This technology will be applicable to all glycogen storage diseases, which affect about 1 in
15,000 and thus expand the scope beyond LD. The proposed aims are critical to enable translation of these
results into diagnosing and monitoring of treatments for LD and the broader GSD patient population."

The cumulative rate of repeated trauma exposure is greater in Black communities of urban, low socioeconomic
status and is associated with increased prevalence of adverse, posttraumatic mental health outcomes,
including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is associated with trauma-related hyperarousal (TRH)
and dysregulated fear responses that are dependent upon brain regions that modulate responses to threat,
including the amygdala and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. One biological factor that confers increased
risk for TRH is female sex. While rigorous studies have shown that low levels of the steroid hormone estradiol
(E2) are associated with increased risk for TRH and hyper-sensitivity to threat in trauma-exposed women,
these prior studies compared women who naturally differed from one another in E2 levels regardless of
reproductive status/stage. Thus, further work is needed to determine how changes in E2 over the menopausal
transition increase vulnerability to TRH and hyper-reactivity to threat in trauma-exposed women. The current
study is well positioned to address this gap in knowledge given our recruitment of perimenopausal Black
women from a high trauma risk population. The proposed research will combine clinical interviews, fear
psychophysiology, neuroimaging, and neuroendocrinology to examine how the perimenopause and changes in
E2 levels over time influence TRH and responsivity to threat. Investigating how neuroendocrine changes
during the menopausal transition influence fear psychophysiology and amygdala reactivity to threat to impact
TRH is critical for the identification, assessment, and treatment of these symptoms during the perimenopause
in women, especially Black women, who experience disproportionately higher rates of cumulative trauma
exposure and PTSD."

 process and with prognostic discussions, including the recently developed VOCAL-Penn Cirrhosis Surgical
Score. However, all prediction scores focus heavily on post-operative mortality as an outcome, and all were
with the provider perspective in mind. To date there have been no tudies exploring the perspective and
 of patients with cirrhosis when deciding to pursue or avoid a given surgical procedure. Failure to
and incorporate this perspective into prognostic discussions reflects a paternalistic medical approach
may lead to patient regret, patient dissatisfaction, and reduced post-operative quality of life, among other
outcomes. Through a mixed-methods approach, we hypothesize that identifying and quantifying the
of patient-important surgical outcomes in patients with cirrhosis will lead to a more comprehensive
of the patient perspective that will translate to improved shared decision-making between patients
providers. The primary aims of this proposal are as follows: in Specific Aim 1 , we will perform a qualitative
 of diverse patients with cirrhosis to elicit characteristics and outcomes of surgery that are important in
( attributes ) and explore how changing the levels of these attributes may change willingness to
surgery. This will be applied to a specific, common surgical scenario: an elective abdominal hernia
In Specific Aim 2 , the data from the prior aim will be used to create a discrete choice experimental survey
patients with cirrhosis are asked to evaluate scenarios with mutually exclusive options to proceed with
or non-surgical management for a symptomatic abdominal hernia. By varying levels of attributes, we will

result in a quantitative, hierarchical understanding of attributes that patients consider to be important when

This project will provide data critical to advance our understanding of enzyme sequence/structure/function
relationships. We will develop innovative microfluidic tools and techniques and apply them to systematically
study enzymes at a high-throughput and quantitative level. In the prior granting period, we developed HT-
MEK (High-Throughput Microfluidic Enzyme Kinetics), which enabled recombinant expression, purification,
and deep functional characterization of >1500 enzymes in parallel and returns kinetic and thermodynamic
constants (e.g. kcat/KM, kcat, KM, Ki) at unprecedented scale. Here, we extend this platform to provide a suite
of techniques (HT-MES, High-Throughput Microfluidic Enzyme Stability) capable of quantifying kinetic and
thermodynamic stabilities (e.g. ΔGfold, kunfold) with similar throughput. We will also enable site-specific
incorporation of noncanonical amino acids to provide the capability to isolate and systematically the impact
of particular physicochemical residue properties and to investigate the impacts of post-translational
modifications.
During the prior granting period, our application of HT-MEK to profile multiple substitutions at each position
and multiple functional parameters for the model alkaline phosphatase PafA revealed that residues with
similar functional effects on catalysis formed large and spatially contiguous ‘regions’ that extended from
the active site to distal surfaces, and that different regions affected different aspects of function. Here, we
will systematically apply HT-MEK/S to a variety of new systems to build upon these observations and
develop and test new models of how enzymes attain their functions and their observed kinetic and
thermodynamic constants. Specifically, we will map functional couplings between residues in PafA via
double and multi-mutant cycles and test the degree to which observations from PafA generalize by
applying HT-MEK/S to investigate other alkaline phosphatase superfamily members and to acyl
phosphatases, which provide ideal enzymes for developing and testing predictive computational models.
We will also profile impacts of all nonsynonymous single nucleotide substitutions on folding and catalysis
for protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs), providing clinically-relevant information about potential health
consequences of mutations that can direct development of mechanistically relevant therapies and
therapeutics. Finally, we will extend the reach of HT-MEK/S via collaborative projects with the Keedy and
Zalatan labs. In all cases, we seek to use high-throughput data to test computational predictions, provide
much-needed ground truth data for use by others, and reveal previously unattainable insights into the
functional and energetic inner workings of enzymes."
10811527,"Project Summary/Abstract
Persons with HIV (PWH) remain at an elevated risk of developing cognitive impairments. Such impairments are
the most common neurological complication of HIV disease, and research targeting these comorbidities is one
of four overarching priorities identified by the Office of AIDS Research (NOT-OD-20-018). Recent neuroimaging
studies have broadly shown that the milder impairments more frequently observed in virally suppressed PWH
arise from multiple cortical circuits, which is a major paradigm shift from the putative subcortical origins of the
severe cognitive impairments observed earlier in the epidemic. However, despite this progress, we still have a
limited understanding of the molecular precursors and pathways that lead to dysfunction in these cortical circuits,
and virtually no viable therapeutic options, with only limited potential avenues (e.g., cannabis) on the horizon.
This proposal responds to RFA-DA-24-003, which calls for applications that “identify and characterize common
and specific inflammasome pathways” activated by illicit drugs and HIV, quantify “the impact of inflammasome
activation on cognition and behavior,” evaluate “inflammasome signatures … and their use as biomarkers of
neuroinflammation in PWH and substance use disorders (SUD),” and determine the “structural and functional
consequences of inflammasome activation in different anatomical brain regions under the influence of SUD
and HIV.” The proposed project responds to this call with a large-scale, innovative, dynamic functional mapping
and molecular markers study that leverages multiple recent discoveries to identify the role(s) of inflammasome
activation in the mechanisms and overall pathways underlying HIV-related inflammation and cognitive decline, as
well as the impact of regular cannabis use on these parameters in virally suppressed PWH. Specifically, Aim 1
examines whether the neural oscillations and circuitry serving working memory and attention are modulated by
inflammasome activity and/or the mitochondrial redox environment, which builds on our work featured in PNAS
and Brain, Behavior, and Immunity that the superoxide-sensitive mitochondrial redox environment differentially
predicts cognitive performance and the underlying neural oscillations in controls and PWH. Aim 2 quantifies the
impact of regular cannabis use on inflammasome activity and the mitochondrial redox environment and follows
on the heels of our finding that mitochondrial function differentially modulates superoxide in PWH relative to
controls, and that superoxide predicts neuroinflammatory levels and cognitive function. Finally, Aim 3 builds on
our recent finding that cannabis suppresses the pathological spontaneous cortical activity that is observed in
PWH, and is accentuated in cognitively impaired PWH, by identifying whether these cannabis-induced effects
are mainly driven by normalization of the mitochondrial redox environment, inflammasome activation, or both.
These recent, major scientific advances provide an ideal foundation to directly address the key objectives of this
RFA through an innovative project that uses state-of-the-art neuroimaging and systems biology methods to build
on an established model of neuroinflammation that has been linked to cognitive and neural dysfunction in PWH."
10813028,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a health epidemic that increases risk of death due to various comorbidities.
Alterations in mineral metabolism are a hallmark of advanced CKD, where elevations in serum phosphate
levels (hyperphosphatemia) have been suspected to directly contribute to tissue damage and mortality.
Hyperphosphatemia is clinically tackled in CKD patients by administration of phosphate binders and
introduction of low phosphate diets. While the contributions of hyperphosphatemia to vascular calcification
have been established and the underlying signaling mechanism in vascular smooth muscle cells has been
studied, the potential direct effects of elevated phosphate on other tissues and cell types are not understood. In
our study, we focus on skeletal muscle wasting and atrophy which affects many patients with CKD. In our
preliminary studies, we have characterized the skeletal muscle phenotype in two mouse models of CKD, one
genetic and one diet-induced, and our molecular, histological and functional analyses indicate reduced muscle
strength and mass as well as reduced size of individual myofibers and activation of atrophy gene programs.
Since these mice develop hyperphosphatemia, and our preliminary in vitro studies indicate that phosphate
elevations can induce atrophy in differentiated skeletal muscle cells (myotubes), we hypothesize that in CKD,
elevated serum phosphate levels can directly affect skeletal muscle tissue and contribute to skeletal muscle
wasting. Since phosphate uptake via specific phosphate transporters is essential for all cells and tissues for
house-keeping functions and survival, we cannot use loss-of-function approaches to study the direct effects of
phosphate on skeletal muscle in mice. Instead, we will determine whether administration of a low phosphate
diet, when initiated early on, protects CKD mice from developing skeletal muscle atrophy. Our phenotypic
analyses will include structural and functional studies by MRI and histology, and also focus on fibrosis,
inflammation and increased fat content which are observed in skeletal muscle tissue of CKD patients. Our in
vivo study is accompanied by cell culture experiments which analyze direct effects of phosphate on myotubes.
We will determine the involvement of phosphate transporters and the signaling mechanisms that mediate
phosphate-induced atrophy in cultured myotubes. Our preliminary studies also indicate that healthy mice
receiving a high phosphate diet for three months develop signs of skeletal muscle atrophy. While the injury
seems to be milder than in CKD mice, this finding indicates that hyperphosphatemia by itself, in the absence of
kidney injury, can damage skeletal muscle. We will determine if prolonged administration of a high phosphate
diet further increases skeletal muscle damage, and whether after three months of high phosphate diet the
transition to a diet with normal phosphate content reverses skeletal muscle injury. If successful, our study
would indicate that lowering phosphate in CKD has protective effects on skeletal muscle tissue, and that diets
rich in phosphate salts, such as all processed foods, can cause skeletal muscle injury in healthy individuals."

PROJECT SUMMARY
The Crystallography and Computational Biosciences Shared Resource (CCBSR) is a highly specialized shared
resource that provides Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) members with access
to expertise, consultation, and state-of-the-art equipment for structural biology experiments and computational
bioscience approaches. Under the continued tripartite co-directorship of Thomas Hollis, PhD, W. Todd
Lowther, PhD, and Freddie Salsbury Jr., PhD, CCBSR was rated “Outstanding” in the last Cancer Center
Support Grant renewal. CCBSR functions as a collaborative model, i.e., the Co-Directors guide the development
of projects with WFBCCC members, through the collection of essential preliminary data for NIH/NCI and other
cancer-focused funding applications. As a project matures and secures extramural funding, graduate students,
postdoctoral fellows, and technicians are added to the project. As such, the Co-Directors typically contribute to
all publications as co-authors and participate as PI or Co-I on most grant applications. The scientific importance
of this resource centers on the need to understand the molecular basis for protein-protein, protein-DNA/RNA,
and protein-ligand/drug interactions, and how dynamics affect these interactions. This information is crucial for
the development of novel small molecule drugs and other therapeutic strategies. Over the current funding cycle,
26 projects (22 with a cancer focus) have used the CCBSR. There are 17 active projects underway, representing
investigators fromthe Cancer Genetics and Metabolism(CGM) Program, the Signaling and Biotechnology (SBT)
Program, and the Neuro-Oncology (NRO) Program. In the current funding period, the CCBSR contributed to 39
publications. The data collected by the CCBSR enabled 13 of these projects to receive new funding: 10
extramurally-funded (including NCI, NIGMS, NIAID, NIDA, DOD and NSF), 1 industry sponsored research
agreement (SRA) for a novel redox-based cancer therapy, and 2 awards from the North Carolina Center for
Biotechnology. The Specific Aims of the next funding period are to: (1) determine the appropriate
crystallography and/or computational approach for the investigation of protein structure and dynamics alone and
in complex with important biomolecules for cancer research; (2) conduct initial crystallization trials or simulations
to generate preliminary data for grant applications; and (3) provide facilities and expertise for funded projects to
determine the structure or dynamics of important biomolecules in cancer research. All aims include the training
of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Graduate students participate in multiple NIH-funded T32 training
programs that incorporate training of this SR into their program offerings."

qualitative research and provides expert guidance on patient-reported outcomes (PRO) measurement. Its Co-
Directors are Erin Sutfin, PhD, and Lynne Wagner, PhD, both Professors in the Department of Social Sciences
and Health Policy and members of the WFBCCC Cancer Prevention and Control Program. Q-PROSR was
established in 2016 as a developing shared resource and adds new infrastructure to the institution to support
population and clinical researchthrough the following three Specific Aims: (1) provide operational and analytical
support to all areas of qualitative inquiry, including methodological design, selection and recruitment of study

expanded their scope to include Q-PROSR. In the short period since Q-PROSR’s establishment, it has already
been instrumental to 5 cancer-relevant publications and 8 cancer-relevant manuscripts under review. With the
formative nature of Q-PROSR’s research and the typical lag time fromformative research to publication, a steady
increase in Q-PROSR publications is anticipated. In addition to publications, Q-PROSR’s scientific impact is
evident through collaboration on formative research to refine cancer-relevant interventions evaluated in 2
randomized controlled trials; generationof preliminary data for grant proposals; and collaborations with the Office
of Cancer Health Equity (the supporting unit of the WFBCCC Community Outreach and Engagement efforts) to
prioritize and shape research initiatives aimed at reducing disparities in the WFBCCC catchment area."

10813893,"RNA molecules play fundamental roles in nearly all cellular processes at the level of gene expression and
regulation. Not surprisingly, emerging biomedical advances such as precision medicine and synthetic biology all
point to RNA as the central regulators and information carriers. Recently, realizing the potential of using RNA
to intervene gene expression, scientists successfully developed Onpattro, the ﬁrst FDA-approved RNA-based
therapy in August 2018.
 Understanding RNA function and therapeutic applications requires knowledge about RNA structure. Unfortu-
nately, currently, the number of the known structures is a small fraction of what need to be determined. This gap
has to be closed by computational methods. Furthermore, an RNA molecule is a highly charged polyanion and
positive charges such as metal ions bind to an RNA and for an integral part of an RNA structure. Where and how
metal ions interact with an RNA can directly impact RNA structure and function as well as RNA-drug interactions.
 Continuously supported by NIH for over 15 years, we have developed systematic computational tools for the
predictions of RNA structures, folding stability, kinetics, and metal ion effects. These tools have led to fruitful
applications in virology, microbiology, gene therapy, RNA biotechnology, and various RNA-based therapeutic de-
signs. However, despite over decade of efforts, many critical issues in computational RNA biology still remain:
de novo prediction of non-Watson-Crick interactions, structure prediction for large RNAs, effective incorporation
of experimental data such as cryo-EM and NMR data into structure prediction, and modeling of metal ion ef-
fects. In this grant, after 15 years of developing an initio physics-based models, we propose to target the above
and other pressing issues using a fundamentally different approach by systematically developing data-driven
(such as deep-learning) or hybrid data-driven/physics-based simulation methods. The new approaches are mo-
tivated by the increasing amount of experimental data and the pressing need to have more efﬁcient and reliable
computational tools for data interpretation, especially for structure determination experiments. We will use ex-
perimental database, such as RNA-Puzzles database, PDB, EMDataBank, BMRB, for large-scale benchmark
tests, and biochemical and NMR data collected by our well-established collaborators for in-depth and interactive
information about various experiments such as HCV genomic RNAs and HIV PBS systems. Our goal, if success-
fully accomplished, will immediately impact experiments such as structure determination, including cryo-EM and
NMR-based structure determination, identiﬁcation of metal ion sites, and rational design of RNA structures for
therapeutic applications."
10812778,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an inherited neurological disorder characterized by cerebellar and
retinal degeneration. SCA7 is caused by CAG/polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansions in the ataxin-7 gene.
Over 20 years ago, we linked SCA7 retinal degeneration to transcription dysregulation, and then discovered
that ataxin-7 is a core component of the transcription co-activator complex STAGA, which possesses intrinsic
histone acetyltransferase (GCN5) and histone deubiquitinase (USP22) activity. In the last funding cycle, we
set out to determine the molecular basis of SCA7 cerebellar and retinal degeneration by examining the
transcriptome and epigenome, and thereby implicated DNA damage, metabolic dysregulation, mitochondrial
abnormalities, and calcium dyshomeostasis in SCA7 disease pathogenesis. To obtain a more complete
understanding of the SCA7 disease process in cerebellum and retina, we are now pursing single-cell
transcriptome and epigenome analysis in the highly representative SCA7 266Q knock-in mouse model.
Employing a novel Purkinje cell-enriched single nucleus (sn)RNA-seq method, we discovered altered synaptic
organization and excitatory-inhibitory balance in presymptomatic SCA7 mice. Bioinformatics analysis revealed
dramatic dysregulation of normal aldolase-C / zebrin-II expression patterning and corresponding parasagittal
striping in presymptomatic SCA7 mice, and based upon analysis of related SCA polyQ disease model mice,
we established that altered cerebellar neurodevelopment is a shared disease feature across various polyQ
cerebellar ataxias. Here we propose to define the epigenetic basis for transcriptional alterations in SCA7
retinal degeneration and cerebellar degeneration by performing snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq on retina and
cerebellum samples from SCA7 mice, and classifying DEGs and DARs from different cell types to reveal genes
and regulatory elements that underlie the molecular pathology. We will pursue Transcription Factor Binding
Site analysis to define transcription factors (TFs) whose dysregulation may contribute to SCA7, and we will
confirm candidate TF and epigenetic pathology by directed experimentation. We will modulate the expression
or function of implicated TFs in SCA7 knock-in model mice to determine if such interventions can prevent or
significantly ameliorate SCA7 neurodegeneration. This validation work will employ an in vivo epigenetic rescue
strategy involving use of Cre-inducible dCas9-p300 (or -KRAB) mice, and we will determine if epigenetic
rescue can ameliorate SCA7 retinal and cerebellar pathology, including disrupted zebrin-II patterning. Finally,
we will test if interventions found to rescue SCA7 cerebellar disease can be applied to related polyQ SCAs."
10812779,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The hippocampus is a brain structure that is critical for normal learning and memory functions. One of the
first brain regions to deteriorate in Alzheimer's Disease is the hippocampal memory system, causing the
memory deficits that are among the first cognitive symptoms of the disease. To understand why hippocampal
damage causes such severe memory deficits, it is necessary to understand the basic computational functions
of this brain region. Much research on the hippocampus is derived from the dorsal part of the hippocampus of
rodents, whereas the largest part of the hippocampus in humans (i.e., the anterior hippocampus) corresponds
to the much-less studied ventral hippocampus in rodents. The ventral hippocampus subserves different
behavioral and cognitive functions than the dorsal hippocampus, in large part because the dorsal and ventral
parts of the hippocampus are connected to different brain regions. The specific aims of this project are to test
the hypothesis that that the dorsal, middle, and ventral parts of the hippocampus, although distinct in their
behavioral functions, share a common computational function that is performed on the varying types of input
representations received along this axis. Aim 1 will test the specific hypothesis that the computational gradient
of spatial pattern separation to pattern completion in the dorsal CA3 region is preserved across all levels of the
hippocampal dorsal-ventral axis. To generalize these results to cognitive functions more associated with the
ventral hippocampus, Aim 2 will test the hypotheses that (a) proximal CA3 performs a pattern separation
function on contextual and odor inputs, whereas distal CA3 performs a pattern completion/generalization
function on these inputs, and (b) this gradient is preserved across all levels of the dorsal-ventral axis. Finally, to
understand the nature of the inputs from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus along the dorsal-ventral
axis, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the allocentric spatial properties of the medial entorhinal cortex, and the
egocentric spatial properties of the lateral entorhinal cortex, are differentially controlled by local and global
frames of reference in regions that project to the dorsal hippocampus and the ventral hippocampus,
respectively. The results of these experiments will provide crucial knowledge about how the hippocampus
performs its mnemonic computations that support our abilities to remember the episodic experiences of our
daily lives, including their spatial, social, and emotional contents."

The goal of our research is to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of chronic itch, a disease that
interferes with normal daily activity and can have serious clinical consequences. Many pathological conditions
can lead to chronic itch such as localized skin diseases or more systemic conditions like cholestasis and
kidney failure. Itch can also be a side effect of many therapeutic drugs. Current therapies including
antihistamines are ineffective in most chronic itch conditions suggesting the involvement of histamine
independent pathways. A major hurdle in understanding histamine-independent itch is the lack of knowledge
about the receptors directly activated by non-histaminergic stimuli. Primary sensory neurons in dorsal root
ganglia (DRG) play an essential role in detecting itch. Our lab has identified members of a G protein-coupled
receptor (GPCR) Mrgpr family that are specifically expressed in DRG and function as itch receptors. Recently
we showed that MrgprA1 in mice and its human homologue MRGPRX4 function as novel itch receptors,
detecting bilirubin and bile acids (BAs). More importantly, we demonstrated that MrgprA1/X4 play an essential
role for mediating cholestatic pruritus (itch), a condition resulting in elevated bilirubin and BAs due to bile duct
blockage. Our preliminary data suggest that MrgprA1 are novel receptors for various therapeutic drugs and
mediates drug-induced itch side effect. Preliminary data show that MrgprA1 also contributes to allergic contact
dermatitis (ACD). Furthermore, previous studies and our preliminary data suggest BAs are also mediators for
uremic pruritus. In this proposal, we will take a multidisciplinary approach to test the hypothesis that
MrgprA1/X4 are itch receptors and mediate itch caused by different disease conditions including medication
caused itch side effect, ACD, and kidney disease which dramatically impact the quality of patient's life and the
underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In Aim I, we will test the hypothesis that some of drugs with itch side
effect are pruritogens themselves by directly activating pruriceptive (itch sensing) neurons via MrgprA1 using
mouse genetics, pharmacology, in vitro Ca2+ imaging, electrophysiology, and in vivo DRG imaging. In Aim II,
we will test the hypothesis that MrgprA1 in sensory nerves and its peptide agonist NPFF released from nearby
mast cells in the skin contributes to ACD itch using different ACD mouse models combined with mouse
genetics and pharmacological approaches. In addition, we will determine whether pruriceptive neurons are
activated under ACD conditions and if so whether MrgprA1 and NPFF mediate the activation using in vivo
DRG GCaMP imaging. In Aim III, we will employ two uremic itch mouse models, an adenine-induced or a
uremic itch patient plasma injection model to test the hypothesis that BAs mediate uremic itch by activating
MRGPRX4 expressed in mouse DRG neurons. Moreover, we will identify other itch mediators present in
patient plasma who are receiving hemodialysis due to kidney failure. The results of this project will provide
insight into key itch mechanisms and open the door for the development of novel itch therapeutics."
10812571,"Abstract
Silent synapses are instrumental in experience-dependent cortical network reorganization. This process is
particularly prevalent during developmental critical periods when silent synapses are abundant. Genesis, loss,
and maturation of these silent synapses alters the synaptic connection pattern to establish the fundamental
processing architectures of excitatory neural networks during critical periods. Whether silent synapses mature
or are lost is a critical decision point to determine the fate of synaptic connections between neurons. Thus, the
delicate balance of the pace of silent synapse maturation and their loss determines the outcome of the refinement
process during critical periods. However, the molecular underpinnings regulating the pace of silent synapse
maturation and how changes in pace impact local neural circuits and sensory perception remains elusive. Our
previous studies report that the pace is controlled by the opposing but cooperative function of two postsynaptic
signaling scaffolds, PSD-93 and -95, that inhibits and promotes silent synapse maturation, respectively. Using
unbiased quantitative phosphoproteomic approaches, we identified signaling pathways affected by PSD-93 and
-95 that govern the maturation. The proposed experiments employ genetic manipulations using viral vectors and
transgenic mouse models, combined with electrophysiological analysis, quantitative proteomic analyses, and
confocal imaging to focus on a fundamentally new concept of silent-synapse based mechanism driving
experience-dependent cortical development. Results will reveal a so far unknown signaling mechanism in
regulating the pace of silent synapse maturation. Expected results will advance our understanding of the
molecular mechanisms of neural network refinement, and their impact on local circuits and visual perception,
exemplified in the primary visual cortex, but relevant to cortical networks in general."
10812572,"PROJECT SUMMARY
U.S. women of childbearing age (WOCBA: 18-49 years) have the highest death rates from pregnancy and
cardiometabolic abnormalities, more chronic conditions, and more unmet mental health care needs than
women in other high-income countries. Black and Hispanic women are at elevated risk for adverse pregnancy
outcomes, hypertension, and diabetes. Sleep health is an important determinant, and Black and Hispanic
WOCBA report short, irregular, and fragmented sleep, poor sleep quality. Although behavioral sleep
interventions may improve sleep and sleep-related outcomes, they are hampered by lack of a comprehensive
understanding of multi-dimensional aspects of sleep health and the interactive influences of multi-level
personal, behavioral, cognitive, social, and environmental factors. The purpose of this community engaged
(CEnR) mixed methods study is to obtain in-depth understanding of multi-dimensional aspects or phenotypes
of sleep health; the contributions of personal, behavioral, cognitive, social, and environmental factors to sleep
health; and whether sleep-related behaviors and cognitions moderate the influence of social and environmental
influences on sleep health among 300 Black and Hispanic WOCBA. The scientific premise is that cognition and
behaviors serve as risk or protective factors for sleep health in the context of social and environmental
influences. We will address the following specific aims: (SA1) Characterize sleep health phenotypes based on
sleep continuity, duration, timing, satisfaction, alertness, and sleep disorders indices; (SA2) Determine (a) the
effects of social and environmental factors on sleep health phenotypes; (b) associations between sleep
behaviors and cognitions and sleep health phenotypes; and (c) the extent to which sleep behaviors and
cognitions moderate the effects of social and environmental factors on sleep health phenotypes. We will use
moderator analyses to identify protective (positive), harmful (negative), or absent interaction effects between
social and environmental influences and cognitive and behavioral factors and sleep health, while considering
potential covariates. (e.g., age and health); (SA3) Use sequential explanatory mixed methods and semi-
structured qualitative interviews to integrate quantitative findings from aims 1 and 2 to gain a comprehensive
understanding of sleep health. We will compare themes across sleep phenotypes and ethnic groups to
evaluate concordance, complementarity, or divergence and used the merged information to identify potential
targets for behavioral sleep intervention. This application responds to recommendations for community
engaged approaches to sleep and the National Sleep and Circadian Biology Research Plan’s focus on health
disparities in sleep. Community engagement and mixed methods will ensure a comprehensive perspective,
including the voices of women and their communities and support recommendations for future culturally
relevant multi-level sleep health interventions targeted to identified risk and protective factors among multi-
ethnic Black and Hispanic WOCBA."
10812573,"ABSTRACT: With nearly 45,000 rectal cancers to be diagnosed in 2023, the major clinical question of interest
is the identification of those patients who will achieve sustained clinical complete response (cCR, no detectable
macroscopic tumor) or true pCR (pathologic complete response, with very few/no tumor cells). With the recent
incorporation of options such as total neoadjuvant therapy (neoadjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiation),
these complete responder patients can comprise up to ~50% of the population. If these “true” complete response
patients could be reliably identified, they could avoid the major complications of rectal resection (anastomotic
leakage, pelvic sepsis, ureteric injury) and quality-of-life issues (permanent ostomy, fecal incontinence), with no
impact on their overall survival. However, there are no validated objective diagnostic criteria (using endoscopy,
MRI, and digital rectal exams) or serum/blood-based markers (e.g., carcinoembryonic antigen, CEA) that can
definitively identify true complete responders for organ-preserving strategies and non-operative management in
rectal cancers. Quantitative non-invasive imaging markers that accurately characterize pathologic tumor
regression in rectal cancers after neoadjuvant therapy could be hugely impactful in selecting complete response
patients who can be safely recommended organ-preservation vs partial/non-responders who require surgery.
To specifically capture subtle pathologic cues on MRI resulting from the desmoplastic fibrosis and tumor
response after chemoradiation/TNT, we have identified unique computer-extracted image features of gradient
response and morphological disruptions within the lesion (wall, tumor) and peri-lesion environment (lumen,
peritumoral fat). This R01 will build on these exciting findings to develop and validate a Radiomic Tumor
Response (RadTR) classifier to accurately identify complete responders after neoadjuvant therapy in rectal
cancers, via routine MRI. The RadTR classifier will additionally incorporate a novel “spatial diversity” descriptor
that captures macro-scale tissue organization and stromal composition that are biological hallmarks of complete
response. Using a multi-institutional cohort of ~900 patients, our validation of the RadTR classifier will focus on
three key criteria. (i) To enable clinical interpretability, we will conduct detailed histomorphological evaluation of
RadTR features via spatially mapped MRI and whole-mount rectal pathology specimens. (ii) For confirming
diagnostic reliability, the RadTR classifier will be comprehensively compared against clinical evaluation criteria
(endoscopy, MRI, digital rectal exam) as well as within a multi-reader study; to confirm performance
improvements in identifying CR via MRI. (iii) Towards ensuring equity in population performance for future clinical
deployment, the RadTR classifier will be validated across multiple institutions and populations using a national
clinical trial cohort of TNT in rectal cancers (NRG GI-002). To be clinically actionable for recommending organ-
preserving treatment in rectal cancers, RadTR model will target a 50% improvement in sensitivity for identifying
complete response as well as ensuring 95% specificity in identifying partial/non-pCR patients needing surgery."
10814227,"ABSTRACT
Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the sole connection between the eye and the brain. They are particularly
susceptible to degeneration, and their damage and death leads to vision loss in conditions like glaucoma, diabetic
retinopathy, optic nerve glioma, and optic neuritis. Most treatments for these diseases are not focused on
specifically rescuing RGCs, but on relieving apparent drivers of disease progression. For example, current
glaucoma treatments focus on reducing elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), but are not effective in the majority
of patients. Further, many glaucoma patients also have RGC degeneration without IOP elevations. Thus, new
treatments to preserve RGCs in degenerative diseases represent an important unmet clinical need. Although
RGC cell death leads to vision loss, RGC death in degenerative conditions is incomplete even in severely
affected patients and robust animal models. Understanding how some RGCs natively persist in degenerative
conditions can inform the development of new treatment strategies. To identify native coping strategies, we will
directly observe cellular traits of individual RGCs prior to and during the course of degeneration, focusing on
cellular homeostasis. We have established longitudinal, in vivo, 2-photon imaging of genetically encoded
biosensors in RGCs to directly observe energetic and Ca2+ homeostasis at single RGC resolution repeatedly
over a protracted period of time. This approach allows for measurements that would normally require either end
point sample collection, pooling of RGCs from multiple retinae, or both; limitations that obscure population
heterogeneity and individual cell dynamics. We will characterize baseline heterogeneity of energetic and Ca2+
homeostasis, along with dynamics following axon injury and directly relate these measurements with RGC
survival or death. Mechanisms of homeostasis are highly relevant to a range of degenerative diseases but have
yet to be thoroughly investigated in models of RGC degeneration. Our preliminary data indicate that mouse
RGCs that natively survive optic nerve crush have salient features of energetic and Ca2+ homeostasis that can
be distinguished from the RGC population as a whole prior to induction of degeneration. These results strongly
suggest that homeostatic set-points influence RGC survival outcomes in a severe degeneration model. Further,
we will conduct experiments to preserve RGCs in optic nerve crush models by manipulating these pathways to
mimic the properties of resilient RGCs using both gene overexpression or repression interventions. Doing so we
can validate which of our observations are correlative or causative. The goals of our proposal are thus to: more
thoroughly define the homeostatic fingerprint of well surviving RGCs; determine how axotomy induced
degeneration impinges on homeostasis of well-surviving versus poorly-surviving RGCs; and translate this
information into interventions that preserve RGCs that would otherwise degenerate. Taken together our
experiments will identify and validate new approaches towards protection of RGCs."
10814229,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) are the most fatal malignancies. Determining the optimal treatment
for patients relies on accurate diagnoses, which at present is only achievable by histopathological analyses of
the tissue obtained by invasive brain surgery. Operations in the brain instill tremendous anxiety in patients and
pose a significant risk for neurological morbidity and even mortality. In addition, accurate longitudinal monitoring
of response to treatment, and distinguishing recurrence from treatment-related effects (pseudoprogression),
relies on limited information obtained on radiologic imaging as the option to invasively obtain tissue
longitudinally over the course of disease is prohibitive due to the morbidity of repeat procedures. Given these
limitations, there has been significant interest in identifying non-invasive or “liquid” biomarkers for the diagnosis
of CNS tumors. Most groups have looked at mutations in circulating cell-free tumor DNA in the plasma or
cerebrospinal fluid. Unfortunately, CNS tumors usually do not release enough DNA into the systemic circulation
for such an approach to be reliable on a prospective clinical basis. Furthermore, searching for single mutations
does not allow for the discrimination of the many different types of brain tumors included in a differential
diagnosis. Instead of focusing on mutations, we focused on DNA methylation alterations that are highly
abundant and cancer specific. We developed, optimized, and validated a novel approach termed cell-free
methylated DNA immuno-precipitation and sequencing (cfMeDIP-seq) that involves isolating and enriching for
methylated fragments of tumor cell-free DNA using a methylation-specific antibody and then sequencing.
Published data from our group provides proof-of-principle that plasma cfMeDIP-seq can reliably and accurately
diagnose tumors throughout the body, including those in the CNS. Based on these data, we hypothesize that
methylation profiling of circulating DNA, via cfMeDIP-seq, identifies reliable biomarkers for the
diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of CNS tumors non-invasively. We will build upon our existing data
to use cfMeDIP-seq as a novel technique to establish and validate a comprehensive, non-invasive CNS tumor
classifier (Aim 1); build an accurate predictive model for the non-invasive prognostication of meningiomas (Aim
2); identify plasma biomarkers of response to treatment, recurrence, and malignant transformation in gliomas
(Aim 3); and identify methylation and plasma biomarkers of brain metastases development from systemic
cancers (Aim 4). Success in this proposal will genuinely help shape a much-needed paradigm-shift in the field
of neuro-oncology by establishing cfMeDIP-seq as a reliable liquid biomarker for the non-invasive diagnosis,
prognostication, and monitoring of patients with primary and metastatic CNS tumors.

10784856,"Powassan virus (POWV) is a neurovirulent tick-borne flavivirus (FV) emerging in the N.E. US. POWV is
present in tick saliva, injected into the skin during a 15-minute tick bite and causes a 10% fatal encephalitis
resulting in severe long-term neurologic damage in 50% of patients. There are currently no approved POWV
vaccines or prophylactics and the role of innate immunity in regulating POWV neuroinvasion, CNS cell
targeting and neuroinflammatory pathology is unknown.
 To reflect POWV spread from skin to the CNS, POWV LI9 was isolated from deer ticks directly in epithelial
cells. Mice inoculated s.c. with POWV LI9 develop lethal neurovirulent disease with overt murine brain damage.
Noting lethality in older mice, LI9 was found to be lethal in 90% of 50 week (wk), and <10% of 10 wk, old
C57/Bl6 mice. Consistent with age-dependent LI9 lethality, brains of 50 wk old mice had dramatically increased
CNS virus, chemokines, immune infiltrates and histopathology. Persistent passage of LI9 in IFN deficient
VeroE6 cells, resulted in an attenuated POWV (LI9-P), that fails to cause disease and instead protects mice
from lethal LI9 challenge. LI9-P is lethal if i.c. injected into mice, implying a block to CNS entry after peripheral
inoculation. LI9-P and LI9 differ by 9 residues in proteins associated with cell attachment, spread and IFN
regulation. In vitro, IFN prevents LI9/LI9-P infection, while LI9, but not LI9-P, inhibit IFNβ/λ induction. In vivo,
IFNλ treatment reduced LI9 levels by 2 logs in mouse brains. These findings suggest innate immune regulation
is a key determinant of LI9 neurovirulence and LI9-P attenuation, and rationalize analyzing neuroinvasive
mechanisms and IFNλ as a potential inhibitor of POWV spread to the CNS.
 Entering the CNS is critical for POWV neurovirulence, and the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and the blood-
cerebrospinal-fluid-barrier (BCSFB) are distinct defenses that protect the CNS. The BBB is formed by brain
microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), while the BCSFB is created by tight junctions of epithelial cells
(CPEpCs) in the choroid plexus. BBBs and BCSFBs are uniquely regulated by IFNs with IFNλ receptors
(IFNLRs) expressed on CPEpCs, not BMECs, and IFNλ responses are linked to CNS repair. In vitro, LI9 and
LI9-P infect CPEpCs and BMECs, suggesting that BBB or BCSFBs could function as CNS entry portals in vivo,
and that IFNλ may selectively block POWV neuroinvasion via BCSFBs to prevent lethal neurovirulent disease.
 In mice, IFN regulation by LI9 vs LI9-P in BBB, BCSFB cells, and the role of IFNs in restricting POWV
spread to the CNS are unknown. Proposed studies use a novel reverse genetics system to produce infectious
recombinant POWVs, chimeras and mutants that uniquely permit analysis of POWV IFN regulation
mechanisms and neurovirulence determinants in vivo. Studies define IFN responses that determine LI9 and
LI9-P infection and spread across neurovascular barriers in vitro and in vivo. Studies evaluate the therapeutic
potential of IFNλ inhibiting POWV neuroinvasion through BCSFBs in a lethal murine model."
10784857,"Abstract
Lipoproteins (LPs) play a substantial role in orchestrating symbiosis between commensal gut Bacteroides and
their host and dictate survival in the intestine, yet little is known about LP synthesis or acylation state in these
bacteria. Bacteroides are abundant in the human gut and communicate with the host via cell surface and outer
membrane vesicle (OMV)-packaged LPs. LPs are critical for the construction and integrity of the cell envelope,
and act as virulence factors in extraintestinal pathogens like Bacteroides fragilis, and critical players in nutrient
uptake in symbionts like Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. theta). The long-term goal of our research is to
understand fundamental aspects of Bacteroides physiology that facilitate adaptation to the host. Bacteroides
synthesize 2-3x as many LPs as many bacteria yet are missing recognizable homologs of key enzymes required
for LP maturation in other bacteria. Via genetic screen we identified a gene conserved within gut Bacteroides
that encodes a domain of unknown function (DUF4105) at its N-terminus and transmembrane domain at its C-
terminus and performs N-acylation of diacylated LPs. This Bacteroides Lipoprotein N-acyltransferase (BLnt)
complements lnt depletion in E. coli. BLnt is encoded downstream of a conserved gene encoding homology to
the alkaline phosphatase (AP) superfamily. B. theta ∆Blnt/AP mutants produce diacylated LP and display growth
deficiencies, altered cell morphology, and decreased OMV production suggesting this is a key fitness factor. Our
objective is to determine how BLnt performs N-acylation, and if deficiencies in BLnt/AP affect LP presentation,
cell morphology and interactions with the immune system. In Aim 1 we will determine the substrate
specificity, protein structure and localization of BLnt. Our working hypothesis is that BLnt performs N-
acylation of diacylated lipoproteins at the inner membrane. We will determine BLnt location and potential protein
partners, such as AP, via fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation. Mass spectrometry will be employed to
confirm the acylation state of endogenous B. theta proteins in wild type (WT), ∆BLnt and ∆BLnt/AP cells. We will
assay BLnt activity to identify its phospholipid substrate and determine its crystal structure. In Aim 2 we will
measure how BLnt influences cell shape, LP presentation, and immune activation. Our working hypothesis
is that loss of BLnt results in defects at the cell surface that influence growth and morphology. Using high-content
quantitative microscopy, we will measure cell shape and the abundance of surface proteins in WT, ∆BLnt and
∆BLnt/AP strains. We will measure the interaction of WT, mutant cells and their OMVs with macrophages and
HEK cells expressing various Toll-like receptors. The successful completion of these aims will reveal
fundamental details about Bacteroides LP maturation via a novel N-acyltransferase and provide a
comprehensive picture of how LP synthesis influences interactions with the host. Our work will have a positive
impact by revealing the molecular details of a conserved LP synthesis pathway unique to Bacteroides, providing
selective ways to manipulate their abundance in the gut or halt their proliferation in extraintestinal infection."
10789968,"Title: Next Generation Rat Models of ER+ Breast Cancer
Abstract: Despite the prevalence of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer (BCa), there are no
mammalian models that are immunocompetent and metastasize spontaneously to clinically relevant organs
such as bones. ER+ BCs comprise ~70% of BCa cases and are treated with surgical resection and adjuvant
endocrine therapies. Although the 5-year survival rate is high, risk of metastatic recurrence persists for dec-
ades, and 20-40% of ER+ BCa patients eventually succumb to metastatic disease, most often in bones. Our
limited knowledge of ER+ BCa has been largely derived from oversimplified cell line models and in vitro
experiments. Our available xenograft models exclude the critical immune component while genetically
engineered mouse models (GEMMs) rarely stably maintain ER expression and rely on ER signaling – and
none metastasize to bone, the most frequent site. As a result, very little is known about the initial tumori-
genesis process and bone metastasis of ER+ BCa, which greatly impedes our effort to develop new prevention
strategies or adjuvant therapeutics that can block/treat ER+ BCa bone metastasis. We have developed a
series of rat ER+ BCa models by intraductal injection of viruses to introduce genetic alterations. Our
preliminary data demonstrated that these rat ER+ mammary tumors: 1) developed in immunocompetent hosts,
2) showed endocrine therapy sensitivity or resistance, and 3) readily formed ER+ metastases including in bone
– all of which are key properties that are lacking in existing BCa models. Based on these, we hypothesize that
rat-based intraductal injection models (RIIMs) of breast cancer faithfully recapitulate human ER+ BCa in
terms of tumor initiation, metastasis, and therapeutic responses. We will pursue the following three aims: (1)
To characterize early progression of ER+ BCa in RIIM models. (2) To characterize the metastatic behaviors of
ER+ BCa in RIIM models. (3) To credential ER+ RIIM models in recapitulating therapeutic responses and
resistance mechanisms of human ER+ BCa."

The proposed Leukemia Translational Science Center (LTSC), will generate, coordinate and lead translational
studies in leukemia within ECOG-ACRIN and within the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). The LTSC will
serve as the central hub for studies of the Leukemia Laboratory Committee (LLC), with the support of the
Leukemia Translational Laboratory (LTRL) and the Leukemia Tissue Bank (LTB), and a comprehensive
Leukemia Data Warehouse. The LTSC is led by R. Levine, A. Melnick, and A. Ferrando. They have developed
an extensive track record in translational research leadership and implementation of state-of-the-art correlative
studies in leukemia biology. The LTSC is further enhanced through its partnership with the MSK Centers for
Molecular Oncology and Center for Hematologic Malignancies, which provide access to high-throughput
genomics technologies, state-of-the-art genomic platforms, computational resources, and the capability to
perform extensive, CLIA-certified, clinical genomics assays. In order to maximally accelerate high quality

10798625,"Objective: The objective of this proposal is to train Dr. Aubrey Chan, MD/PhD, dual-boarded in internal
medicine and psychiatry, to become an independent VA physician-scientist. He will be mentored in state-of-
the-art neuroscience research techniques in recording neural signals by his mentors Drs. Rainbo Hultman and
Nandakumar Narayanan, and he will be mentored in the cutting-edge analytical techniques applied to these
signals by Dr. Matthew Howard. Dr. John Wemmie will serve as the career development mentor, providing
guidance in Dr. Chan’s development as a principal investigator, managing lab personnel, mentoring graduate
students, scientific communication, and grantsmanship.
 These research techniques will be applied to a novel, circuit-wide analysis of defensive responses by
recording from and analyzing signals of multiple brain regions simultaneously. Defensive responses are
physiological, emotional, and behavioral changes that occur when an organism is faced with a threat.
Excessively active or exaggerated defensive responses underlie psychiatric illnesses like post-traumatic stress
disorder, an illness that is highly prevalent in the veteran population, and which causes tremendous distress,
disability, and suicide in veterans. Defensive responses will be studied in mice in response to carbon dioxide
(CO2), a naturalistic stimulus which represents the interoceptive (internal) threat of suffocation. This threat will
be compared and contrasted with exposure to trimethylthiazoline (TMT), a component of fox odor, representing
the naturalistic but exteroceptive (external) threat of a predator. Responses will be analyzed both in a naïve
state and after animals are exposed to a traumatic, chronic social defeat stress (CSDS).
 Dr. Chan will also dedicate time to the clinical care of veterans. Being dual-trained in internal medicine and
psychiatry, he is particularly suited to treating the complex comorbid conditions often seen in veterans. He will
work on the inpatient psychiatric unit and the psychiatric consult-liaison service at the Iowa City VA Medical
Center.
Methods: Custom electrodes will be constructed and stereotactically implanted into multiple mouse brain sites.
After recovery from surgery, awake, behaving mice will be exposed to threatening stimuli while neural
recordings are performed. Aim 1 will study the effects of CO2 and TMT in naïve animals, with follow-up
exposures after animals have undergone CSDS. Behaviors will be matched against neural signals. Neural
signals will be evaluated for local field potential (LFP) power, firing rates of individual neurons, and for
functional connectivity measures between brain sites. In addition, the bispectral & electome methods will be
used to detect salient neurophysiological features that predict behaviors. Aim 2 will use optogenetic
manipulation of neural signals to modify defensive behaviors. To facilitate these studies, Dr. Chan will take
coursework in automated behavioral scoring and statistical analysis.
Expected Results: The proposal will have these main outcomes: 1) it will establish a foundational map of the
defensive response brain circuit in both naïve mice and mice that have undergone social defeat stress. 2) by
comparing CO2 threat and TMT threat, it will also establish which neural mechanisms are shared and which
are unique to specific threat modalities. 3) it will identify neurophysiological features that predict animal
behavior and test causality by manipulating neural signals to alter behavior. 4) The mentorship of Dr. Howard
will enable rapid translation of these findings into studies in neurosurgical human subjects, accelerating the
development of potential therapies for veterans. 5) It will establish the applicant as an expert in the field of
network neurophysiology related to PTSD and propel him forward in his career as a VA physician-scientist."
10930982,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous genetic loci associated with almost all
complex human diseases. Much of this success, particularly the accelerated findings in recent years, is credited
to the development of deeply phenotyped population biobanks with matched genomic data. However, a crucial
limitation of these population biobanks is the often-insufficient number of disease cases for late-life health
outcomes, which is why the introduction of the concept of GWAS-by-proxy (GWAX) served as a landmark in the
field. The GWAX study design is based on a simple idea – although biobank participants may not have their own
diagnosis on late-life disease outcomes, they provide such diagnosis of their parents through the family health
history survey; they also (indirectly) provide parental genetic data, as their biological child. Since this study,
GWAX has been widely used in genetic studies for many diseases, but particularly frequently for
neurodegenerative diseases. Every recent Alzheimer’s disease (AD) GWAS performed meta-analysis to
combined case-control associations with GWAX proxy associations to boost sample size and statistical power.
However, methodological issues in GWAX and the quality of its association results have not been carefully
investigated. We demonstrate pervasive biases in current GWAX approaches, causing substantial divergence
of GWAS and GWAX results. In addition, we demonstrate that education is an important social factor at the
center of many of these biases. Since cognition is such a crucial marker for AD, biases caused by
education/cognition become particularly important in AD genetics research and will give completely misleading
results if not handled properly. Our proposal takes advantage of extensive family health history data available in
the AllofUs research program and recent statistical advances developed by our investigator team in
decomposing social genetic effects with summary statistics of multi-generational GWAS. We aim to expand
these methods to rigorously and comprehensively characterize the biases in current GWAX results. Our central
hypothesis is that GWAX associations based on family health history as proxy for disease phenotypes
are substantially affected by survival bias and non-random over- and under-report of family member’s
illness, and will lead to erroneous results and conclusions for analyses that naively combine these
associations with case-control GWAS results. Successful completion of this proposal will improve scientific
understanding of the genetic underpinnings of family health history, shed important light on the design and
analysis of mid-aged biobank cohorts, and provide novel analytical strategies for future genetic studies
leveraging family health history data in population biobanks."
10934571,"Project Summary
A pharmacogenomics-guided drug policy includes the genomic profile of an individual’s drug response with other
clinical characteristics (age, body weight, etc.) and may improve the safety and effectiveness of drug therapy.
Thus, in recent years several medical centers in the United States have implemented clinical pharmacogenomics
services to support such policies. Among the services that can be supported, preemptive clinical genotyping
services produce pharmacogenomic data before it is known that a particular drug may be needed by a patient.
Preemptive clinical genotyping services that cover genetic markers primarily based on populations of European
ancestry, however, can have reduced performance of a policy to identify well-tolerated medications in
understudied groups. Worse performance in the understudied groups is, in part, due to being more likely to have
an indeterminate drug response phenotype when compared to a European ancestry group. Having more
indeterminate drug response statuses in some racial subgroups translates in to more occurrences of “missing
data” in assessments of an individuals’ drug response, thus resulting in lower racial fairness. One possible
solution to this challenge of knowing if low racial fairness is a problem, is to estimate the pharmacogenomic-
guided drug policy performance and fairness for different racial subgroups a priori. The specific objective of
this project is to use All of Us research program (AoU) data to derive evidence of the potential unintended
consequence of low racial fairness that can exist with a new pharmacogenomic-guided drug policy. The
AoU data is uniquely suited to generate such evidence given that it includes a diversity of racial subgroups and
a variety of data types, including from electronic health records and clinical whole genome sequencing data. We
will conduct an observational cohort study using the AoU data to assess the performance of pharmacogenomics-
guided drug policies to identify well-tolerated medications (Aim 1), and quantify the potential impact of differential
data access among patients on performance (Aim 2). We will also study the impact of differential data access
on the racial fairness of pharmacogenomics-guided drug policy (Aim 3). Outcomes of this work will demonstrate
one strategy to produce evidence from real-world data that can be expanded upon and studied further in future
research. Presenting this type of evidence prior to approving pharmacogenomics-guided drug policy holds
promise to inform Pharmacy & Therapeutics committee decision-making."

Podocyte injury is a major event in both primary glomerular disease such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
(FSGS) and secondary glomerular disease such as diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The treatment options for
these diseases are very limited. Through systems biology analysis, we identified Protein S (PS) and Tyro3
pathway as a major protective pathway in early DKD. PS binds to Tyro3, one of the TAM receptors (Tyro3, Axl,
and Mer), which belong to a family of receptor tyrosine kinases that mediate anti- inflammation and cell survival.
Over last several years, we have provided a large amount of data to support a podocyte protective role of PS-
Tyro3 in both human and mouse glomerular disease and DKD and these findings suggest that Tyro3 could be a
podocyte-protective drug target for treatment of DKD and FSGS. Therefore, we developed specific Tyro3
agonists. Among them, we found that compound 8 (C-8) and 10 (C-10) had strong activity as compared to others
and therefore we selected them for further studies. We confirmed that C-10 bound directly with Tyro3 and
induced its phosphorylation while it did not affect other two TAM receptors (Axl and Mer). Therefore, C-10 is a
specific Tyro3 agonist. In vivo, we confirmed that C-10 attenuated proteinuria, glomerular injury, podocyte loss
and foot process effacement in both Adriamycin-induced nephropathy mice and diabetic db/db mice, while these
renal protective effects are lost in Tyro3 knockout mice, indicating that C-10 improves podocyte injury and
glomerular disease through activation of Tyro3. Therefore, we believe that C-10 could be potentially our lead
compound. These data are included in our recent paper in JCI Insights [Zhong F 2023]. In addition, our
unpublished data also confirmed that C-8 had similar renal protective effects in animal models of kidney disease.
Since C-8 has structural difference from C-10, C-8 could be used as our back-up compound. Based on these
findings, we have applied a patent through VA (US Patent App 63-224,827 VA ID 2021-247). In this VA drug
development grant, we propose the specific aims below to accelerate the development of these drugs as new
therapy for DKD and FSGS, and we hope to prepare an IND application during or at the end of this application.
Specific Aim 1: Characterize drug-like properties of C-10 and C-8 and determine the therapeutic window
of these compounds as a novel therapy of glomerular disease. In the Aim 1.1, we will study drug metabolism
and pharmacokinetics (DMPK), dose regimen, toxicity profiles of C10 and C-8. In the aim 1.2, we will further
define the therapeutic window and the effective dosage of C-10 and C-8 in mouse remnant kidney model with
5/6 nephrectomy and diabetic BTBR ob/ob mice based on the DMPK data.
Specific Aim 2: Build a pipeline of backup compounds for C10 and C-8 to augment drug discovery
success rate. In the Aim 2.1, we will design and synthesize novel Tyro3 agonists with new structures by using
peptidomimetics approaches. In the Aim 2.2, we will perform biological screening of these new compounds by
using newly developed in vitro screening assays and evaluate in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic properties,
and determine the toxicity profile of the selected compounds. In the Aim 2.3, we will select three new compounds
from the above studies for further validation of their efficacy in mouse remnant kidney model with 5/6
nephrectomy and diabetic BTBR ob/ob mice."
10799230,"Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly prevalent in Veterans and is associated with poor treatment
outcomes. Evidence-based treatments (EBTs), such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), show utility in
reducing maladaptive drinking and restoring healthy goals, but more than two thirds of treatment completers
relapse within a year. Anhedonia, i.e., a reduced interest in rewarding activities, is commonly observed in AUD
patients and predicts poorer response to psychiatric treatment. Anhedonic symptoms manifest through a
dopaminergic deficit state in the frontostriatal reward circuitry, which contributes to the reinforcement of alcohol
use as a fast-acting mood-regulating strategy. Moreover, while anhedonia is known to hinder goal-directed
reward behavior, this presentation is multi-faceted, and may impact different reward processing mechanisms,
e.g., learning, anticipating, pursuing, and receiving rewards. However, the degree to which these reward
behavior mechanisms relate to AUD outcomes remains poorly understood and have not been investigated in
Veterans. Understanding these relationships could help shed light on factors that facilitate or hinder AUD
recovery and may help identify specific neurobehavioral targets not adequately addressed in standard care to
guide the development of new interventions. To address these questions, we propose to use computational
modeling and functional neuroimaging to mechanistically characterize the relationships between
anhedonia and drinking behavior in treatment-seeking Veterans with AUD. Computational modeling,
particularly in concert with neuroimaging, provides detailed mechanistic insights into the neurobiology of
cognitive processes, and such methods have been shown to be more accurate in predicting clinical outcomes,
relative to standard behavioral and neuroimaging analysis. We will capitalize on this approach to delineate robust
anhedonia-driven predictors of AUD treatment responsiveness in Veterans.
 A total 124 Veterans with AUD will be recruited through a recently funded clinical trial as they enroll in 12
weeks of group-based CBT (standard care EBT). Participants will further be randomized to an adjunctive
computer-based protocol, i.e., control (sham) or approach-avoidance training (AAT). Because AAT is aimed at
reducing patients’ habitual approach bias towards alcohol cues, it may provide incremental benefits in shifting
approach behaviors from reflexive to more goal-driven. At baseline, 12-, and 24-weeks after treatment onset,
participants will complete a clinical assessment and 2 multi-arm bandit (MAB) tasks (in classic and social
conditions, to be compared in exploratory analyses), in which they must choose on each trial from among a set
of options with unknown reward probabilities, with the goal of maximizing total rewards. Concurrent brain activity
will be measured in a subset of 62 participants. Using Bayesian modeling, we will derive individual parameters
of reward learning (i.e., perceived stability) and reward maximization. Neural activity tracking participants’ model-
based reward expectations and associated prediction errors will be examined during anticipation and receipt of
reward outcomes, respectively. Aim 1 is to determine the degree to which baseline neurocomputational
markers of anhedonia predict alcohol recovery in Veterans with AUD. Aim 2 is to assess the relationship
between change in goal-directed reward behavior and alcohol use reduction after AUD treatment in
Veterans. Aim 3 is to explore the degree to which baseline neurocomputational markers of anhedonia
predict dropout from EBT treatment for alcohol recovery in Veterans with AUD. The moderating effect of
adjunctive training type on these relationships will also be investigated (Aims 1-3). This project is expected
to improve our understanding of how anhedonia contributes to maladaptive alcohol use vs AUD recovery, and
to identify understudied mechanisms of change that are critical for developing new, mechanistically informed
interventions to boost healthy reward processing in Veterans."
10815864,"Project Summary/Abstract
Recently, multiple human genetic studies have identified the critical role of the immune system in the
pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). For example, microglia phagocytose amyloid beta (Abeta) and
regulate brain immune function by secreting cytokines and chemokines. Because previous studies have
suggested both protective and detrimental effects of microglial activity in AD, how microglial AD risk genes, such
as PU.1, affect microglial function still remains unclear. Therefore, investigating the role of AD genetic risk factors
in microglia will provide critical insight into the pathobiology of the disease, potentially revealing key regulators
of underlying disease mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets. An AD genetic risk factor, PU.1, is a critical
transcription factor selectively expressed in microglia in the brain. We hypothesize that PU.1 affects several
transcription pathways, Abeta metabolism and other AD-related pathologies by regulating their immune function.
To test this hypothesis, we will apply several innovative technologies, including single-cell RNA-sequencing,
quantitative proteomics, super-resolution microscopy, human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia
and neurons, multi-electrode arrays, electrophysiology, and the simultaneous Positron Emission Tomography-
Magnetic Resonance Imaging, in collaboration of multiple collaborators with extensive experience in these
methods. In aim 1, we will determine how downregulating PU.1 affects microglial and neuronal phenotypes and
perform unbiased transcriptomic and proteomic analyses to identify key downstream regulators. In aim 2, we will
investigate the functional interaction between microglia and neurons using human induced pluripotent stem cells
after regulating PU.1 expression. In aim 3, we will terminate how microglial PU.1 affects AD phenotypes when it
is regulated before and after the onset of amyloid pathology."

An innovative new surgical technique - the agonist-antagonist myoneural interface (AMI) - restores
agonist-antagonist muscle dynamics in the residual limb to promote improvements in residual limb function
after lower limb loss. Disregarding the dynamic coupling of agonist-antagonist muscle pairs during traditional
amputation eliminates the natural contraction-relaxation dynamics of coupled muscles that sends sensory
information about limb speed and position to the brain. This lack of information results in decreased
proprioception and the ability to control a muscle-driven prosthesis. While this surgical technique is designed to
improve prosthesis control via electromyography (EMG) recordings in the residual limb, initial work suggests
that the benefits of AMI (e.g., increased prosthesis embodiment, residual limb volume) may extend to
conventional prostheses. However, the impacts of AMI on functional tasks such as walking or recovering
from walking perturbations when using a conventional prosthesis are unknown. We propose that the AMI
technique will increase the quality and quantity of sensory information received by the central nervous system,
improve the subsequent motor plan, and improve biomechanics during walking and perturbed walking with a
conventional prosthesis. Our central hypothesis is that by connecting agonist-antagonist muscles, the
suggested benefits of AMI will apply to use with conventional prostheses due to increased residual limb
proprioception and prosthesis embodiment. We will test our hypothesis through three specific aims. We will
prospectively compare locomotion mechanics in a cohort of persons with an AMI-amputation against those
with a traditional amputation using a measure of gait smoothness. We will also collect EMG data within the
residual limb during walking to assess residual limb muscle activations during walking as a means to validate the
scientific premise of AMI during walking with a conventional prosthesis. Second, we will evaluate the influence
of AMI on the response to perturbations during walking, simulating real-world trip or slip scenarios that have
fall-risk implications. Lastly, we will investigate the influence of self-reported prosthesis embodiment on
locomotion mechanics in each cohort to support our hypothesis that persons with AMI walk with improved
mechanics partly due to increased prosthesis embodiment. be related to greater gait smoothness and lesser
trunk angles and velocity during trip recovery. The proposed experiments will provide preliminary evidence of
AMI’s ability to improve locomotion mechanics, tripping recovery, and the influence of prosthesis embodiment
on locomotion with a conventional prosthesis. Findings will determine near-term, pragmatic benefits to AMI
amputation in patients who do not have access to a specialized neuroprosthesis."

Our long-term objective is to tackle antibiotic resistance by developing accurate and interpretable prediction
machine learning models that could be used clinically to speed up the care of patients with bacterial infections.
Current approaches to diagnosing bacterial infections rely on first culturing a pathogen from a collected specimen
followed by a variety of phenotypic tests to determine what antibiotic a particular bacterial isolate would be
sensitive or resistant to. This process can, in many cases, take days to finish. Developing an accurate way to
predict antibiotic resistance utilizing whole-genome sequencing data without the need for phenotypic testing is
the overall goal of this project. Our team applies the latest advances in deep learning and cloud computation.
We will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) Curate a large dataset and develop a deep-learning prediction
model with state-of-the-art accuracies for a wide range of bacterial species and antibiotic combinations; 2)
Develop personalized machine learning models for chronic infections; 3) create open-sourced scalable user-
friendly resources for the broad research community. The successful completion of this work will provide a
paradigm shift in the way we diagnose bacterial infections and speed up the time to providing the correct
antibiotic for a specific pathogen."
10819480,"Project Summary / Abstract
Thromboembolic stroke is a leading cause of death from atrial fibrillation (AF). Current strategies to prevent
AF-induced stroke, such as oral anticoagulants, have significant risks and incompletely suppress stroke. Atrial
contractility is significantly reduced in AF and contributes to stroke risk; however, an incomplete understanding
of mechanisms regulating sarcomere function has hindered development of therapeutic approaches targeting
atrial contractile dysfunction. Recent insights from our lab and others have demonstrated that hypo-
phosphorylation of atrial myosin light chain (MLC2a) is a major contributor to atrial contractile dysfunction in
AF. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 12C (PPP1R12C)
contributes to MLC2a dephosphorylation and atrial hypocontractility in AF. The long-term goal of this project is
to determine the mechanisms by which protein phosphatase regulatory and catalytic subunits regulate MLC2a
phosphorylation and myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, and determine how reduced MLC2a phosphorylation
contributes to atrial hypocontractility, AF susceptibility, and stroke. The objective of this application is to
evaluate PPP1R12C protein expression and activity as a regulator of atrial Ca2+ sensitivity and atrial
contractility in vivo. Whereas we have shown that increased PPP1R12C protein expression is associated with
MLC2a dephosphorylation in human AF patients and mouse models of AF, the mechanisms regulating
PPP1R12C expression remain unknown. Furthermore, the functional significance of PPP1R12C deletion or
pharmacologic PPP1R12C inhibition remain untested. The central hypothesis is that there is an inverse
relationship between PPP1R12C activity and atrial contractility, and that inhibition of PPP1R12C expression or
activity will increase atrial contractility in AF. To test this hypothesis, three Specific Aims are proposed: Aim 1-
To determine the mechanism whereby AngII signaling increases PPP1R12C expression; Aim 2- To assess
whether genetic knockout of Ppp1r12c in mice increases atrial contractility; Aim 3 - To validate pharmacologic
approaches to modifying PPP1R12C activity in vivo. The innovation of our project is that we are evaluating
atrial hypocontractility, the only limb of Virchow's triad unaddressed for stroke prevention in AF. The proposed
project would, for the first time, attempt to intervene upon the atrial contractile substrate and modify atrial
cardiomyopathy in vivo. Our expected outcome from completion of the proposed Aims is an enhanced
understanding of the mechanisms underlying atrial contractile dysfunction in AF, and validation of targets to
increase atrial contractility and reduce stroke risk in AF."
10819482,"The role of NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in iron homeostasis and ferroptosis Iron is essential for nearly all forms of life given the requirement for iron in oxygen binding and transport, ATP production, and DNA replication and repair. Cells must maintain sufficient iron levels to support these processes; however, iron excess can be detrimental given the role of iron in generation of toxic reactive oxygen species. To achieve this balance, cellular iron is primarily stored in a non-toxic form in ferritin, a protein complex composed of 24 subunits of ferritin light and heavy chain subunits. However, the mechanism of iron release from ferritin in times of cellular demand was unclear until recently. We identified NCOA4 as the selective cargo receptor that mediates the autophagic degradation of ferritin (“ferritinophagy”) thereby releasing iron for use by the cell. Flux through the ferritinophagy pathway is dependent on NCOA4 protein levels which are regulated by intracellular iron levels. Under iron-replete cellular conditions, NCOA4 binding to HERC2, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is increased, leading to proteasomal degradation of NCOA4. Decreased NCOA4 levels inhibit ferritinophagy thereby increasing ferritin iron storage. Under iron-deficient conditions, HERC2 binding to NCOA4 is decreased, leading to NCOA4 stabilization and induction of ferritinophagy for iron release. Ferritinophagy is involved in iron- dependent physiological processes such as erythropoiesis, where NCOA4 mediates ferritin iron release for mitochondrial heme synthesis. Recently, in cell culture models, ferritinophagy has been shown to regulate ferroptosis, a newly described form of iron-dependent cell death mediated by excess lipid peroxidation. Dysregulation of iron metabolism and ferroptosis have been described in hemochromatosis and acute ischemic kidney injury; however, little is known about the in vivo role of ferritinophagy in regulating sensitivity to ferroptosis. In the proposed work, we will examine the hypothesis that NCOA4 is a key regulator of cellular and systemic iron homeostasis with specific temporal and spatial roles in regulating iron homeostasis in physiology and pathophysiology. Specific Aim 1 will define the biochemical mechanisms regulating NCOA4 activity in cells using an integrated quantitative proteomic and cell biologic experimentation workflow. In specific aim 2, we will determine the temporal and spatial dependency of ferritinophagy in vivo for regulating systemic iron homeostasis and erythropoiesis using novel mouse models of NCOA4 knockout and over-expression. Finally, specific aim 3 will focus on examining a role for NCOA4 in regulating sensitivity to ferroptosis in vivo under pathophysiologic conditions. Together, the proposed in vitro and in vivo studies will identify fundamental roles of NCOA4 in sensing and responding to iron deficiency and overload and determine the utility of pursuing NCOA4 as a therapeutic target for multiple iron-related disorders."
10819485,"ABSTRACT
Age-related immune dysregulation and increases in inflammation, termed inflammaging, have been
consistently implicated in most common age-related diseases, but the precise etiology of inter-individual
differences in inflammaging are unknown. Changes in immunity and inflammation occur throughout the life
course, but research on these processes among non-elderly populations has been limited. This is important
because identifying sources of biological aging and inflammation before individuals reach older age may help
identify points for intervention. The composition of the gut microbiota has been shown in animal models to
have profound influence over, and interactions with, the immune system. Findings from germ-free mice
suggest that commensal gut microbes are a key cause of inflammaging, but this hypothesis has not been well-
explored in humans. There are currently very few data examining how the microbiome relates to the
fundamental aspects of aging biology, specifically inflammatory phenotypes and genomic markers of biological
age. We propose to fill gaps in current microbiome research on aging, through the collection and analysis of
oral and gut microbiome data in The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a
nationally representative longitudinal cohort of adults with extensive social environment data and existing or
ongoing analyses of genomic and phenotypic markers of inflammation and aging. The specific aims include
the: 1) Collection of tongue and stool specimens with which to characterize the oral and gut microbiome in a
nationally-representative sample (N ~10,155) of Add Health participants (mean age ~40); 2) Testing the
association between the microbiome and biomarkers of aging and inflammation, and the creation of a novel
“microbiome age clock”; 3) Examination of the relationships between life course exposures and microbiome
species related to biomarkers of aging and inflammation as an adult; 4) Documentation and dissemination of
data generated from this project. This proposal represents the first study to assess how the oral and gut
microbiome are associated with biomarkers of DNA methylation aging and inflammation in a large US
representative sample of midlife adults. Our study will significantly advance our understanding of the life
course exposures from gestation to adulthood that shape microbiome markers of inflammaging and DNA
methylation aging. This is crucial because identifying microbiome markers of biological aging in adulthood will
allow us to better identify signs of early aging via the microbiome."
10819493,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with considerable functional impairment and reduced quality of life.
Consistent daily engagement in self-management behaviors, such as physical activity, medication adherence,
and monitoring blood glucose is required to maintain daily functioning, quality of life, and glucose control.
However, most Veterans do not meet daily self-management targets, particularly physical activity. This is
problematic as physical activity is a cornerstone of T2D self-management and represents a fundamental
component of functioning. Self-management occurs in the context of patients’ own environments. Thus,
assessments at healthcare visits likely miss significant amounts of variability in self-management behaviors as
well as daily fluctuations in comorbid symptoms and social contextual factors that influence self-management.
 The conceptual model guiding the proposal is based on temporal self-regulation theory and posits that
because T2D is generally asymptomatic, consequences of poor self-management and benefits of consistent
self-management are not salient in the moment. For Veterans with T2D, comorbid symptoms such as mood,
pain, and stress are common time-varying momentary barriers to self-management that may particularly
impact physical activity. Social context is another well-established set of factors related to self-management
among people with T2D. Most research on barriers and facilitators of T2D self-management is cross-sectional
and assumes comorbid symptoms and contextual factors are static. Current research does not address the
time-varying nature in which these comorbid symptoms and social contextual factors impact physical activity
and other self-management behaviors within individuals. Thus, the overarching aim of the current proposal is
to understand daily, time-varying factors (comorbid symptoms, social context) that are particularly relevant to
Veterans and that influence physical activity, T2D self-management, daily functioning, and quality of life.
 We will enroll 95 (5 test participants and 90 for the analytic sample) Veterans with T2D and will use
ecological momentary assessment (EMA), a method of real-time data collection. Participants will receive 5
momentary EMA surveys and 1 daily EMA survey per day, in which Veterans will report on comorbid
symptoms (mood, stress, pain, PTSD), social support, social interactions, physical activity and other self-
management behaviors, randomly, during pre-programmed intervals in their natural environment over a 14-day
sampling period. Accelerometry will also assess physical activity. With these data, we will address 4 aims: Aim
1) Use EMA to examine within-person time-varying relationships among daily comorbid symptoms (depressed
mood, stress, pain, PTSD) and within-day time spent doing physical activities; Aim 2) Use EMA to examine
within-person social contextual factors (social support, social interactions) and daily time spent doing physical
activities; Exploratory Aim 1) Explore relationships among other within-person time-varying factors, social
contextual factors, between-person demographic and T2D specific characteristics, and T2D self-management
behaviors that may impact daily functioning and quality of life; and Exploratory Aim 2) Leverage intensive
longitudinal data to explore temporal relationships among study variables using network analysis.
 The successful completion of this CDA will provide the applicant with the necessary training and data to
pursue a VA Merit to further examine the complexity of real-world barriers and facilitators of T2D self-
management. Results from the current study will help to develop both assessment tools and clinical
interventions. Assessment tools developed from the present study can inform clinical decision making that
takes into account barriers to self-management that occur outside of medical appointments. Clinical
applications include tailored, adaptive technology-supported interventions that provide the right type and
amount of support, at the right time by adapting to an individual’s changing internal and contextual state."

The GWAS community has now identified many thousands of variants that affect complex traits, but there is
still a critical gap in our ability to interpret why these variants matter. While some signals affect genes that are
directly involved in the relevant disease processes, many other signals likely arise due to indirect trans-
regulatory effects on core disease genes and pathways. There has been huge progress in recent years on
methods to identify variants that affect cis-regulation of nearby genes, but it remains extremely difficult to
measure and interpret how and whether those associated genes may affect disease processes directly or via
trans-acting effects on other genes. In this grant we propose to develop new experimental and computational
methods to help bridge this critical gap. We have recently developed two complementary experimental
techniques that use CRISPR-perturbations to map out the upstream regulators and downstream targets of a
gene of interest. We will work on methodological improvements for these methods, and apply them in effector
T cells and regulatory T cells to map out gene regulatory networks in these important immune cell types. We
will develop new computational methods for inferring gene networks using these data. Finally, we will develop
and implement new methods for interpreting autoimmune disease loci in light of the network information. This
project will establish new high throughput techniques for elucidating regulatory relationships among genes and
for using these to interpret GWAS data."

 An exciting recent development for high spatial resolution deep tissue imaging is long wavelength three-
photon fluorescence microscopy (3PM). Since its first demonstration of imaging subcortical structures in the
mouse brain, 3PM has driven rapid progress in deep tissue imaging beyond the depth limit of two-photon
fluorescence microscopy (2PM). Long-wavelength 3PM is perhaps the most promising new technology for deep
imaging within scattering biological tissues, and has potential impacts in a large number of biomedical fields such
as neuroscience, immunology, and cancer biology. On the other hand, there are a number of challenges that
must be overcome before 3PM can reach its full potential. Because it is a higher-order nonlinear process, three-
photon excitation (3PE) is inherently weaker than two-photon excitation (2PE). The weak signal strength of 3PM
is particularly problematic for fast imaging of dynamic cellular process. Furthermore, the laser sources for 3PM
are not yet optimized for deep tissue penetration, and the complexity and cost of the excitation source is a major
barrier for the applications of 3PM in a typical biomedical research lab. Finally, nearly all 3PM applications today
are in the brains. Reaching anatomical frontiers is equally possible in other organs with 3PM, but explicit
demonstrations of intravital imaging in novel locations are needed to bring deep imaging capability to other
biological systems. The research activity of this proposal will directly address the above challenges for in vivo
deep tissue 3PM. We will develop a new generation of 3PM that will improve the performance of existing 3PM
by two orders of magnitude and enable multi-color deep tissue imaging with a single excitation wavelength. We
will demonstrate the unprecedented imaging capabilities with a low-cost, fiber-based laser system, removing a
key barrier for the deployment of 3PM in biology labs. Furthermore, by applying our techniques to a wide variety
of biological systems, we will create a valuable knowledge base for the applications of 3PM. Our development
of the next generation 3PM parallels the development of 2PM, where the concerted development effort in lasers,
microscopes, and biological applications in the 1990s made 2PM ubiquitous in biomedical research labs by the
early 2000s. Our vision is to make deep, fast 3PM a routine instrument for a wide variety of biomedical
applications just as 2PM does in the shallower regions of biological tissues and organs. The successful
completion of this program will enable visualization of dynamic process at the sub-cellular level in intact organs
and animal models that are completely beyond the reach of any existing imaging techniques."

This application is submitted in response to RFA-D-21-019: Single Cell Opioid Responses in the Context of HIV
(SCORCH) Program Expansion: CNS Data Generation for Chronic Opioid, Methamphetamine, and/or Cocaine
Exposures. We have assembled an outstanding team of investigators with world-class expertise in HIV virology,
addiction neurobiology, and single cell transcriptomics. We will leverage state-of-the-art single-nuclei RNA
sequencing (snRNA-seq) coupled to single-nuclei epigenetics (snATAC-seq) to define the transcriptional and
epigenetic landscape of neuronal and nonneuronal cells in addiction-relevant brain cells of HIV-infected mice
that compulsively self-administer cocaine. In this manner we will identify cell types and brain sites in which HIV
and cocaine interact to exacerbate the negative impact of HIV infection on the brain and contribute to the
persistence of cocaine use disorder in infected individuals. To facilitate this goal, we have developed an extended
access intravenous cocaine self-administration procedure for mice that precipitates compulsive-like response for
cocaine that is resistant to negative outcome (contingently delivered noxious foot shocks). We will utilize EcoHIV,
which is a modified HIV strain that can infect conventional immunocompetent mice. The Chromium Single Cell
Multiome ATAC and Gene Expression assay and Multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization
(MERFISH) will be used to identify cocaine and/or HIV-responsive cells in the brain with unprecedented cellular
and spatial resolution. We will confirm our major findings using postmortem brain tissues from cocaine-
experienced HIV-infected individuals. Our goals will be accomplished through the following four specific aims. In
Aim 1, we will characterize compulsive-like cocaine intake in control and HIV-infected mice and determine the
impact of antiretroviral treatment (ART) on cocaine response in these mice. In Aim 2, we will use snRNA-seq
and Mulitome assays to identify those cells that show the most robust transcriptional and epigenetic plasticity to
cocaine consumption and HIV infection. In Aim 3, we will use MERFISH to confirm and validate our major snRNA-
seq and Multiome assay findings, and generate more refined spatially resolved maps of those cells most
impacted by cocaine and/or HIV. In Aim 4, we will confirm our major findings using post-mortem human brain
tissues. This highly innovative, collaborative and multidisciplinary program of research promises to yield
fundamental new insights into disease-related interactions between HIV infection and cocaine use."
10819553,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) affect millions of people and are especially prevalent in the elderly
population. LUTS are likely caused or exacerbated by dysfunction of neural circuits controlling bladder function.
Despite some progress in our understanding of the circuits that control reflex and voluntary micturition, significant
knowledge gaps remain. An enhanced understanding of how finely tuned and effective neural control over
bladder function is achieved is central to efforts directed at developing newer and more targeted treatments for
LUTS. The objective in this particular application is to understand which neurons detect, relay and process the
bladder distention signal, so that it ultimately becomes integrated into coherent neural control for proper bladder
function. The central hypothesis is that periaqueductal gray (PAG) neurons that receive bladder fullness
information (PAG’sense’) ‘gate’ neurons in the pontine micturition center (PMC) to become activated to initiate
micturition behavior. Successful bladder filling and voiding is directed by PMC neurons that project to spinal cord
motoneurons that, in turn, innervate detrusor and urethral sphincter muscles. Our model predicts that activity in
PMC neurons is likely suppressed until the sensory (bladder distention) signal has been relayed/distributed (from
spinal cord-efferent PAG neurons) to brain regions that exert ‘executive control’ in determining whether a
situation is safe and socially acceptable for voiding. The proper function of both first-pass sensing neurons and
of these inputs, including those from the PAG, that exert inhibitory control over PMC neuron activity are critical
for maintaining continence. Guided by strong preliminary data, we will test our overarching hypothesis by
pursuing three specific aims: 1) identify and map axonal projections of sacral spinal cord-efferent
PAG/PAG’sense’ neurons; 2) using fiber photometry Ca2+ imaging, define neural activity in bladder-afferent-
activity recipient PAG/PAG’sense’ neurons that may function to transform the distention signal to PMC output
action, and determine how inhibitory PMC-afferent neurons, activate or deactivate to allow voiding; and 3) using
optogenetic stimulation define the circuit basis of inhibitory neural control over bladder function, including
identifying neurons that are necessary for maintaining continence. The approach is intellectually and technically
innovative because of its emphasis on sensory-signal-sensing PAG neurons and on inhibitory afferent inputs
(and source cell populations) that regulate PMC activity, and because it employs a novel combination of newly
developed and validated technical approaches. This work is significant because it is one of several key steps in
a continuum of research that is expected to lead to significant improvement of knowledge of our understanding
of the cellular and synaptic circuits that control bladder filling and voiding. Collectively these studies will inform a
far deeper and more detailed understanding of the circuitry regulating bladder function and hence has the very
real potential to inform the development of newer therapeutics for treating LUTS."

Nursing homes (NH) are a critical site of care for people with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias
(ADRD), particularly near the end of life. By 2030, an estimated 40% of all U.S. deaths will occur in NHs; 70%
of people with advanced dementia live their final days in a NH. Unfortunately, NH care is associated with
inadequate symptom control, low family satisfaction, burdensome treatments, and poor quality of care near the
end of life. Palliative care is a patient/family-centered model of care focused on maximizing quality of life and
relieving the suffering of people with serious illness. Despite growing recognition that palliative care is effective
for improving quality of life and quality of care and appropriate for NH residents with ADRD, there are a paucity
of sustainably-designed and tested models for NHs and palliative care practices to implement. We propose an
evidence-informed intervention that provides both internal capacity-building strategies for NHs, as well as
external specialty palliative care support, to impact the overall quality of care for residents with ADRD. The
objective of this proposal is to conduct a stepped wedge trial of the UPLIFT-AD (Utilizing Palliative Leaders In
Facilities to Transform care for Alzheimer's Disease) intervention. The UPLIFT-AD bundle includes 1) an in-
house palliative care champion who will receive training to facilitate advance care planning conversations with
residents with ADRD and their surrogate decision-makers, screen residents for palliative care needs and serve
as a liaison to external palliative care consultants; and 2) specialty palliative care consultant support providing
individual resident consults and staff education. Consistent with the goals of PAS-18-030, the UPLIFT-AD
intervention is designed to improve the quality of care and quality of life for persons with ADRD near the end of
life. In order to achieve this we will conduct a stepped wedge trial in partnership with two palliative care
practices and 16 NHs involving a projected 640 residents with dementia in two states with the following aims:
1) Compare quality of care of ADRD residents in intervention and control periods using the EOLD-CAD
instrument (primary trial outcome) which assesses symptom management and comfort, administered to both
family members and NH staff; compare family satisfaction with care at the end of life (EOLD-SWC) for ADRD
residents' families in intervention vs. control periods; 2) Evaluate the implementation of UPLIFT-AD using the
RE-AIM framework, including the proportion of eligible residents who receive palliative care assessments and
the degree of adoption of the intervention; 3) Compare staff knowledge/attitudes about palliative care, using
the Palliative Care Survey. If successful, the UPLIFT-AD bundle will serve as a much-needed, replicable
model for palliative care support for residents with ADRD and will be primed for rapid translation. In an
environment with increased incentives for health system and nursing facility integration, the UPLIFT-AD
bundle, with both internal capacity-building and external specialty support, will be a model for partnerships to
improve quality of care for residents with ADRD."

10824510,"PROJECT SUMMARY Clinical Phenotyping and Molecular Integration Core (Core B)
Our innovative application seeks to understand the how heterogeneity neutrophil populations in the lung impact
pneumonia and asthma development and outcomes by intersecting large scale clinical data collected during the
course of care for people with severe pneumonia with high-dimensional genomic, transcriptomic and functional
data. The overall goal of the Clinical Phenotyping and Molecular Integration (CPMI) Core is to curate patient
samples at participating sites and develop and implement strategies that support phenotypic and mechanistic
characterization of patient participants by integrating information from electronic health record (EHR) data, multi-
omics, spatial-transcriptomics and neutrophil functional studies. This core, which will sit at the heart of the Neu-
Lung project, will have sites at both Northwestern University (NU) and National Jewish (NJH), which will be
responsible for development of datasets for the pneumonia and asthma samples, respectively. While the NU
core will focus on a set of previously collected samples and associated clinical data, the team at NJ will collect
samples from asthma patients during the course of Neu-Lung. Both sites in the CPMI will then apply a similar
analysis pipeline 1) clean and curate clinical samples and data, 2) integrate clinical and molecular profiling data
for each patient and 3) apply effective machine learning strategies to develop models of neutrophil behavior in
the context of their lung disease focus area. The design of this core is based on the premise that data captured
during the course of clinical care that provides a thorough description of the patient and their environment are
essential for understanding the results of functional and multi-omic analyses and identifying clinically and
mechanistically relevant subpopulations of patients. Achieving the goals of this project will require tight
integration of clinical and molecular profiling data and the development of novel machine learning strategies that
can translate a complex set of multi-dimensional datasets into interpretable and actionable information to support
clinical care and mechanistic studies. In particular, we will leverage tailor- made algorithms for an integrative
analysis of multiple omics data sets with clinical that enable modeling of the underlying gene regulatory networks.
Datasets and metadata will be archived in the appropriate NIAID and/or NCBI archives and computational tools
will be made available for broader use through a GitHub repository. In addition, we will develop web-based tools
that will allow Neu-Lung researchers to interact with the study data repository and both browse and analyze the
collected data. Aim 1: Curate clinical samples and metadata from patients with severe pneumonia and lung
transplant recipients. Aim 2: Collect and curate clinical samples from patients with asthma. Aim 3: Implement a
data integration-analysis-modeling pipeline and web-based data analysis portal and disseminate data and code
developed during the Neu-Lung program."
10824511,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - Neutrophil Physiology Core
The Neutrophil Physiology Core provides critical services to both Projects 1 and 2. The multi-omics studies
provided by the other cores will provide valuable phenotyping information about our patients. The Neutrophil
Physiology Core will perform functional assays and provide quantitative data to show how their neutrophils
(PMN) are actually performing their roles in the innate immune response. Close communication with the PIs of
the two Projects will ensure that the appropriate assays are carried out for each patient sample depending on
the clinical context, especially in case of limited samples. PMN will be isolated from peripheral blood and
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples collected simultaneously from the enrolled patients. Isolated PMN will be
subjected to a number of assays to determine their ability to adhere to and move across physiologically relevant
substrates in response to appropriate inflammatory responses (adhesion to endothelial cells, adhesion to
respiratory epithelial cells, transendothelial migration, chemotaxis through extracellular matrix), engage in
appropriate effector function responses (phagocytosis of opsonized particles, phagocytosis and killing of bacteria
currently infecting the host, ROS generation, secretion of cytokines, release of granule content, generation of
regulatory extracellular vesicles (EVs) and production of antibacterial NETs), and to respond to infection and
tissue adaptation with relevant changes in metabolism (oxidative reactions, glycolysis, mitochondrial activation).
The core will also co-culture patient PMN with patient T cells and endothelial/epithelial cells in physiologic assays
to assess whether and how proper intercellular communication is impacted by disease. A parallel arm of the core
located at our site at National Jewish Hospital in Denver will carry out similar studies comparing blood, (BAL),
and unique sputum samples from their patients.
 To ensure rigor and reproducibility, endothelial cells are harvested regularly from human umbilical cords
and never used beyond passage two. This assures that phenomena are not unique to any particular endothelial
cell line. Endothelial cells are treated with the relevant cytokines and checked by flow cytometry and/or
immunofluorescence to verify that they are responding appropriately to each stimulus. Similarly, respiratory
epithelial cells are harvested from bronchial brushings and cultured in physiological air-liquid interface conditions
in early passages. Differentiation will be confirmed by detection of ciliation, mucus production and junctional
proteins using imaging approaches.
 The Core Leads and staff will meet weekly to discuss any issues that might arise regarding assay or
reagent reproducibility or workflow. They will meet more frequently should any problems arise. The Core PIs will
meet regularly with the PIs of the other cores and projects to review progress toward completion of the scientific

 3  The atomistic change of C(sp3)–H to C(sp3)–O, –N, or –C can profoundly impact the biological function and
 4  physical properties of small molecules. Traditionally, introducing these functionalities relies on functional group
 5  transformations from pre-oxidized carbon-heteroatom precursors. This approach limits the direct installation of new
 6  functionality into complex molecules, often necessitating de novo synthesis that is impractical for rapid exploration of
 7  biological function. Our proposal aims to provide selective C(sp3)–H functionalization reactions that install O, N and
 8  C in the hydrocarbon scaffold of complex molecules. This will enable late-stage functionalizations that expedite drug
 9  discovery processes, streamline total syntheses, and empower exploration of natural products as drug candidates.
10  Our group has shown that C(sp3)–H bonds in complex molecules can be distinguished based on their
11  electronic, steric, and stereoelectronic properties, resulting in a paradigm shift within the chemistry community that
12  prior to 2007 viewed aliphatic C–H bonds as preparatively indistinguishable. To do this, we have discovered and
13  commercialized iron and manganese PDP-based catalysts for C(sp3)–H oxidations; palladium(II)/sulfoxide catalysts
14  for allylic C–H functionalization; and manganese phthalocyanine catalysts for both intra- and intermolecular C(sp3)–
15  H aminations. These catalysts proceed with excellent levels of reactivity and selectivity in complex molecule settings,
16  without the need for directing groups. The late-stage functionalization approach that has emerged from this work has
17  been utilized in both industrial and academic settings. Building on this considerable foundation, we will undertake
18  major challenges required to broaden the application of late-stage functionalization in chemical synthesis and drug
19  discovery. We will innovate new base-metal complexes for aliphatic C–H oxidations that increase chemoselectivity
20  for tolerance of π-functionality and unprotected alcohols, as well as explore catalyst chiral recognition through non-
21  bonding interactions. These advances will make possible new reactions such as oxidative alkylations and catalyst-
22  controlled asymmetric induction and site-divergence. We will develop new base-metal complexes for intermolecular
23  C–H aminations and alkylations with unprecedented selectivities, and discover new ligand types amenable to
24  asymmetric induction. New palladium(II)/sulfoxide catalysts will be invented with an emphasis on introducing
25  functionality in complex settings. Cross-coupling reactions will be developed where O and N are introduced as part of
26  complex fragments. Additionally, asymmetric C–H functionalizations that feature catalyst-controlled
27  diastereoselectivities in substrates with pre-existing stereogenic centers will be advanced. Collectively, this program
28  will change the way synthetic chemists make and diversify complex molecules in pursuit of therapeutics, metabolites,
29  and biological probes."
10824343,"Project Summary
The goal of this project is to unravel molecular details of pharmacologically active sites in N-methyl-D-aspartate
receptors (NMDARs) with a scope to develop subtype-specific reagents against mental health-related disorders
and diseases including depression, psychosis, schizophrenia, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and stroke where
dysfunctional NMDARs are implicated. NMDARs belong to the ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) family which
mediates the majority of excitatory synaptic transmission in mammalian brains. They are hetero-multimeric
ligand-gated ion channels composed of GluN1 and GluN2 and/or GluN3 subunits. The GluN1 and GluN3
subunits bind co-agonists including glycine and D-serine, whereas the GluN2 subunits bind glutamate and NMDA.
Each NMDAR subunit contains an amino terminal domain (ATD), a ligand-binding domain (LBD), a
transmembrane domain (TMD), and a carboxyl terminal domain (CTD). The GluN1-GluN2 NMDARs open their
TMD ion channels upon binding of glycine and glutamate. NMDARs subtypes, defined by four distinct GluN2
subunits (A through D) or two distinct GluN3 (A and B) in combination with GluN1, exhibit different functional
properties and spatio-temporal expression patterns. In the previous grant cycles, we unraveled the fragment
structures of GluN1-2A and GluN1-2B ATDs, GluN1-2A and GluN1-2D LBDs, and intact structures of GluN1-2B
by utilizing x-ray crystallography and single-particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM). Our findings provided
molecular insights into channel assembly and basic patterns of conformational movements leading to activation,
inhibition, and allosteric regulation. Despite these advances, there are still many fundamental questions
remaining unanswered, including the completely unexplored structures of the GluN2C-containing NMDARs,
unknown/uncharacterized allosteric and channel blockade sites with clinical relevance, and novel regulation by
antibodies. We will now conduct research aimed at fulfilling these shortfalls. Aim 1 will determine the first
structure of GluN2C-containing NMDARs; Aim 2 will identify and characterize pharmacological sites of clinically
relevant compounds including ketamine, phencyclidine, memantine, and Glyx13. Aim 3 will unravel the
mechanism of binding and functional regulation by novel engineered antibodies, and the auto-immune antibody
for the first time. These three aims will be achieved by obtaining the structural information of intact NMDAR and
domain fragments in the presence and absence of reagents by utilizing x-ray crystallography and single-particle
cryo-EM. Structure-based mechanistic hypotheses will be examined mainly by electrophysiology. Successful
completion of the proposed research aims will provide a detailed understanding about NMDAR subtypes-
specificity, the regulatory mechanism by different reagents, and novel means to control NMDAR subtypes, which
will help develop therapeutic strategies for neurological disorders and diseases."
10824344,"Over 100 million Americans experience some forms of physical pain, a quarter of whom
struggle daily to cope with chronic and persistent pain conditions. One of the risks associated with
existing analgesic drugs, beyond some manageable side effects, is the potential for drug
dependence and abuse. Glycinergic inhibition plays a pivotal role in spinal nociception. Enhancing
glycine receptor (GlyR) activities by positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) has been recognized
as a promising alternative to opioids for treating chronic pain. By combining structural biology,
electrophysiology, and in vivo studies, we discovered a novel drug binding site in the human
GlyRs that mediates marijuana’s analgesic action independent of its psychoactive side effects.
We further discovered a new molecular scaffold that potentiates GlyRs with little cross reactivity
with opioid receptors and other psychotropic receptors. A lead drug candidate from this scaffold
was found to be specific positive allosteric modulators for α3-containing GlyRs and have higher
potencies than morphine in suppressing neuropathic and inflammatory pain in rodents. Using
RNAscope for in situ hybridization, we also discovered abundant colocalization of α3GlyR with a
special group of projection neurons in the midbrain. These intriguing findings led us to
hypothesize that α3GlyRs in the superficial layer of the spinal dorsal horn and in the midbrain
play a dual role as important targets for analgesia and as inhibitory regulators for the reward
circuits, respectively. We have collected ample preliminary data to support the following three
specific aims: Aim 1: Investigate the role of spinal α3GlyR as an effective molecular target to
alleviate mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in neuropathic and inflammatory pain; Aim 2:
Understand α3GlyR’s regulation of the midbrain projection neurons as a key cellular target for
antinociception and anti-psychomotor stimulation; and Aim 3: Elucidate the coupling of glycinergic
and dopaminergic signaling pathways to harness the dual action of selective positive allosteric
modulation of α3GlyRs for both analgesia and reduction of reward-seeking behavior, focusing on
drug-seeking and instrumental learning of self-administration tests. These mechanism-guided
investigations will complement and further enhance the discovery of new α3GlyR-targeting drugs
for safe and effective pain treatment."
10824356,"Project Summary
Functional localization of eloquent brain areas for patients undergoing surgery for brain tumors, epilepsy, or other
neurological diseases is crucial to prevent post-surgical deficits and reduce morbidity. Task-based (tb) functional
MRI (fMRI), which detects blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) signal changes while a patient performs
task paradigms, is a standard-of-care clinical procedure for presurgical mapping of eloquent cortices. Two major
limitations of clinical tb-fMRI are a patient's inability to perform the task and lesion-induced impairment of
neurovascular coupling (which drives the BOLD signal). Resting-state (rs) fMRI, which measures synchronized
BOLD signal oscillations during rest, can be used to map brain networks with minimal requirements for patient
compliance and has been demonstrated to accurately localize motor and language areas for presurgical planning.
Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) mapping, accessed by dynamic BOLD imaging during a hypercapnia task such
as breath-holding, can be used to identify areas with potential false-negative fMRI results due to neurovascular
uncoupling (NVU) and has been suggested as an emerging standard to be used with clinical fMRI. Currently,
there are no commercially available FDA-cleared software tools for localizing the resting-state networks (RSNs)
or CVR. Clinical investigators have relied on research software packages that are either not clinically integrated
or not yet optimized and validated in large patient populations. Thus, a vetted software solution is urgently
needed to enable these state-of-the-art fMRI methods to benefit patients beyond the limitations of tb-fMRI. We
hypothesize that enhancing, optimizing, and validating our preliminary software and integrating it with an
established commercial fMRI platform will create robust solutions for clinical mapping of RSN and CVR. Through
three specific aims, the software solutions will be optimized and tested with rs-fMRI and CVR datasets from
approximately 350 patients with brain tumors or epilepsy at three institutions. Aim 1 is to create the software for
mapping RSNs and determine optimized workflows for localizing eloquent areas including primary visual, motor
(hands, tongue, and feet), and language (primary and secondary) areas. Both seed-based correlation and
independent component analysis will be incorporated. Aim 2 is to create the software for mapping CVR and
determine the optimized workflow for identifying and visualizing brain areas with potential false-negative fMRI
results. The software will include a multiple-latency general linear model and a unique graphical user interface
to visualize the NVU. Aim 3 is to test and validate the software with presurgical fMRI datasets. The results will
be compared against those obtained from (1) processed using widely used research software packages, (2) tb-
fMRI, and (3) intraoperative direct cortical stimulation. This research is anticipated to create robust and clinically
available software that will greatly increase the patient population who can benefit from presurgical fMRI and will
improve confidence in functional localization for surgical planning. This will directly benefit patients by preserving
their post-surgical functions while allowing surgeons to safely maximize the resection of brain lesions."
10824357,"Chronic dysregulation of physiological systems manifests systemically as allostatic load (AL) and in abnormal
stress reactivity profiles, which are features of psychopathological conditions that increase future disease risk.
But the biological basis underlying inter-individual differences in stress regulation and reactivity remains
unknown. Even among populations of healthy individuals exposed to standardized laboratory challenges, such
as the Trier social stress test (TSST), there are substantial differences in the magnitude of responses in multiple
physiological systems, including but not limited to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the autonomic
nervous system (ANS) and cardiovascular system, metabolic changes, and immune and pro-inflammatory
systems. One common factor to all stress systems is their dependence on energy supply, which fuels every
aspect of the stress response including molecular, cellular, systemic and cognitive/psychological functioning. At
the cellular level, energy is provided by mitochondria, unique organelles that populate the cell cytoplasm and
contain their own genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), that is essential to mitochondrial health. MtDNA
defects cause dysregulation of multiple aspects of mitochondrial structure and function, known as mitochondrial
allostatic load (MAL). Three main lines of evidence suggest that MAL contributes to AL and regulates stress
responses in humans: i) we recently discovered that the mtDNA is released following psychological stress in
humans (PNEC 2019), ii) experimentally-induced MAL in animals caused specific alterations in the multisystem
physiological responses to psychological stress (PNAS 2015), and iii) mitochondria are the source of stress
hormones, including cortisol that is synthesized in mitochondria within the adrenal glands (Nat Genetics 2012).
Together, this evidence suggests that MAL may alter both baseline AL and stress reactivity profiles, potentially
providing new insight into the source of interindividual differences in stress regulation and health in general. In
this project, we perform the first comprehensive assessment of MAL, systemic AL, multisystem stress reactivity
to a laboratory challenge (TSST) in three groups of individuals who have rare genetic mtDNA defects that
selectively causes different forms of MAL and in a healthy control group. Multisystem stress biomarker profiling
under fasting baseline and stress reactive conditions will provide a comprehensive test of pathways linking MAL
to stress physiology in humans. The resulting high-dimensionality data will be treated using integrative data
analytic approaches and classifying algorithms, including cross-validated machine learning models, to identify
resting and stress-reactive biomarker signatures responsive to MAL. In parallel, assessments of executive
function and key domains of psychosocial functioning including mood, stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms,
and well-being will contribute to provide a comprehensive picture of novel mitochondrial psychobiological
pathways."
10825212,"ABSTRACT
Immunological memory is a fundamental feature of the adaptive immune system. However emerging evidence
demonstrates that the innate immune system can also display a form of adaptive, memory-like behavior, a
phenomenon termed “trained immunity.” Recently using single cell ATAC-seq we demonstrated that
immunization of humans with the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine stimulates persistent
epigenomic imprints in blood myeloid cells, that results in a heightened resistance to infection with
heterologous viruses Zika and Dengue viruses, and reduced chromatin accessibility of loci targeted by
the AP-1 transcription factors leading to reduced capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines. These
observations raise several key questions: 1) Do SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination stimulate functionally
distinct long-term epigenetic innate reprogramming? 2) Is epigenetic imprinting of innate immunity “tunable,” by
sequential infections or vaccinations? 3) What is the impact of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or infection on
epigenetic imprinting of innate immunity in tissues? 4) What are the mechanisms of innate memory induced by
vaccination and their effects on protection against heterologous pathogens?
These questions will be addressed in the following specific aims:
Aim 1. Perform a longitudinal analysis of the evolution of the innate response following sequential
rounds of SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination. We will perform a longitudinal analysis of the single cell
transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of the innate immune system using banked PBMCs collected before,
during and after infection from a COVID-19 cohort of healthcare workers and followed longitudinally from the
beginning of the pandemic, through every infection and vaccination.
Aim 2. Define the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape and function of myeloid cells in tissues. Most
studies have only examined epigenetic imprinting of innate immunity in the blood, and the effects in tissues
remain unclear. In sub-aim 2a we will assess the transcriptional and epigenomic landscape of myeloid-lineage
cells in human mucosal and lymphoid tissues obtained from organ donors. In sub-aim 2b, we will use banked
samples from completed studies in nonhuman primates to assess the transcriptional and epigenomic landscape
of innate immune cells in various tissues and blood following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination.
Aim 3: To assess the mechanisms of innate memory induced by vaccination and their effects on
protection against heterologous pathogens. In this aim we will use mice to explore the mechanisms
underlying innate memory to vaccination, and its functional consequences on protection against heterologous
infections."
10824580,"PROJECT ABSTRACT – PROJECT 2
SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A viruses are human pathogens with broad geographic range that cause pandemics
and jeopardize human health. While the rapid deployment of vaccines against COVID-19 and annual campaigns
with seasonally-matched inactivated, intramuscularly-delivered influenza vaccines have saved millions of human
lives, it has become increasingly apparent that intramuscularly-delivered vaccines do not effectively induce
mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract, which in theory, could better limit virus infection or transmission at the
portal of entry or egress. Although vaccination of antigen-naïve populations provides benefit against SARS-CoV-
2 infection, the impacts of intramuscular boosting on protection from infection by recent circulating strains has
been less impressive, in part due to the effects of immune imprinting. In Project 2 of this CCHI, we hypothesize
that viral infection in the context of prior recent vaccination induces mucosal immune responses that functionally
differ from those after infection or vaccination alone in the levels and types of cross-neutralizing and Fc effector
functions of antibodies (Abs), and cross-reactive T cell responses. Project 2 will address key knowledge gaps
as to the functional quality of infection- and vaccine-induced systemic and mucosal immunity. To achieve these
goals, we will utilize ongoing human natural history cohorts of infected and vaccinated adults with unique clinical
samples to study how vaccination impacts qualitative and quantitative systemic and mucosal antibody, B and T
cell responses, and Fc effector functions seen after SARS-CoV-2 or IAV infection. We also will utilize samples
from a unique influenza A virus human challenge cohort to assess how recent immunization with a quadrivalent
influenza vaccine (Flucelvax®) modulates induction of mucosal immunity and control of infection. Our innovative
studies on SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infection and vaccination will provide new information on human immune
responses and inform evaluation of new mucosal vaccines targeting the human respiratory tract."
10806575,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nano-sized secreted vesicles that carry biomolecules and mediate cell-cell
communication. EVs are implicated in the development and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) through
their role in spreading pathogenic proteins (i.e. amyloid-beta, Tau) through the brain. EVs also have utility as AD
biomarkers, given their ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and their presence in multiple bodily fluids.
Further, EVs are promising drug delivery vehicles, with the ability to target specific cell types. However, despite
their promise as biomarkers and therapeutics, EV biology remains poorly understood due to the lack of tools for
visualizing EVs in their physiological environments. Such tools will be essential for uncovering mechanisms of
EV spreading and uptake by different brain cell types, information critical for slowing AD progression and
harnessing EVs as AD therapeutics. In the current proposal, we will develop a pulse-labeling assay for tracking
cell type-specific EV secretion and spreading in the murine brain (Aim 1). We will then use this assay to examine
how APOE4 genotype, the strongest genetic risk factor for AD, impacts EV spreading in the dentate gyrus (Aim
2). The Halotag EV pulse-chase (HEVPL) assay will have the following three components: 1) EV-enriched
tetraspanin membrane proteins conjugated to the self-labeling Halotag, to enable in vivo pulse labeling with
fluorescent ligands that cross the BBB and covalently attach to Halotag; 2) AAV delivery coupled with cell type-
specific promoters/enhancers to express tetraspanin-Halotag proteins in specific brain cells; 3) coexpression of
tetraspanin-Halotags with GFP at equimolar concentration via the 2A cleavage sequence, allowing us to
distinguish GFP+ ‘donor’ cells that secrete tetraspanin-Halotag-containing EVs and GFP- ‘recipient’ cells that
internalize these EVs. The assay will be developed through in vitro and in vivo experiments to optimize
tetraspanin-Halotag expression and labeling, test the assay’s dynamic range, and determine the time course
over which labeled EVs can be detected in the brain. In Aim 2, we will use HEVPL to visualize the impact of the
APOE4 gene on EV secretion and spreading from granule cells of the dentate gyrus (DG). ApoE4 was recently
shown to compromise global EV secretion in aging humans and mice, but the specific cell types and brain regions
impacted remain unknown. The DG is one of the earliest brain regions affected in AD, and granule cells appear
to be particularly vulnerable to ApoE4-related pathology. Using the AAV-mscRE4 enhancer to drive CD63-
Halotag expression in granule cells, together with Halotag pulse-labeling and automated confocal microscopy/3D
image reconstruction, we will quantify and compare EV secretion and spreading over time for humanized APOE3
vs. APOE4 mice. These experiments will provide the first information about how ApoE4 impacts EV release and
spreading in an AD-vulnerable brain region, shedding light on a mechanism by which APOE4 genotype may
accelerate AD progression."
10806700,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 National data from several non-communicable diseases (NCD) risk factors surveillance surveys in
Vietnam have shown disturbing increases in the prevalence of HTN between 2010 and 2020 (16% vs. 28%) in
persons aged 25-64 years old. Both urban and rural populations showed significant increases in the prevalence
of HTN over time in these surveys, though urban (15% to 31%) populations demonstrated greater negative
trends compared to rural (16% to 27%) communities. This can be attributed to increasing adverse lifestyle
practices, including unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol consumption, and high levels of stress.
Urban residents were more likely to have important NCD comorbidities and reported having less time to manage
their HTN. The need for a large-scale and sustainable intervention approach for HTN control is emphasized in
the 2022-2025 national strategic plan of Vietnam. In our recently completed NIH-funded study, we developed a
multi-level, integrated approach for controlling HTN and successfully deployed it in rural northern Vietnam.
Preliminary results showed that our intervention is well-accepted and effective. We now propose to adapt this
work tailored to an urban Vietnamese setting using innovative implementation strategies to enhance intervention
delivery (mHealth platform and Integrated Health Care Delivery System). Our intervention adaptation process
will be guided by ADAPT-ITT model. Implementation and evaluation of the study will be guided by the EPIS
(Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment) framework. The HTN-URBAN intervention includes
three integrated components: (1) a storytelling intervention; (2) home BP self-monitoring; and (3) expanded
community health worker services.
 Our specific aims for the R61 phase are to: 1) conduct an HTN Needs Assessment (30 semi-structured
interviews) in Hai Phong city; 2) develop and refine HTN-URBAN based on the results of our HTN Needs
Assessment and the ADAPT-ITT model for adapting a proven intervention to a new setting and condition. Our
specific aims for the R33 phase are to 3) implement a cluster randomized type II Hybrid Effectiveness and
Implementation trial in 14 communities in Hai Phong, including 700 patients with uncontrolled HTN, randomized
to an intervention (HTN-URBAN of three integrated components) or comparison group (“Learn More” module -
didactic material only without stories) to assess the primary clinical effectiveness outcome (changes in BP) and
implementation outcomes including intervention acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, adoption, and fidelity;
4) prepare for dissemination of HTN-URBAN by integration with the National Strategy on Prevention and Control
for Non-Communicable Diseases and building capacity in policy-relevant Implementation Science. This project
will address gaps in hypertension (HTN) control for adults living in urban setting in Vietnam by testing a multi-
level, evidence-based intervention with the promise of nationwide scalability and sustainability."
10806716,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypertension is the leading modifiable cardiovascular (CVD) risk factor, affecting 1 in 4 adults worldwide, of which
2/3rd live in low- and middle-income countries. Despite the availability of effective interventions, 46% of adults with
hypertension are undiagnosed; and only 1 in 5 who are aware of their diagnosis are adequately managed. South
Asia has one of the highest prevalence of hypertension in the world, and only less than 10% adults with
hypertension achieve blood pressure control. Patients living in urban areas at particular high risk of complications
of hypertension due to a variety of reasons including complex urban health system, loose social cohesion, stress
and limited access to physical activity and healthy food and increased exposure to pollutants. We propose a
multimodal intervention that leverages telehealth and community health workers to connect patients with severe
hypertension to primary care resources and coach them using evidence-based, practical lifestyle solutions relevant
to urban living. We call the intervention Coaching and Navigation by CHW through Telehealth for High-risk
Hypertension or CONNECT-HTN. We have three specific aims. We will first iteratively refine and finalize the
protocol for implementing the CONNECT-HTN, including establishing community and stakeholder engagement to
ensure the sustainability of this approach. We will then determine whether the use of CONNECT-HTN is effective
in reducing the rate of death and hospital admissions due to heart disease or stroke and compare it to referral to
clinic-based care. In parallel we will evaluate the implementation of our intervention using a convergent, mixed
methods study design and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Our expectation is
that CONNECT HTN will add to the evidential basis for implementing many of the WHO Best Buys for Non-
Communicable Disease (NCD) prevention and control and will be the first study powered to measure substantive
mortality and mortality outcomes in LMICs"
10809804,"Ultrasound (US) neuromodulation (NM) utilizes mechanical energy from sound to modulate the physiology of excitable cells through mechanosensitive ion channels (MSIC). Its uninvasive bone-penetrating nature combined with a unique focusing capability provides advantages over optogenetics and chemogenetics. Recently, the FDA has approved transcranial USNM. There is a lack of a molecular understanding on how US modulates cellular excitability. Furthermore, not all cells express channels that respond to US. To address these issues, novel experimental systems and techniques will be implemented to extract mechanistic biophysical information and engineer sonogenetic tools for robust transgenic expression. The biophysical effects of US on TRAAK K+ channels were recently characterized because of its potential to serve as a sonogenetic silencer of neurons. The endogenous expression of TRAAK at the nodes of Ranvier also makes it an attractive candidate for inhibitory NM when targeting native myelinated axons in the white matter. During the mentored phase (Aim 1, K99), the fundamental biophysical effects of US will continue to be characterized on TRAAK and other channels. This includes experiments to calculate tension and surveying optimal US parameters to maximize channel stimulation. Preliminary data suggests that the CFTR Cl- channel is sensitive to US. Other MSIC will also be screened to identify those sensitive to US. The next aim (Aim 2, K99/R00) looks to optimize TRAAK and other MSIC into sonogenetic tools. To transform TRAAK into a US-hypersensitive action potential generator, structure guided mutagenesis will be used to increase its sensitivity to ultrasound and permeability to Na+. Aim 3 (R00 phase) looks to implement NM by stimulating endogenous MSIC and transgenically expressed sonogenetic tools. They will be activated in vitro in mouse brain slices and cultured neurons, and in vivo in live mice. In summary, this proposal looks to screen for and optimize the activation of endogenous MSIC with US, and also engineer novel sonogenetic tools. In a short period of time, this work will advance our understanding of the effects of US on MSIC and NM. The long-term goal is to implement these tools for clinical use in minimally invasive NM. This research program will generate a platform of complementary techniques and applicable knowledge that can also be applied by others for further studies in sonogenetics and USNM. Dr. Sorum's mentors, Profs. Brohawn and Adesnik, have expertise that spans many areas of neuroscience including mechanobiology, MSIC structure/function, optogenetics, NM, neural circuits, and behavior. Two additional years of training will allow him to fully develop skills in molecular, cellular and systems neuroscience and merge them with USNM and sonogenetics."
10797579,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Amoxicillin is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as adjunctive therapy for the treatment
of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM). Because children with uncomplicated SAM may have
asymptomatic infection due to immune suppression, presumptive treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic
may be beneficial by clearing any existing infection and improving outcomes. Two randomized placebo-
controlled randomized trials have evaluated amoxicillin for uncomplicated SAM and have found conflicting
results. These results may indicate either that antibiotics are not helpful for the management of uncomplicated
SAM, or that a better antibiotic is needed. Recently, we demonstrated that biannual mass azithromycin
distribution as a single oral dose reduces all-cause child mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Children with
uncomplicated SAM, who have an elevated risk of mortality relative to their well-nourished peers, may
particularly benefit from presumptive azithromycin treatment. Our pilot data demonstrated feasibility in rapid
enrollment of children with uncomplicated SAM in our study area, and showed no significant difference
between azithromycin and amoxicillin, demonstrating equipoise for a full-scale trial. Here, we propose an
individually randomized trial in which children will be randomized to a) azithromycin, b) amoxicillin, or c)
placebo, and evaluated for differences in weight gain, nutritional recovery, and the gut microbiome. The results
of this study will strengthen the evidence base for policy related to the use of antibiotics as part of the
management of uncomplicated SAM, including additional evidence of amoxicillin versus placebo as well as
evaluation of an antibiotic class that has not been considered for uncomplicated SAM, which may lead to
changes in guidelines for treatment."

Translational Viral Oncology (CTVO) during its Phase 2 operation by providing the overall 
planning and coordination of the mentoring and research for the selected group of Junior Principle 
Investigators (PJIs). The AC will be responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the 
Center, organizing advisory committee meetings, facilitating JPIs privileged access to research 
core facilities, evaluating new pilots and research projects, and promoting interdisciplinary 
interactions. This will ensure an appropriate career development for JPIs who have a strong 
interest in utilizing their most important research findings for the development of new preventive 
and/or therapeutic modalities against virus-associated cancers. There are three major factors 
which make the CTVO highly competitive and unique: 1) Access to a unique minority patient 
population that is disproportionally affected by virus-induced cancers; 2) Experienced basic 
research and clinical scientists who are dedicated to the study of viral cancers and are highly 
motivated to serve as mentors and advisors in CTVO; and 3) State-of-the-art Research Core 
Facilities. The AC is designed specifically to facilitate each of these crucial components through 
the following specific aims: Aim 1: Provide scientific leadership and administrative structure for 
coordinating thematic research on viruses and cancer across participating institutions, including 
peer review from internal and external advisors, and for integration of CTVO with other programs 
dedicated to research, patient care, teaching, and community engagement. Aim 2: Support the 
development of highly competitive Principal Junior Investigators (JPIs) through mentoring and 
career development plans within the CTVO and their Academic Departments. Aim 3: Promote 
the development, sustainability, and effective utilization of research core facilities, novel scientific 
techniques and resources while instilling an awareness and sensitivity to gender, economic and 
ethnic inclusiveness, and equity in all activities. The participating institutions include Louisiana 
State University Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC), New Orleans; LSUHSC, Baton Rouge; 
LSUHSC, Shreveport; and Tulane University Medical Center (TUMC), which are responsible for 
the majority of patient care, research, and scientific training in the region. These institutions 
support state-of-the-art core facilities, tumor registries, electronic medical records, clinical trial

selected outstanding basic research and clinical mentors to create this highly motivating and 
competitive research environment for COBRE-supported JPI candidates."
11014837,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is the most lethal and aggressive type of breast cancer, with limited
therapeutic options. Racial/ethnic disparities have been well documented in patients with IBC. IBC is found in a
higher proportion of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) women with breast cancer, and their
prognosis is poorer than other racial/ethnic populations in Hawaii. Given IBC's aggressiveness and its limited
treatment options, there is a critical need to examine the underlying biological mechanisms contributing to the
disparities in risks and outcomes for NHPI women with IBC, and to identify molecular targets to improve their
treatment options. In this project supplement, we will extend our R01-funded investigations of IBC-relevant
mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME), by characterizing the molecular profiles of IBC tumors from
NHPI, Asian American and White IBC patients. We propose 2 aims: Aim 1: Characterize the transcriptomic
profiles of IBC tumors from NHPI, Asian American, and White patients to examine for differences in
tumor biology across the populations. We hypothesize that there are underlying differences in the tumor
biology in IBC tumors from NHPI that are associated with the observed disparate risk and outcome for NHPI
IBC patients when compared to Asian American and White IBC patients. To test our hypothesis, we will
perform RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for IBC patient tumor samples from The Hawaii Tumor Registry Residual
Tissue Repository with a focus on tumors from NHPI, Asian American, and White patients. We will examine for
differences in gene expression profiles between NHPI and non-NHPI (Asian American and White) IBC
patients. Aim 2: Characterize the immune tumor microenvironment profiles of IBC tumors from NHPI,
Asian American, and White patients to examine for differences across the populations. We hypothesize
that there are immunological differences in TME of IBC tumors from NHPI patients when compared to IBC
tumors from Asian American and White patients. We will conduct multiplexed immunofluorescence staining
(mIF) to assess the immune cell composition and the spatial distribution in tissues from NHPI, Asian American,
and White patients. We will use the immunological profiles to examine the differences in the tumor immune
microenvironment of IBC tumors between NHPI and non-NHPI (Asian American and White) IBC patients. Upon
completion, we expect to characterize racial/ethnic differences in the transcriptomic and immune
microenvironment landscape of IBC patients. We also expect to determine the expression of key molecules
and TME components identified in the parent R01, and how they differ in these three-specific racial/ethnic
cohorts of IBC patients. If successful, our supplement will provide insights to identify molecules and TME
components associated with the aggressiveness of IBC. They could lead to the identification of therapeutic
targets for IBC patients from specific racial or ethnic backgrounds."
10799131,"Lung cancer is the primary cause of cancer death in western countries, including the United States.
Kentucky leads the nation both in lung cancer incidence and mortality. Lung cancer-related mortality is mainly
due to metastasis. During metastasis, malignant tumors accumulate collagen fibrils to drive cancer cell
dissemination and impede the influx of anti-tumor immune cells. The long-term goal of our laboratory is to
determine the roles of collagen and collagen-modifying enzymes in metastasis to inform new therapeutic
development. Toward that goal, we found that the collagen lysyl hydroxylase 2’s long alternatively spliced
isoform b (LH2b), carrying an extra motif encoded by exon 13a, is a previously undetected collagen
glucosyltransferase (GGT). GGT plays a major role in LH2’s pro-metastatic activity. High expression levels of
LH2b predict a worse prognosis, while the expression levels of LH2’s short alternatively spliced isoform a
(LH2a) without exon 13a are not prognostic. These findings provide a novel basis for the observation made by
our group and many others that high LH2 expression has poor-prognostic value and drives the growth and
metastasis of multiple cancer types, including lung cancer, breast cancer, and sarcoma. Thus, LH2 GGT is a
new therapeutic target of interest. However, how LH2 GGT drives cancer metastasis is unclear and LH2 GGT
inhibitor is not available, deficiencies that can be addressed only by gaining mechanistic insight into the
structure-function of LH2 GGT.
 To elucidate how LH2 GGT enzymatic activity is structurally regulated, we solved 3 collagen GGT
structures, including LH2 GGT and its mimiviral homolog. Our results suggested that LH2b forms a dimer with
a continuous collagen-binding site and binds UDP-glucose cooperatively. Based on these findings, we
hypothesized that LH2b’s unique structural features allow it to modify tumor stroma and drive metastasis. By
testing this hypothesis, we will gain insights into 1) to what extent LH2b overexpression and LH2b-mediated
collagen glucosylation happen in human lung cancer; 2) why LH2b drives tumor progression; 3) how LH2b
GGT function is regulated; 4) what are LH2b GGT’s pro-metastatic structural features. The findings from this
work will advance the understanding of the relevance and mechanism of LH2b in tumor progression and
identify the structural features of LH2b GGT that drive cancer progression. Such insights will inform LH2b GGT
cancer biology and inhibitor development."
10799134,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Persistent human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is responsible for over 30,000 new cases of cancer annually
in the United States (US). HPV infection can be prevented by immunization, but 12 years after being
recommended for use, HPV immunization rates among US adolescents remain suboptimal. While uptake of
other vaccines recommended for 11-12 year-olds is at or near 90%, only 43% of adolescent boys and girls are
up-to-date for HPV vaccination. Prior efforts to improve HPV vaccine uptake have followed standard best
practices for immunization programs, including education provision for parents and adolescent patients, and
Health Belief Model-inspired appeals to disease severity. One key barrier to improving HPV vaccine uptake is
that healthcare providers often do not recommend this vaccine with the same strength as they do for other
adolescent vaccines. Continued low uptake of HPV vaccine indicates that new systems-level approaches,
beyond standard public health education campaigns, are needed. These systems-level approaches –
incorporating the healthcare practice and provider as well as the patient - must be designed and packaged in a
way to address the quality of, and context around, provider recommendations.
Our research team has developed and pilot-tested an intervention package – TweenVax – designed to improve
HPV vaccine uptake at the practice-, provider-, and patient/parent-level. Evaluation of TweenVax identified key
elements for expansion to improve the provision and strength of provider recommendations. Gaps remain in
terms of how best to address missing or substandard provider recommendations, including addressing
moment-to-moment patient and data flow and various points of intervention during the clinic visit including desk
check-in through clinical examination and vaccination and follow-up appointment scheduling. Enhancements to
the TweenVax intervention will include improvements in practice-level communication in the context of patient
flow and additional training for non-clinical staff, development of enhanced training modules for clinical staff,
including interactive experiential training and provision of continuing education credits, and updates to the
content and presentation of the TweenVax tablet- and web-based educational program.
The proposed multi-phase study will 1) assess, using ethnographic observations and in-depth interviews, both
best practices and deficiencies in all clinical aspects of the adolescent healthcare encounter, with findings used
to refine existing intervention tools to improve HPV vaccination of 9-12 year-olds; and 2) evaluate the efficacy
of our comprehensive intervention in improving HPV vaccine uptake among 9-12 year-old girls and boys in
Georgia and Tennessee. This assessment, through a three-arm trial, will provide the opportunity to assess the
efficacy of the intervention package as a whole, as well as to determine the efficacy of individual components
(e.g. practice-/provider-level components independent of patient/parent-level components)."
10798756,"Oxidative stress is a hallmark of neurodegeneration and has been implicated in the pathobiology of vascular
contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). Our “chemogenetic” approach allows us to
dynamically modulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in target cells in vivo using the yeast enzyme D-amino
acid oxidase (DAAO) to produce the ROS hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). We generated two new transgenic mouse
lines that express DAAO by crossing a conditionally activatable DAAO transgenic mouse line (which we
developed) with commercially available mouse lines expressing Cre recombinase under control of two distinct
putatively “endothelial cell-specific” Cdh5 or Tie2 promoters. Both the DAAO-TGCdh5 and DAAO-TGTie2 lines
express DAAO and generate H2O2 in endothelial cells. Within 2 days of providing D-alanine to DAAO-TGCdh5
mice, the animals develop a striking sensory ataxia, and have a highly specific pattern of neurodegeneration and
mitochondrial disarray in dorsal root ganglia and nodose (vagal sensory) ganglia. Importantly, DAAO-TGCdh5
mice treated with D-alanine also develop cardiac hypertrophy. The combination of sensory neuropathy and
cardiac hypertrophy is similar to the phenotype of Friedreich’s ataxia, the most common form of hereditary ataxia
in humans. By contrast, the DAAO-TGTie2 transgenic line, which expresses DAAO in endothelium under control
of the Tie2 promoter, shows no ataxia, has no transgene expression in DRG, and does not develop cardiac
hypertrophy. But the DAAO-TGTie2 mice does develop marked disruption of the blood barrier following long-term
D-alanine feeding. Here we propose studies to test the hypotheses that neurovascular oxidative stress leads to
neurodegeneration, BBB disruption, cognitive dysfunction, and cardiac hypertrophy. We propose to pursue
transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and biochemical studies of DRG, nodose ganglia, brain, and cardiac
tissues following chemogenetic oxidative stress in vivo, and we will study the behavioral and physiological
phenotypes in the DAAO-TGCdh5 and DAAO-TGTie2 mouse lines. We will identify the temporal sequence and the
molecular mechanisms whereby neurovascular oxidative stress causes degeneration of DRG and nodose
ganglia and leads to cardiac hypertrophy. We will establish the pathways by which vascular oxidative stress
disrupts the BBB and leads to cognitive impairment. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: Identify the molecular
mechanisms whereby neurovascular oxidative stress causes degeneration of DRG; Aim 2: Characterize the
molecular processes whereby neurovascular oxidative stress causes disruption of the blood-brain barrier and
leads to cognitive impairment; Aim 3: Define the pathways whereby neurovascular oxidative stress causes
cardiac hypertrophy. The proposed studies may lead to the identification of new pharmacological targets for
prevention and treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias, Friedreich’s ataxia, adverse cardiac
remodeling, and the many other chronic disease states in which oxidative stress has been implicated."

 Approximately 700,000 pancreatic cysts are incidentally detected by imaging each year. Up to 70% of
these radiologically-detected cysts are intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), bona fide precursor
lesions to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a malignancy with a 5-year relative survival rate of
only 12%. The goal of our parent grant is to fulfill the unmet need to discover a noninvasive biomarker and
imaging approach that has greater accuracy in predicting IPMN pathology than conventional radiologic and
clinical features, thereby enhancing clinical decision-making and promoting more good than harm for patients at-
risk to harbor or develop early PDAC. Our central hypothesis is that radiomic features extracted from
preoperative CT scans will more accurately predict IPMN pathology than conventional radiologic features, both
individually and in combination with a plasma-based miRNA genomic classifier (MGC). We further hypothesize
that the most promising radiomic features may serve as noninvasive surrogates for underlying biological
processes (which are miRNA-mediated and/or linked to mucin expression) that drive IPMN development and
progression to invasion. In the two-year extension period, we plan to continue to address this goal and
hypothesis by applying new artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches and incorporating additional classes of
biomarkers (blood-based and behavioral). We aim to: evaluate the value of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven CT
deep learning radiomic features in predicting malignant versus benign IPMN pathology in retrospective and
prospective cohorts (Aim 1), evaluate telomere length and telomerase activity in the blood as candidate
molecular markers of high-grade IPMNs or early-stage PDAC (Aim 2), and use behavioral AI to predict malignant
transformation among patients with a high risk to develop PDAC (Aim 3). This line of translational research has
potential to foster clinically actionable information that could be used to rapidly and cost-effectively personalize
care for individuals with IPMNs and ultimately reduce the burden of PDAC as a major health problem, a goal
in line with the parent award and with NCI’s mission to lead, conduct, and support cancer research across the
nation to advance scientific knowledge and help all people live longer, healthier lives."

Osteopenic fragility fractures are a devastating result of poor bone quality secondary to high mortality and long-
term patient disability. Currently there is limited understanding on the mechanistic level reflected in the relatively
few available treatment and diagnostic options. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is utilized in
combination with established patient standards for diagnosis and management of osteoporosis, however its use
is limited in patients. There is a clear need to improve technologies that enable bone quality measurements,
especially to avoid refracture.
In the proposed work we will develop technology that enables chronic insight into bone health for rodent animal
models to enable real-time high-fidelity readout enabling advanced insight for the study of mechanisms and to
evaluate the efficacy of new treatments. Specifically, we will build on our recently introduced device class,
osseosurface electronics, which are battery free and fully implantable bone strain monitors.
In aim 1 we will evaluate permanent interfacing and sensing capabilities of the platform that is grown to the bone
via calcium phosphate ceramic particles on month long timescales. Data captured from daily exercise on a
treadmill will enable insight in sensing fidelity and will be compared against gait parameters automatically
captured by deep neural net image analysis. In aim 2 we will develop a new sensing modality, thermal
conductivity measurements, that will be validated by the attachment of the biointerface to the bone, a mechanism
we already characterized with strain sensors. This platform will then be used to compare the sensitivity of serial
DEXA, µCT, in vivo strain and thermal conductivity measurement in detecting bone changes following
administration of an anabolic medication used to treat osteoporosis in aim 3. Ovariectomy animal models with
and without treatment will be evaluated by osseosurface electronics against DEXA and µCT.
Successful expansion of our osseosurface electronic platform will enable new real time and high-fidelity
measurement of bone health in freely moving small animal models. This capability is instrumental to explore
mechanisms of chronic and acute changes attributed to fracture or disease in models that have the full genetic
toolset and enable rapid test of hypothesis with little cost. The experiments will also inform the utility of the
devices towards the use in patients for chronic treatment of osteoporosis."

Bone fractures occur in 50% of the population causing significant morbidity and mortality and costing more than
$20 billion annually. Advanced age diminishes bone repair capacity and is associated with increased surgical
intervention at the time of the injury and subsequently with the need for revisions. The development of therapies
aimed at enhancing bone repair would significantly reduce the burden on the geriatric population. We recently
identified Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) to be an age-associated inhibitor of fracture repair. ApoE is a circulatory
protein and increases in abundance with age in mice and in humans. In our published work, circulating ApoE
inhibited osteoblast differentiation and activity decreasing the amount of bone deposited within the fracture
callus. The liver produces >90% of the ApoE found in circulation, as such, we delivered siRNA against ApoE
using an AAV targeting hepatocytes in aged mice. Circulating levels of ApoE were dramatically decreased and
subsequent aged bone healing was greatly improved. This finding serves as a ‘proof of concept’ that ApoE is a
viable target to improve aged fracture repair. Within this proposal we will build on these findings identifying
interventions that can be translated to clinic to improve aged bone healing. In Aim 1 we will determine whether
neutralizing circulating ApoE improves aged fracture healing. We have developed an ApoE-neutralizing antibody.
A small cohort of aged male mice underwent fracture injury and were later treated with this antibody IP. Versus
IgG-treated mice, the calluses of anti-ApoE treated mice contained higher amounts of bone tissue. In this aim
we will identify the optimal regimen and dose of antibody to use and determine how this treatment changes the
stages of fracture repair. Furthermore, we have identified ApoE-based inhibition to propagate through
osteoblastic muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), a cell-surface tyrosine kinase receptor whose osteogenic
expression and function has yet to be reported in the literature. In Aim 2 we will we will use MuSK floxed mice
crossed with inducible Cre-recombinase mice to identify the role of osteogenic progenitor and osteoblastic MuSK
in bone repair. In Aim 3 we will identify the mechanism by which ApoE decreases osteoblast differentiation.
Using in vitro cell culture techniques, we have identified the Yap/Taz pathway to be modulated with ApoE
treatment. An osteoblastic cell-surface receptor for this pathway has yet to be identified. We have determined
MuSK to potentially serve as such a receptor. Using transgenic mouse models, we will determine functionality
of MuSK in osteoblast biology and investigate the role of MuSK in ApoE-based osteoblast inhibition/signal
transduction."

Every year over 1 million American adults and children develop overwhelming infection leading to a rotting of
their body we call ‘sepsis’, and death in up to 1 of 4 afflicted. We and others have asked the question “why do
patients continue to die of organ shutdown?” In the previous funding period we used clinical information and
samples already obtained in our R01 funded audit of 401 children with sepsis and took advantage of the
wonderful advances made this millenia in computer technology, big data, bioinformatics, and the study of
human and virus genetics to understand how too much inflammation and too little immune response lead to
organ shutdown. First, we used ‘Watson’ like machine learning at 24 hours to identify a sub-group of children
we named PedSep-D who subsequently go on to death with organ shutdown caused by too much inflammation
and clotting that we can now reverse with anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic therapies. Second, we used
an ‘Ancestry.com’-like or ‘23 and me’-like next generation sequencing approach to identify genes in individual
children that were related to too much inflammation and too little ability to kill infection which we can now treat
on an individual basis using ‘precision medicine’ therapies. Third, we used molecular biology testing
approaches to identify Latent Epstein Barr Virus infection as an asymptomatic preexisting high- risk condition
that is associated with death when children develop sepsis.
Disordered inflammation and immunity are closely related to altered metabolism. We previously linked all
three to organ shutdown and death in pediatric sepsis. In the next funding period we will investigate toxic
‘metabolism’ as a cause of organ shutdown by measuring plasma metabolomics in these same 401 child
samples. In Specific Aim 1 we test the hypothesis that PedSep D patients have a shift to aerobic glycolysis
that drives toxic macrophage activation that can potentially be reversed with glucose restriction and / or
Metformin treatment. In Specific Aim 2 we test the hypothesis that gene variants related to Inborn Errors of
Metabolism contribute to organ shutdown that can be reversed using established Precision Medicine metabolic
therapies. In Specific Aim 3 we test the hypothesis that Epstein Barr Virus latent infection is causally
associated with organ shutdown because it induces Immuno-Metabolic reprogramming of the host response in
sepsis towards aerobic glycolysis that is potentially reversed with repurposed drugs such as Metformin. We
also examine methylation epigenetics in these children to begin to understand the molecular basis for this host
pathogen response. Our long-term objective is to plan ‘precision’ medicine and ‘individualized’ medicine
clinical trials testing therapies that address Inflammation-Immune-Metabolism dysregulation on an individual
patient basis in order to further reduce death from sepsis induced organ shutdown in children."

Approximately 500,000 children suffer critical illness every year in the United States and more than one third
will receive a continuous infusion of a sedative-analgesic medication such as an opioid or dexmedetomidine.
Such drugs are commonly administered to ease the burden of critical illness by treating serious pain and
anxiety associated with invasive organ support delivery and procedures in the intensive care unit. However,
there are no widely-accepted standards for the administration of these potent neuroactive medications and
several studies have demonstrated that children receive too little or too much of these medications nearly half
of the time they are administered. This imprecision in conventional dosing strategies leads to adverse events,
including acute physiologic deterioration, drug tolerance and dependency, prolonged illness and hospitalization
and life-threatening complications of invasive support such as unplanned extubation and post-extubation
airway obstruction. Evidence also indicates that relatively short exposures to these medications may be
detrimental to long-term neurodevelopment. More precise strategies for administering these medications to
children are needed and this is an issue of major"
10802193,"Defects in motor neuron (MN) function or survival result in severe human pathologies, such as amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy, with distinct MN subtypes differing in their susceptibility to
disease. There is currently no effective treatment for these disorders, in part due to a lack of understanding
of the molecular mechanisms that allow distinct MN subtypes to acquire and maintain their function-defining
properties. The continuous expression, from development through adulthood, of subtype-specific terminal
identity genes (e.g., genes coding for ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, neuropeptides, signaling
molecules) defines the unique, functional features of a given MN subtype throughout life. How these genes
are induced and maintained is poorly understood. This proposal uses a novel approach to specifically focus
on the transcriptional regulation of MN subtype-specific terminal identity genes.
 The goal of this proposal is to uncover conserved, gene regulatory mechanisms that establish during
development, and maintain throughout life, the expression of MN subtype-specific terminal features. To this
end, this proposal combines the strengths of two model organisms: the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans
and mouse Mus musculus. By studying how C. elegans ventral nerve cord (VNC) MNs acquire their
subtype-specific features, we discovered a gene regulatory mechanism that involves the intersectional
activity of highly conserved transcription factors. We found that the transcription factor UNC-3 induces and
maintains the expression of terminal identity genes in all VNC MN subtypes. However, UNC-3 does not act
alone. It requires co-factors in the form of Hox proteins that act synergistically with UNC-3 to activate
expression of terminal identity genes in distinct MN subtypes along the anterior-posterior axis of the VNC.
We observed Hox expression in developing and adult MNs, suggesting that Hox proteins, similar to UNC-3,
not only induce, but also maintain expression of terminal identity genes. The unpublished data in this
application indicate that Hox proteins, in mice, also control expression of terminal identity genes in spinal
MNs, suggesting evolutionary conservation of our C. elegans findings. This proposal aims to uncover the
function of Hox proteins in adult C. elegans MNs (Aim 1), decipher the gene regulatory mechanisms
downstream of Hox in C. elegans MNs (Aim 2), and test the hypothesis that a mouse Hox protein (Hoxc8),
similar to its C. elegans orthologs, is required to induce and maintain expression of terminal identity genes
in MNs of the brachial spinal cord (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed activities will advance our
understanding of how distinct MN subtypes become and remain functional, which may provide new insights
into the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of MN disorders."

 Tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMCs), which consist of tumor associated macrophages and myeloid-
derived suppressor cells, make up a majority of cellular infiltrates in glioma. TAMCs are potently
immunosuppressive, and represent a major barrier to successful immunotherapy. TAMCs highly express
arginase-1 (Arg-1), a catabolic enzyme thought to deplete arginine from the tumor microenvironment. Despite
being a well-known marker of immunosuppressive cells, the metabolic reasons for this choice are not clear.
 Examination of TAMCs phenotype in murine glioma models using RNA-seq, bulk metabolomics, and
carbon-13 arginine flux revealed that two separate pathways of arginine catabolism converge on the generation
of ornithine. Ornithine is the prerequisite substrate for the de-novo generation of polyamines, a group of nitrogen-
rich metabolites with foundational importance to all domains of biology. Importantly, we found that the rate-
limiting step of polyamine generation, ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1), is dramatically upregulated by glioma
infiltrating TAMCS, suggesting de-novo polyamine generation is important for their function. Therefore, the
overall goal of this proposal is to determine how arginine is catabolized into polyamines by TAMCs, and to
determine if inhibition of this metabolic pathway can enhance immunotherapy for glioma.
 Interestingly, we discovered that a second, unstudied metabolic pathway of arginine metabolism, the de-
novo generation of creatine from ornithine, is preferentially utilized by TAMCs in our glioma models. The first aim
of this project is to generate genetically engineered mice (GEM) to determine the role of the de-novo creatine
metabolism in generating immunosuppression in mouse models of glioblastoma. This aim will dissect if creatine
generation is used as a fuel to survive in brain tumors, or is being used to promote immunosuppression.
 Our preliminary experiments suggest that inhibition of the products of arginine metabolism, polyamines,
can perturb TAMC immune suppression. This suggests that polyamines may be critical metabolites for the
functions of TAMCs in brain tumors. Therefore, the second aim of this proposal is to probe the importance of
polyamine metabolism by TAMCs in glioma. We will generate unique conditional knockout animal models to
probe the importance of this pathway in the immunosuppressive functions of TAMCs in glioma.
 The third aim of this project is to determine if targeting of these pathways can be combined with standard
of care for glioma to promote animal survival. First, we will test if a blood-brain-barrier permeable inhibitor of
creatine kinase can be used to stymie TAMCs in glioma. Next, we will use well established inhibitors of polyamine
generation and polyamine uptake in attempts to blunt TAMC mediated immunosuppression in glioma. Lastly, we
will take the clinical inhibitors described above, and determine if they can be used to potentiate checkpoint
immunotherapy for glioma."

Multiple chromodomain-helicase-DNA-binding (CHD) proteins have been implicated in rare diseases. While
CHD proteins are functionally known to be DNA helicases and chromatin remodeling factors that can regulate
transcription, insight into their structure and how it influences function remains sparse. Even AlphaFold2
models for these proteins have large regions of low confidence (over 60% of residues in CHD8 have pLDDT
scores less than 70). Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular features of these proteins and how
they impact Chiari Malformation such that better diagnostic and treatment approaches can be realized. The
primary goal of this proposal is to produce full-length wild type and disease related variants of three CHD
proteins on NIH’s list of understudied proteins related to rare disease and begin their biochemical and
structural characterization. Our hypothesis is that in vitro cell-free expression can overcome the primary
bottleneck to producing these proteins to begin deeper molecular characterization studies. The rationale
underlying the proposed work is that cell-free expression allows small scale, versatile and rapid optimization
of conditions to increase the chances of synthesizing a full-length protein that has similar solubility,
biochemical and other characteristics as the native protein. Two specific aims will be pursued to complete this
work: 1) Employ cell-free expression to synthesize CHD2, CHD7, and CHD8 as full-length wild-type proteins
along with 2 disease related variants of each. 2) Begin deep profiling of synthesized proteins by evaluating
protein-protein binding and DNA binding and initiate structural characterization. The success of the project
will hinge on recent innovations in our cell-free expression pipeline including the ability to perform both
functional binding and structural studies from cell-free expression reactions of only 25-microliter volume and
without purification. The proposed research is significant since it will reveal new molecular details
about 3 understudied proteins linked to multiple rare diseases. It will also lay the foundation for a workflow
extending our cell-free expression pipeline from bioenergy research and into the biomedical field to permit
its application toward other understudied proteins in the future. The expected outcome of this work is the
synthesis of wild type and mutant variants of CHD2, CHD7 and CHD8 along with initial biochemical and
structural characterization. Follow-on projects are expected to provide more in-depth molecular phenotyping.
The results will immediately impact the study of Chiari Malformation and advance the understanding of the
CHD family of proteins."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic disease with a demanding self-management burden. Few (<25%) adults
with T1D meet ADA-recommended targets for glycemic control, thereby increasing long-term complication risk.
Diabetes technology (insulin pumps; continuous glucose monitoring, or CGM) alleviates management burden
and promotes achievement of treatment goals. CGM systems improve glycemic control, benefitting long-term
health outcomes without increasing risk of hypoglycemia. Major improvement in CGM accuracy has led to
advances in closed loop systems that integrate an insulin pump and CGM to partially automate insulin delivery,
improve glycemic control and reduce T1D management burden. To reap these health benefits, CGM users
must wear the device daily. Despite benefits, a concerning proportion of adults who try CGM later discontinue
use, but remaining drivers of discontinuation and inconsistent use are unclear. Greater understanding of when
and why adults with T1D discontinue CGM after initial adoption is needed to target and tailor well-timed
interventions to promote and sustain consistent CGM use. The proposed study complements the parent K23
(DK119470) goal of refining and evaluating a behavioral intervention, ONBOARD, that aims to promote CGM
adoption and sustained use through targeting top known modifiable barriers (physical, data, social, and trust)
for adults with T1D. Preliminary data from the parent trial show an estimated 24% of CGM adopters
discontinuing use. This mixed method study extends the parent K23 by gathering in-depth qualitative data on
participants reporting CGM non-use 12-months after initial CGM adoption; and conducting longitudinal analysis
on factors linked to reduced CGM use and discontinuation. ONBOARD participants receive 3 months of CGM
supplies to enable initial adoption. We collect CGM, A1c, and psychosocial data over 12 months, creating
opportunity for systematic investigation of CGM use and discontinuation following uptake. The specific aims in
this proposal are to 1) collect in-depth qualitative data on key remaining drivers of CGM discontinuation
through user-centered methods, and 2) identify factors associated with lower CGM use and discontinuation in
the year following CGM initiation using the full K23 sample. Examining remaining modifiable barriers to durable
CGM uptake in adults with T1D will expand the reach of the existing K23 study to optimize timing and content
of support for individuals at risk of discontinuing CGM. Completion of the proposed R03 aims will generate
critical preliminary data to conduct a large scale R01 study to test a refined ONBOARD intervention to promote
uptake and prevent discontinuation of CGM in adults with T1D. Completion of these proposed aims will further
Dr. Tanenbaum’s career goal to establish an independent programmatic line of research focused on optimizing
diabetes technology use to improve health and quality of life outcomes for adults with T1D."
10811762,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Latent cardiotoxicity occurs in children who receive low doses of anthracyclines (e.g. doxorubicin, DOX)
and can be exacerbated by other cardiovascular risk factors. Psychosocial stress is a significant cardiovascular
risk factor and an enormous burden in childhood cancer survivors. Although observational studies demonstrate
that psychosocial stress is associated with higher rates of cardiovascular complications in cancer survivors, the
mechanism of this association has not been elucidated. To fill this gap in knowledge, we developed a “two-hit”
mouse model of juvenile DOX-induced latent cardiotoxicity that is exacerbated by psychosocial stress. The
overall objectives of this project are to determine the molecular mechanisms of DOX/Stress-induced
cardiomyopathy and to test treatments that can prevent it. Our preliminary data demonstrated that exposure of
juvenile mice to a low, yet clinically relevant, dose of DOX (4 mg/kg/week for 3 weeks) activated cardiac p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and induced markers of cellular senescence. Co-administration of
the pleiotropic phytochemical resveratrol with DOX abrogated DOX-activated p38 MAPK and prevented DOX-
induced latent cardiotoxicity. Additionally, after a 5-week recovery period, DOX-exposed mice manifested
exaggerated myocardial fibrosis and increased expression of the senescence marker p21 and senescence-
associated secretory pattern (SASP) when challenged with a validated model of chronic psychosocial stress.
Senolytic therapy with ABT-263 abrogated these effects. The central hypothesis is: psychosocial stress will
exacerbate DOX-induced cardiovascular aging to precipitate overt cardiomyopathy via a p38/senescence-
mediated mechanism. In aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that DOX (4 mg/kg/week for 3 weeks) will activate
p38-dependent cardiovascular aging leading to latent cardiotoxicity. DOX-induced cardiovascular aging will be
prevented by resveratrol and by the p38 selective inhibitor losmapimod, and will be reversed by the senolytic
drug ABT-263. In aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that chronic psychosocial stress (14-day sensory contact
with a dominant animal, and daily 10-minute defeat episodes) will exacerbate DOX-induced cardiovascular
aging leading to overt cardiomyopathy, an effect that will be limited by resveratrol, losmapimod, and ABT-263.
In aim 3, we will characterize the effects of DOX +/- resveratrol, losmapimod, and ABT-263 on cardiovascular
function and remodeling, and markers of cardiovascular aging in immunocompetent EL4 lymphoma tumor-
bearing mice. Then, we will determine the effect of these agents on the chemotherapeutic benefit of DOX in
the tumor-bearing mice. This project is innovative because we will employ a novel “two-hit” mouse model of
DOX/Stress-induced cardiomyopathy to determine, for the first time, the interplay between chemical and
psychosocial stressors in cardiovascular aging. This is significant because it will establish psychosocial stress
as a risk factor for exacerbating DOX-induced cardiovascular aging and will enable the design of effective
therapies to prevent or even reverse chemotherapy-induced cardiovascular aging in cancer survivors."
10811765,"The goal of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) is to completely resolve the genetics of
Alzheimer's disease (AD). We will identify both common and rare variants to cause AD, alter AD risk, and
protect against AD. To this goal, the ADGC will continue to aggregate large numbers of multiethnic cohorts,
harmonized genetic and phenotype data, and perform coordinated analyses of both early and late-onset AD
genetics, and mild cognitive impairment. The rationale for genetic studies is to predict who will develop AD,
understand disease mechanism, and identify new therapeutic targets. This last reason is the most critical.
Most ongoing drug trials target the Aβ peptide, the main component of amyloid plaques, and more recently tau,
the protein that aggregates in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). However, though some Aβ-targeting therapies
are promising, no disease modifying therapies exist. Even if these approaches are successful, multiple
therapies may be needed to reach the ultimate goal of AD prevention. Thus, new targets are needed. Genetic
studies are one method of identifying new drug targets. Targets supported by genetic evidence are 2-3 more
likely to succeed than those without. For this reason, until therapies that effectively prevent AD at a cost that
permits widespread use in all countries, we need additional genetic studies.
To completely resolve AD genetics and develop new therapeutic targets, we will execute the following aims.
Aim 1 is to expand exiting cohorts and add new cohorts for genetic analyses. We will focus on assembling a
multiethnic data set. We will expand Caucasian samples, Caribbean Hispanics, non-Caribbean Hispanics,
African Americans, Asians and subjects from India. Aims 2 is generate array genotyping and whole genome
sequence (WGS) data for all cohorts, and generate imputation panels from WGS AD data These reference
panels with publically available panels will be used to impute all samples. Aim 3 is gene discovery using all
available data including WES and WGA data in genome-wide analyses. We will analyze multiple ethnic groups
separately and in trans-ethnic analyses. Aim 4 is to perform genome-wide analysis of AD-related phenotypes
including cardiovascular traits, cognitive phenotypes, MRI imaging, amyloid and tau PET imaging, and
neuropathology phenotypes. Aim 5 is post-association analyses. We will use bioinformatics approaches and
partner with other investigators using biochemical approaches to link association loci to specific genes.
Methods include genome-wide Capture-C and ATACSeq and massively parallel reporter assays. We will use
pathway and gene cluster approaches and co-expression networks to interpret the biological significance of
genes identified by this and other studies. In addition, we will continue to promote young investigators, and
work with international collaborators such as IGAP to increase the sample size and approaches used."

Cardiovascular disease remains a major source of mortality in the US, and detection and prevention remain
lacking. Machine learning (ML) based detection of cardiovascular disease from raw 12-lead electrocardiogram
(ECG) signals is a digital health technique (ML-ECG) that has shown remarkable potential to improve patient
care. However, the best-developed ML tools require large data sets for training, and lack explainability. A major
long-term goal is to develop ML-ECG approaches that can be equitably deployed in clinical care to help detect
rare but serious diseases across broad populations. The current objectives towards this long-term goal are to (1)
implement self-supervised ML methods to train ML-ECG algorithms with smaller data-sets and (2) develop novel
ML-interpretability methods for ECG-classification algorithms. The central hypothesis is that application of unique
ML-ECG approaches to this rich existing dataset can reduce the amount of data needed for training and devel-
opment of clinically-actionable algorithms, and can provide valuable and as yet unrecognized insight into physio-
logic links used in ML-EC algorithms. The rationale for this project is that: (1) contrastive self-supervised training
allows model development on smaller labeled datasets without significantly compromising accuracy; (2) explain-
ability analyses through generative adversarial learning can fill gaps in understanding of how these algorithms
are adding to clinical knowledge; and (3) an existing dataset of over 1.4 million clinical ECGs provides an ideal
environment in which to apply these techniques. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing 2 specific aims:
(1) Develop contrastive self-supervised training approaches to ECG-classification ML architectures, in order to
reduce the necessary power for highly-accurate predictions; and (2) Apply ML explainability analyses to ECG
classification architectures to understand the features driving predictions. Success in this project will advance the
ML-ECG science to allow its deployment not only in the detection of extremely common disease patterns, but the
more difficult and consequential tasks of identifying rare but serious abnormalities. Moreover, the results will also
provide insight into how such algorithms work."
10811002,"Project Summary
Chronic overconsumption of high fructose-containing food and beverages has emerged as a significant risk
factor for development of obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Fructose
metabolism has been extensively investigated in the hepatocyte, where 50-70% of dietary fructose is
metabolized as well as in the small intestine and kidneys, where the fructose transporter Glut5 is highly
expressed. However, much less is known in other metabolic organs including skeletal muscle, brain and white
adipose tissue. Thus far, the impact of Glut5 and fructose metabolism in intrascapular brown adipose tissue
(iBAT) has not been investigated. While analyzing the diet/feeding-stimulated iBAT transcriptomes to gain
mechanistic insights, we observed a dramatic but transient upregulation of facilitated glucose/fructose
transporter type 5 (Glut5, [Slc2a5]) in iBAT as early as 1 h after feeding from both male and female C57BL/6J
mice but not in antibiotic-treated mice. Consistently, we also observed similar Glut5 upregulation in
differentiated human brown adipocytes after incubation with serum from fed mice. In addition, we also
observed that chronic high fructose consumption dysregulates iBAT basal Glut5 expression. This is
unexpected because Glut5 expression in white fat is fructose-independent. Our data showed for the first time
that iBAT Glut5 regulates circulating fructose homeostasis and mediates fructose-dependent iBAT whitening
and obesity. Fructose metabolism is important for glycogen and lipid accumulation in hepatocyte. Increase in
iBAT fructose metabolism due to fructose-induced Glut5 dysregulation could potentially leads to iBAT
whitening. Together with our preliminary findings that feeding-induced Glut5 expression in iBAT is eliminated in
antibiotic-treated mice, we hypothesize that high-fructose consumption promotes whitening and impairs iBAT
metabolic activity via microbiome-dependent iBAT Glut5 expression. In this proposal, we plan to delineate how
brown adipocyte Glut5 impacts iBAT metabolism. We will also determine whether high-fructose diet increase
Glut5 via microbiota-derived hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) to inhibit iBAT function. Finally, we will determine
liver-x-receptors (LXRs) expressed in brown adipocyte are required for whitening and metabolic activity
impairment in iBAT induced by high-fructose diet. Successful completion of this proposed study will contribute
to our understanding of high fructose diet-induced brown fat whitening and metabolic dysfunction."
10811000,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Although static neck braces are prescribed to patients with head drop resulted from amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), many patients do not use these neck braces because they are uncomfortable and ineffective.
As a result, patients leave their head drop condition untreated, which worsens their ability to breathe, swallow,
speak, and perform other daily tasks. The long-term goal is to treat ALS head drop through an at-home assistive
device. The overall objective in this application is to build a structurally suitable neck exoskeleton for ALS head
drop, with comfortable and easy-to-wear attachments, as well as robust mechanical linkages and joints. The
central hypothesis is that a structurally suitable neck exoskeleton will improve overall users’ satisfaction, increase
head-neck range of motion, and enable social interactions. The rationale for this project is that once a structurally
suitable neck exoskeleton becomes available, it will likely offer a feasible platform to support future clinical trials
and facilitate its translation for domestic use. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing one specific aim:
Determine mechanical factors of a suitable neck exoskeleton critical for ALS head drop. Under this aim, patients
with ALS head drop will be involved in the design process and precisely made components will be used to build
a structurally suitable neck exoskeleton. It will then be evaluated by patients with severe ALS head drop to
determine the extent to which this neck exoskeleton increases head-neck range of motion, enables social
interaction, enhances head-neck movement precision, and achieves overall satisfaction of these participants.
The research proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, because it focuses on
achieving a structurally suitable neck exoskeleton to empower head-neck movements in patients with ALS head
drop by incorporating patients’ feedback and utilizing advanced design and manufacturing methods. The
proposed research is significant because it is the next fundamental step in the continuum of research that is
expected to provide clinically available neck exoskeleton specifically targeted for ALS."
10813029,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an increasingly common and devastating neurodegenerative disease with
no available disease-modifying treatments. Most treatment approaches attack a single disease component,
either the β-amyloid or tau protein pathways, for example. However, pleiotropic interventions will likely be
needed. The dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (Dyrk1a) protein represents one
such target, with activity in β-amyloid, tau, and neuroinflammatory pathways. Each of these pathways
contributes to neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits in AD. As such, compounds that inhibit Dyrk1a offer a
promising new therapeutic approach through novel simultaneous modulation of tau, amyloid, and
neuroinflammatory pathways. To this end, our medicinal chemistry efforts have delivered a potent and brain
penetrant molecule, Dyr219, which upon dosing in the 3xTg-AD model, improves behavioral and both tau and
amyloid neuropathological features of AD with no overt adverse effects (Branca et al., Aging Cell, 2017, 16(5),
1146-1154). In a recent extended 6-month study, we observe no motor effects in wild-type or 3xTg-AD mice
following chronic daily dosing, and larger reductions to insoluble, hyperphosphorylated tau, neurofibrillary
tangles and insoluble Aß42 peptides and amyloid plaques. Recently, we have confirmed that Dyr219 also triggers Dyrk1a protein degradation, assigned to inhibition of the Dyrk1a autophosphorylation process. This effect reduces levels of active Dyrk1A in vivo, contributing to efficacy and pointing to a PK-PD relationship between Dyr219 brain exposure and robust neuropathological effects. Ongoing medicinal chemistry efforts directed at enhancement of oral bioavailability and kinome selectivity have recently delivered significantly improved analogs (Dyr476: F% 73%, B/P 0.39) and (DYR533: F% 100%, B/P 0.30 S(35)-selectivity score 0.03). Importantly, Samumed has recently announced the discovery of SM07883, an IND-ready, potent, oral Type 1 Dyrk1a inhibitor which exhibits significant tau pathology
reduction in JNPL3 mice. We feel the latter validates the feasibility of our short-term pre-clinical hypothesis and
supports the necessity of the aims described herein. In summary, we propose a robust medicinal chemistry pipeline, coupled with in vivo testing of promising compounds in mice, with the aim of delivering molecules superior to Dyr219 that address oral bioavailability, are deemed safe in pre-clinical toxicology models and recapitulate its in vivo effects. We expect our new molecules to be effective at modifying the course of pathology and cognitive decline in AD."
10812010,"Glutathione-S-transferase μ-1 (GSTM1) belongs to the superfamily of GSTs that are phase II antioxidant
enzymes and are regulated by nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Homozygous carriers of the
GSTM1 null allele, GSTM1(0), are deficient of the enzyme and activity. GSTM1(0) is associated with increased
risks of cancer and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). We discovered that GSTM1(0) is associated with more rapid
CKD progression in the African American Study of Kidney Disease (AASK) trial participants, independent of and
is additive to the effect of the Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) high-risk variants. This association has been replicated
in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, and in multiple other populations. While the upstream
regulation of GSTM1 has been defined, its downstream effect is poorly understood. Our preliminary data suggest
that GSTM1 modulates the balance of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gaseous molecule that is an end product of the
transsulfuration pathway (TSP) and has emerged as an important regulator of cell metabolism and signaling.
 We reported that global Gstm1 knockout (KO) mice have increased renal oxidative stress, inflammation and
kidney disease in angiotensin II-induced hypertension (Ang II-HTN) and the remnant model of CKD. The
mechanism(s) by which deficiency of the ubiquitous GSTM1 enzyme exaggerates renal oxidative stress,
inflammation and injury is unknown. Bone marrow cross-transplantation implicated GSTM1 deficiency in the
parenchyma rather than bone marrow derived cells drive renal inflammation. Through metabolic profiling, we
have strong preliminary data suggesting that GSTM1 modulates the TSP that is critical in maintaining optimal
cellular function. Compared to control mice, Gstm1 KO mice have 3-4 fold higher renal levels of the TSP
intermediate metabolite cystathionine and significantly decreased levels of H2S, a bioactive end product of the
TSP that could be a factor that can explain the phenotypes observed in GSTM1 deficient humans and mice.
Moreover, loss of GSTM1 downregulates the activity of cystathionine y-lyase enzyme that generates H2S in the
TSP. In AASK, compared to those with GSTM1 active allele, homozygous GSTM1(0) participants with high
serum levels of cystathionine were ~ 2 times more likely to have a doubling of serum creatinine or ESRD. Our
survival analysis suggests the impact of GSTM1 on the composite outcome in AASK is determined by levels of
urinary sulfate, an end product of H2S. We hypothesize that loss of GSTM1 results in lower TSP activity with
deleterious impact on CKD states. We will: 1) Test the GSTM1- TSP- H2S axis in Ang II-HTN and CKD models;
2) Test whether GSTM1 informs the vascular-immune and renal epithelial-immune interface effects on renal
oxidative stress, inflammation and injury, and dysregulated TSP pathway; and 3) Determine whether H2S levels
segregate with GSTM1 genotype and clinical outcomes in CKD Stages 2-5; and leverage our randomized double
blind placebo-controlled trial as an external validation of the relationship of H2S and GSTM1, and to test whether
sulforaphane, a stimulator of Nrf2, can increase H2S levels in CKD patients in a GSTM1 dependent manner."
10812011,"More than one in five adult Latinos in the United States has arthritis and Latinos experience greater joint pain
and limitations than non-Latino Whites. Physical activity (PA) improves arthritis symptoms, yet Latinos are less
likely to engage in any PA (50%) than non-Latino Whites (65%). Camine con Gusto (CCG), the Arthritis
Foundation’s evidence-based 6-week Spanish-language version of Walk With Ease, is one of few PA
interventions tested in Latinos. CCG was shown in a pre-post study to improve outcomes in 233 Latinos with
arthritis. The Osteoarthritis Action Alliance developed an online portal for CCG with enhancements including
weekly emails/texts, tracking/goal setting, and video/audio content based on feedback from Latinos and
community-based organizations (CBOs) that offer CCG. Participants expressed a need for additional, more
resource-intensive components to CCG that have yet to be implemented or tested. The overall goal of this R34
is to plan an assessor blinded community-based randomized optimization trial to test recommended additional
components for CCG PA initiation and maintenance. To evaluate which additional components contribute
meaningfully to increasing PA, we will use the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), an approach to
developing highly efficient and scalable behavioral interventions that include only the most potent and cost-
effective components. Using MOST, we will: 1) Determine the set of components (pedometer, CCG promotora,
and maintenance promotora) when added to CCG that meaningfully increase daily steps (primary outcome)
immediately post-CCG and 6- and 12-months post-CCG; 2) Evaluate the set of components, when added to
CCG, that meaningfully improve secondary outcomes (i.e., arthritis symptoms, sleep quality) post-CCG and at
6- and 12-months; and 3) Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention components for scalability in
CBOs serving Latinos with arthritis. We have worked closely with our Community Advisory Board (CAB) on this
R34 proposal and will work with them on all aspects of the planning grant and proposed trial. Results from
each aim will inform the decision on which set of components has the greatest impact on PA initiation and
maintenance for the best cost. In this planning period, we will: 1) Use CAB input and behavioral theory to
finalize the scientific details for the study; this will include refining CCG portal enhancements and additional
intervention components (i.e., pedometer and promotoras), finalizing outcome measures, collection methods,
the research and cost-effectiveness protocols and statistical analysis plan. 2) Use CAB input to develop the
materials and application for the proposed trial; this will include recruitment, retention, and adherence
materials and approaches; manual of operating procedures; data management plan; training manuals, and
fidelity assessment plans; data safety and monitoring plan; and a detailed project timeline and budget for the
future clinical trial. This proposed R34 will plan and prepare a well-powered randomized optimization trial
aimed at reducing PA disparities among Latinos with arthritis, an understudied population in arthritis research."
10812012,"ABSTRACT: Glioblastoma (GBM) has a complex infiltrating tumor microenvironment which extends well beyond
the visible enhancing tumor margins and plays a substantial role in GBM recurrence and poor outcomes.
Unfortunately, in the absence of a precise spatial map of tumor extent, it is often difficult to differentiate infiltrating
tumor from vasogenic edema on clinical MRI during radiation/surgical planning. The untreated infiltrating tumor
ultimately contributes to over 90% of GBM recurrences. An equally pressing challenge is the difficulty in
distinguishing recurrent tumor from treatment-effects following chemoradiation. Due to the histologically diverse
landscape of post-treated lesions, treatment-effects often co-exist with tumor recurrence, and mimic appearance
on imaging. In the absence of reliable tools, 15-20% of patients with GBM recurrence are incorrectly diagnosed
due to sampling error associated with intracranial biopsy. Thus, developing a non-invasive spatial map of
GBM tumor extent that can reliably identify infiltrating/recurrent tumor from confounding pathologies (treatment-
effects/edema), will have significant implications in radiation/surgical-planning and post-treatment management.
Recently, we developed a Radiomic-Image (Rad-I) map of tumor extent that uses computational features
corresponding to the micro-architectural image measurements of disorder in the local intensity gradients (i.e.,
gradient entropy). The initial version of the Rad-I map has been evaluated to distinguish recurrent tumors versus
treatment-effects on post-treatment Gd-T1w MRI with an 85% accuracy on n=75 studies, and to distinguish
infiltrating tumor versus vasogenic edema on pre-treatment MRI scans with a 94% accuracy on n=42 studies.
In this R01 project, we propose to improve on our initial version of Rad-I map by incorporating (1) additional
anatomical (T2w, FLAIR) and functional MR sequences (perfusion) and (2) a novel “lesion complexity” feature,
which captures organizational changes in the tissue composition via graph-theoretic approaches on MRI scans.
Overcoming limitations pertaining to small cohorts and lack of spatially mapped ex-vivo histology for validation,
Rad-I maps will be extensively validated on (1) a large multi-institutional MRI cohort with co-localized
histopathology and (2) the PRESERVE clinical trial designed to capture GBM heterogeneity via multiple co-
localized tissue samples/lesion. These cohorts will also allow for establishing associations of our new radiomic
features with underlying histological/molecular tumor characteristics- a prerequisite for clinical adoption. Lastly,
Rad-I maps will be evaluated within a tumor board survey to address the clinically challenging problem of
distinguishing recurrent tumors versus treatment effects. Criteria for success for Rad-I maps are that they are
at least non-inferior to the accuracy of stereotactic biopsies (85-90%) in identifying tumor niches corresponding
to (a) viable/infiltrating tumor vs. edema and (b) recurrent tumor vs. treatment effects. Multi-institutional validation
and end-user (tumor board) feedback will further confirm the utility of Rad-I maps as a noninvasive alternative to
surgical biopsies; thereby paving the way for radiation/surgical and post-treatment management in GBM tumors."
10814131,"Abstract
 Spinal cord injury (SCI) is debilitating. Astrocytes are the predominant component of the spinal scar.
Defining the complex molecular regulation during astrogliosis is fundamentally important for developing
effective therapeutic strategies. We were the first to systematically analyze the expression profiles of long non-
coding RNA (lncRNA) (>200 bp), a type of regulatory RNA that plays important roles, in purified astrocytes
from adult spinal cords across SCI stages. There is a large knowledge gap in lncRNAs' roles and mechanisms
in astrogliosis after SCI. As <2% of the genome is associated with protein-coding genes, innovative targeting of
non-coding RNAs can greatly enlarge the number of druggable targets and facilitate new classes of
mechanistic discoveries. Towards the overarching goal of defining the mechanisms of astrogliosis in SCI and
identifying novel molecular targets for treating chronic SCI, we discovered that Zeb2os, a highly conserved
lncRNA, plays an important functional role in astrogliosis. Data showed that Zeb2os expression has high
correlation over the injury time course with its antisense protein coding gene Zeb2 and the essential
astrogliosis factor Stat3. Significantly, Zeb2os shRNA knockdown (KD) in vivo by Adeno Associated Virus
(AAV) injection led to attenuated astrogliosis, shown by astrocyte morphology, reduced GFAP and pSTAT3
expression, and reduced lesion size. Additionally, Zeb2os KD in primary astrocytes significantly decreased
expression of many genes, including Gfap, Zeb2, Stat3, neurocan, phosphacan and integrins that are involved
in scar development. Our RNAscope data demonstrated Zeb2os-FZeb2 and Zeb2os- pSTAT3 colocalization in
GFAP+ cells. Furthermore, ChIP-Seq experiments revealed STAT3 bound to the Zeb2 promoter region.
Notably, our data and studies by others provided evidence that, after injury, there is a change of astrocytes
from an initial beneficial state (reactive astrocytes, RA) to a maladaptive state (scar-forming astrocytes, SA)
expressing molecules that inhibit neuroregeneration. Importantly, attenuating astrocytic scar progression with
anti-integrin neutralizing antibodies promoted functional improvement after SCI. Based on our exciting
findings and others', we propose to: a) test the hypothesis that lncRNA Zeb2os regulates astrogliosis through a
Zeb2os/Zeb2/Stat3 axis, b) decipher additional mechanisms by which Zeb2os regulates astrocytes by
comprehensively identifying its target genes and pathways, and c) define the effects of manipulating Zeb2os
and target genes on anatomical and functional outcomes in vivo by AAV injection. Our goal is not to remove
the scar; it is to attenuate later stages of scar progression and the scar's inhibitory effects on
neuroregeneration without interrupting neuroprotective effects at early phases. These
team of investigators with unique and strong expertise in SCI, astrocyte biology and genomics. Overall,
studies will be led by
these

thereby reveal new molecular targets for treating chronic SCI."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementia (AD/ADRD) is the 6th leading cause of death in the United

with real-world data (RWD), such as electronic health records (EHRs), claims, and billing data among others,
offer unique opportunities to generate real-world evidence (RWE) that will have direct translational impacts on
AD/ADRD. In the past, RWD such as EHRs have limited use for AD/ADRD drug repurposing and primarily used
only for validating and evaluating the hypotheses generated by molecular level predictions of AD/ADRD
repurposing agents, partially due to a number of key methodological gaps: (1) the lack of integration with
existing rich biological and pathophysiological knowledge of AD/ADRD for hypothesis generation, (2) the lack of
validated computable phenotyping (CP) and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms and tools that can
accurately define the study populations, extract key relevant patient characteristics and meaningful outcomes
(e.g., MMSE scores to determine severity), (3) the lack of consideration on the heterogeneity of the disease (i.e.,
AD/ADRD subtypes), and (4) the lack of recognition of the inherent biases in RWD and the need of applying
causal inference principles. The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive machine learning based
causal inference framework for generating high-throughput and high-quality drug repurposing hypotheses for
AD/ADRD by integrating heterogeneous information sources. There are three aims in this project. Aim 1 aims
at developing computable phenotypes to extract key patient characteristics and outcomes relevant to AD/ADRD
drug repurposing studies from RWD. Aim 2 aims at developing a learning-based causal inference framework
for generating drug repurposing hypotheses from RWD, a deep knowledge embedding framework for generating
drug repurposing hypotheses from biomedical knowledge bases (BKB); and a mutual information enhancement
framework that combines the information from both RWD and BKB to further improve the quality of the generated
hypotheses. Aim 3 aims at validating the generated hypotheses with diverse data sources and approaches.
The project will leverage the patient data from two large clinical research networks (CRNs) contributing to the
national Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) – covering ~15 million Floridians and ~11
million New Yorkers. The developed algorithms and software will be open sourced and widely disseminated
within the CRNs and the AD/ADRD research communities."
10814147,"Project Summary/Abstract
Each year in the US ~500,000 individuals seek care after burn injury, and ~40,000 sustain major thermal burn injury (MThBI) requiring hospitalization. Approximately three-quarters of hospitalized MThBI survivors require skin grafting, a surgical procedure in which skin or another material is applied to the burn injury site (graft site). More than half of individuals who receive a skin grafts develop severe unremitting graft site pain. New non-opioid interventions to improve pain outcomes in MThBI survivors receiving skin graft are urgently needed.
  Importantly, the scientific community has increasingly recognized that investing millions in traditional RCTs, that provide only a “thumbs up or down” result, is a poor scientific investment. RCTs provide far greater value when (1) interventions have been shown to effectively engage targeted biological mechanisms are tested, and (2) the trial assesses whether hypothesized mechanisms mediate any observed therapeutic effect. During my K12 award, I gained valuable skills and training in the conduct and analysis of traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and experience conducting research in the MThBI population. In addition, data obtained from my pilot intervention trial testing the ability of vitamin D (vit D) to improve MThBI pain outcomes support the safety, feasibility, and exciting potential of this natural product intervention to reduce or prevent chronic pain after MThBI. Vit D is a promising, low-cost, widely available intervention with potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Vit D has been shown to have powerful effects on immune cell populations, and has been demonstrated to improve pain and related outcomes across a range of neuro/inflammatory disorders.
  This 3-year NCCIH K23 will build upon my K12 training, and will provide me with the necessary skills and experience to conduct a “state-of-the-art” mechanistic trial of vit D in MThBI survivors. Specifically, during the K23 I will learn to apply the latest mass cytometry methods to serial blood samples obtained from RCT participants to evaluate the degree to which increases in circulating vit D levels result in (1) increases in anti-inflammatory monocyte phenotypes and regulatory T cells, and (2) reduction in pro-inflammatory toll-like receptor 4 signaling and effector T-cells (e.g., Th1 and Th17 cells). In addition, I will learn to use advanced statistical methods (elastic net algorithms and multiple parallel mediation models) to evaluate whether these immune cell changes mediate treatment effects, adjusting for any baseline differences in key psychosocial factors.
  The study of immune mechanisms of chronic pain development is a rich, exciting, burgeoning area of science. Proposed K23 activities are not only ideal for evaluating vit D target engagement and mechanistic hypotheses in MThBI survivors, but will also provide me with an excellent foundation of skills for a career as an NIH-funded chronic pain researcher and clinical trialist. In sum, the skills and training obtained during my 3-year NCCIH K23 will transition me from a “thumbs up or down” clinical trialist to one capable of interrogating engagement of immune mechanisms and testing specific hypotheses regarding innate and adaptive immunity."
10814151,"The entorhinal cortex (EC) is long known to be the region affected first in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with
symptoms such as disorientation, confusion and inability to navigate appearing early in life. But more recently,
a region in the brainstem- locus coeruleus (LC) was found to have tau accumulation in young healthy adults,
making it the first region in the brain with AD pathology. The LC is known to be important for arousal and
controls the sleep/wake switch. The neurons of LC project to several regions including EC and hippocampus
which are known to be important for spatial memory. Unsurprisingly, one of the earliest symptoms of AD is
spatial difficulties and it is possible that early pathology in LC affects sleep leading to spatial memory deficits.
With both LC and EC important for memory, we aim to identify which of them is more vulnerable to tau and Aβ
pathology. To explore this possibility, we will first inject LC and EC regions of wildtype mouse with pathological
tau derived from human AD brains to make them dysfunctional, and evaluate their neuronal function. We will
also assess sleep and test memory performance in relevant behavior tasks. To understand how aβ affects tau
pathology, we will inject human tau in the APP Knock-In mice which has physiological amounts of APP
expressed in them. We will determine if Aβ together with tau worsens the neuronal function of LC and EC
neurons and it sleep and memory is impaired further. We will use multi-region silicon probes to simultaneously
record activity from LC or medial EC and hippocampal neurons. The MEC and hippocampal neurons are well
characterized with properties that can be easily measured using spatial navigation tasks. We will make use of
virtual reality head-fixed setup for the animals to navigate in, and allowing us to quickly test animal’s memory in
any context and environment. The animals will be tested for object-location memory and context-dependent
memory in virtual environment. We will use machine learning algorithms to decode animal’s position in the LC,
MEC and HPC neural data and determine if it is affected by tau or Aβ or both. We will also assess sleep
parameters and correlate with memory. We hypothesize that tau in LC and EC will make its neurons
dysfunctional and directly affect sleep and memory, and this in concert with Aβ will exacerbate neuronal
dysfunction leading to increased sleep problems and spatial memory impairment as seen in early AD. With this
we aim to identify electrophysiological biomarker of neuronal dysfunction before the onset of behavioral
troubles. We will test if increasing the neuronal firing in hypoactive neurons and reducing the firing in
hyperactive neurons will restore downstream neuronal dysfunction and reverse sleep problems and cognitive
impairment.
The proposal brings together diverse fields (neuroscience, pathology and computational neuroscience)
applying large-scale recording techniques simultaneously across multiple brain regions to develop analytical
and predictive tests to interrogate function in vulnerable brain regions that are dysfunctional in AD."
10814205,"Neurodegenerative disorders represent a significant challenge to human health. Many therapeutic strategies
revolve around suppressing death of the neuronal cell body. However, neuronal connectivity depends on long
projections called axons that use specialized mechanisms to survive in isolation from the soma. The
degeneration of axons is a common, sometimes initiating event in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders
including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and peripheral neuropathies. Protecting axon health is
necessary for sustaining functional connectivity and will have broad relevance to many diseases. Disease
onset and severity can vary significantly between patients suggesting there are important, undiscovered factors
that influence axon vulnerability to pathological degeneration. The goal of this project is to define novel
pathways controlling the fate of a damaged axon. Axon injury stimulates a local self-destruct mechanism that
promotes axon dismantling and clearance by the immune system. The enzymes NMNAT2 and SARM1
represent a critical regulatory node in this self-destruction program. Boosting NMNAT2 is neuroprotective and
has therapeutic potential. We will define a new mechanism controlling NMNAT2 abundance in axon segments.
We will also identify new contributions for autophagy in axon susceptibility and stress signaling. These studies
will generate new insight on local mechanisms controlling axon health and reveal new treatment opportunities
in neurodegenerative diseases."

10784860,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This K23 proposal will investigate the timing of the relationship between vascular risk and amyloid (Aβ) on
tau accumulation during the preclinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), to determine the critical window
for intervention. Our prior studies demonstrated a synergy between specific vascular risks, especially high
systolic blood pressure (SBP) and body mass index (BMI), with Aβ in accelerating tau PET burden and
cognitive decline in preclinical AD. The prevalence and modifiability of hypertension and obesity add to their
excellent potential as combination therapeutic targets with Aβ for prevention efforts in AD. However, the
optimal age group to target for intervention remains unknown. Epidemiology studies suggest that midlife
vascular risks are most strongly associated with increased risk of AD, while effects are mixed or reversed in
late-life. The goal of this project is to address the following key knowledge gaps: 1) how early and over what
age period do elevated SBP and BMI, synergistically with Aβ accumulation, drive greater tau pathology, 2)
whether plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) measures may be more sensitive than tau PET in detecting an
early interaction in midlife when the AD pathological burden is low, and 3) how longitudinal changes of these
tau measures relate to the synergistic effects of vascular risk and Aβ on prospective cognitive decline. We
will accomplish these goals using an innovative approach: i) harmonizing the breadth of cross-sectional data
from the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS) and Framingham Heart Study across 5+ decades from mid- to
late-life to determine the timing of the vascular-Aβ effects on tau PET (Aim 1) and plasma p-tau (Aim 2), and
ii) leveraging the depth of longitudinal characterization in HABS to elucidate the effects on longitudinal tau
pathology, and determine how changes in tau PET and p-tau relate to cognitive decline (Aim 3). Our findings
will inform the design of combination clinical trials targeting vascular risk and Aβ in preclinical AD, by
identifying the population at risk and by establishing whether plasma p-tau can detect this early synergy,
which can greatly expand accessibility and diversity of research studies. Our preliminary results suggest
that the synergistic effects on tau pathology are greatest during midlife, which has the potential to shift
research and clinical practice paradigms to focus prevention efforts even earlier. This career development
award will be powered by a cohesive mentorship and advisory team of leading experts with complementary
expertise in AD and vascular contribution to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID). The rigorous training
plan will enable the candidate – a practicing cognitive neurologist with a strong commitment to AD research,
to acquire new expertise in PET methodologies, plasma biomarkers, epidemiology and mechanisms of
VCID, and advanced statistical methods including clinical trials design. The scientific knowledge and
research skills gained from this K23 award will advance the candidate towards an independent clinician-
scientist career to identify, understand, and ultimately intervene on vascular contributions to preclinical AD."
10784904,"Project Summary The release of Ca from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via the ryanodine receptors (RyR2)
regulates the heartbeat. This Ca release process is tightly controlled in healthy hearts but goes awry in diseased
hearts due to genetic or acquired defects of the RyR2 channel complex. These defects typically make the
channel complex hyperactive or leaky, thus giving rise to aberrant Ca release (ACR). While the harmful role of
RyR2-mediated ACR is well-established in a spectrum of cardiac pathologies, much less is known regarding
how ACR is translated into a specific disease phenotype. For instance, ACR is associated with both arrhythmias
and cell death in heart failure and metabolic heart diseases. However, in settings of catecholaminergic
polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), a genetic arrhythmia syndrome due to mutations in RyR2 or its
accessory proteins, ACR results in arrhythmias without signs of pathological remodeling. Mitochondria are
involved in myocyte Ca homeostasis to regulate energy production but also cell death. Intriguingly, our recent
study provided evidence that mitochondria behave as an efficient Ca sink in the setting of CPVT, which appears
to be critical to mitigate detrimental consequences of ACR. Interestingly, this protective Ca-absorbing role seems
to be unique to CPVT mitochondria. In contrast, in wild type and several other disease models enhancing
mitochondrial Ca uptake stimulates the emission of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and exacerbates RyR2 leak
and arrhythmias. These studies suggest that mitochondria play a key role in translating ACR into a specific
pathophenotype. They also raised important questions as to why mitochondria in CPVT act as a protective Ca
sink and how that impacts Ca-dependent arrhythmias. Based on data in the literature and our preliminary results,
we hypothesize that protective changes in CPVT mitochondria alter SR-mitochondria interplay to shape diastolic
Ca signal and impact Ca-dependent arrhythmias. Specifically, we propose that in CPVT a dynamic phosphate
(Pi)-based mitochondrial Ca handling mechanism converts mitochondria into a protective Ca sink so they can
absorb ACR; in parallel, tethering (physical contacts) between mitochondria and SR, also known as
mitochondria-associated-membranes (MAMs) are promoted in CPVT to facilitate SR-mitochondria Ca transfer.
Thus, we propose that modulating the Pi-based mitochondrial Ca handling, as well as SR-mitochondria tethering
both impacts arrhythmogenesis. We have designed multiscale studies (from molecule to whole animal) that
employ novel genetic mice models/adeno-associated virus (AAV) 9-mediated gene transfer. We will utilize
methods of cellular physiology, protein biochemistry, and in vivo cardiac functional assays to test our hypothesis.
The proposed studies will help us gain a better understanding of protective molecular changes of CPVT
mitochondria, thus not only benefitting the design of mechanism-based therapies for CPVT, but also providing
clues for the development of therapies for a range of Ca-dependent cardiac dysfunctions that are linked to ACR."

Deaths due to alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), a serious consequence of alcohol use disorder (AUD),
have risen substantially over the past two decades. Although reduction and cessation of alcohol use is a vital
component of treating ALD, few patients with AUD and ALD receive treatment for AUD, including behavioral
treatment or medications (MAUD), due to clinician, patient, and system-level barriers ranging from lack of
familiarity to stigma. Treatment of AUD, including MAUD, is associated with liver-specific benefits in patients
with ALD, such as reductions in complications including cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver, and hepatic
decompensation, or severe deterioration of liver function. As such, guidelines on the treatment of ALD
recommend AUD treatment be provided to patients with AUD and ALD, however little is known regarding which
treatments may be of greatest benefit in this population and how to deliver them most effectively. There is a
lack of data regarding the comparative effectiveness of different forms of MAUD among patients with AUD and
ALD and limited consideration of the perspectives of patients with AUD and ALD with regard to receipt of AUD
treatment. Finally, while multidisciplinary teams of co-located hepatology and addiction specialists to facilitate
AUD treatment in patients with AUD and ALD have been described, these models of care are resource-
intensive and not commonly available. Therefore, alternative strategies are needed to inform delivery of AUD
treatment for patients with both AUD and ALD. Hepatology clinicians are well-positioned to provide integrated
AUD treatment, such as MAUD and brief counseling, for patients with AUD and ALD in the context of routine
hepatology care. Existing NIAAA resources, such as the Healthcare Professional’s Core Resource on Alcohol
(HPCR) and Alcohol Treatment Navigator (ATN), are readily available but have not been tailored for
implementation in hepatology clinics. Therefore, the Specific Aims of this work are to: 1) Determine the
comparative effectiveness of different forms of MAUD among patients with AUD by liver disease severity,
relative to no MAUD, 2) Elicit AUD treatment preferences among patients with AUD and ALD, particularly
regarding integrated MAUD and brief counseling in hepatology clinics, and 3) Determine the feasibility and
acceptability of a novel implementation intervention to promote MAUD and brief counseling in hepatology
clinics using the HPCR and ATN with clinical decision support. As a board-certified hepatologist and addiction
medicine specialist with training in health services research, I am well-suited to lead efforts to integrate AUD
treatment into hepatology clinics. Guided by mentors with expertise in pharmacoepidemiology, mixed-methods
research, clinical trials, and implementation science, this work will generate important foundational data and
provide me with the opportunity to build methodological expertise in these complementary areas. This will be
critical to achieve my goal of becoming an independent clinician-investigator dedicated to optimizing the care
of patients with AUD and ALD."
10912801,"Project Summary
Through the proposed research and training plan, the PI seeks to develop into an independent investigator with
the career goal of identifying targeted patient blood management interventions to improve outcomes in pediatric
surgical patients. Patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery for Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) are poised
to benefit from many of these interventions. Spinal fusion carries a risk of large surgical blood losses and
perioperative red blood cell transfusion, which are associated with adverse outcomes in this population. These
patients are mostly adolescent females, a group more susceptible to iron deficiency and resulting anemia at
baseline due to iron losses with menses, and who suffer an additional insult to iron stores during surgery.
Nevertheless, iron status is not routinely monitored in this setting and there is no standard of care for preoperative
iron supplementation. Iron is a nutritionally essential trace element important not only for red blood cell
production, but also for muscle function and neurotransmitter synthesis and signaling. Therefore, the treatment
of preoperative iron deficiency is an important target for optimizing hemoglobin prior to surgery, reducing
transfusion rates, and improving patient outcomes. On its own and as the primary cause of anemia, iron
deficiency was identified by our group as the only risk factor for transfusion which is modifiable preoperatively.
In addition, iron supplementation is shown to alleviate impairments of physical and cognitive capacity associated
with even mild forms of iron deficiency in adolescent females. A pilot study conducted at our institution identified
iron deficiency in 36% of AIS patients prior to surgery, with preoperative iron status highly correlated with iron
status during surgical recovery. Consequently, we plan to examine iron deficiency as a modifiable risk factor for
transfusion and impaired postoperative cognitive and physical capacity in this vulnerable population. Previous
trials of brief iron interventions in high-risk adult surgical patients, mostly with unknown iron status, do not inform
the care of iron deficient adolescents and were not designed to address postoperative functional outcomes. We
will therefore perform a single-center randomized controlled trial in which iron-deficient AIS patients identified
using physiologically-based serum markers will be randomized to a 3-month preoperative regimen of daily oral
iron or placebo, to test the hypotheses that preoperative iron supplementation 1) reduces the rate of red blood
cell transfusion, 2) improves postoperative neurocognition compared to a preoperative baseline, and 3) improves
patient-reported physical functioning during recovery. Our results will ultimately improve outcomes in this
vulnerable pediatric population and provide evidence for patient blood management approaches to reduce
transfusions amid recent severe blood shortages."
10799114,"The long-term goal of our research is to improve mobility, functional independence, and quality of life in
patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) by developing conservative interventions. PAD is a
manifestation of atherosclerosis, which produces blockages in the leg arteries, and results in insufficient blood
flow to the legs. PAD results in significant gait deficits and an overall sedentary lifestyle. Our prior work showed
that the biochemical (oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction) and histological (myofiber degeneration
and fibrosis) characteristics of PAD muscles are altered compared to controls. These myopathic changes are
due to cycles of ischemia and reperfusion, and they correlate to functional limitations (walking distance and calf
muscle strength). Limb ischemia from PAD is the most common disorder treated within the vascular surgery
service of the Omaha Veterans Affairs Medical Center. The most effective treatment for increasing the distances
that patients with PAD can walk is supervised exercise therapy (SET). However, SET uses pain onset to guide
exercise intensity and rest cycles. These repeated bouts of ischemia/reperfusion could cause further pathological
damage to muscle myofibers and oxidative processes. Such adverse effects of ischemia may explain why not
all patients improve with SET. Preventing cycles of ischemia-reperfusion during SET can improve walking
performance without further muscle biochemistry damage in patients with PAD. We propose using hemodynamic
responses to modulate exercise intensity and prevent ischemia during SET. Muscle oxygen-guided supervised
exercise therapy (M-SET) can prevent ischemia onset and thus preserve muscle mass and function during
exercise therapy in patients with PAD. The aims are:
Aim 1: To determine the exercise outcomes of an M-SET versus a standard SET session in patients with
PAD. Aim 2: To determine the acute effect of M-SET versus standard SET on oxidative stress and
inflammation in patients with PAD. Aim 3: To determine the effect of 12 weeks of M-SET versus standard
SET on exercise outcomes, muscle biochemistry, and subject-reported preference in patients with PAD.
We will measure exercise outcomes during one session each of M-SET (using StO2 on the calf to modulate
exercise) and SET, in 12 patients with PAD using a cross-over design. Exercise outcomes will be assessed by
the total distance patients walked during the session, metabolic cost, metabolic equivalents of the task, physical
activity enjoyment, and rate of perceived exertion. In Aim 2, oxidative stress will be measured using peripheral
blood mononuclear cells before and after each exercise session (SET and M-SET) in all patients. During the
standard SET session, subjects will walk until claudication pain becomes severe and the participant needs to
stop. Then subjects will rest until claudication pain subsides. Afterward, subjects will walk again, repeating the
cycle for up to 50 minutes. M-SET will use an StO2 threshold that is 15% lower level than baseline StO2 levels.
Subjects will stop walking once they reach the threshold and rest until StO2 levels return to baseline. Then,
subjects will begin walking again, repeating this cycle for 50 total minutes (including walking and rest). Patients
from Aims 1 and 2 will be randomly assigned to either a 12-week M-SET or standard SET (6 per group) program.
Training will be performed three times weekly as described above. Subjects will be evaluated before and after
the intervention to capture initial and absolute walking distances and 7-day physical activity. Muscle biochemistry
will be quantified using mitochondrial function, mitochondrial oxidative dynamics, and reactive oxygen species
production before and after training. Results will support a full clinical trial and rehabilitation recommendations."

Respiratory viral infection, such as seasonal flu and COVID pandemic, has a significant impact on global health.
Influenza virus epidemics result in severe illness, hospitalizations, and deaths, especially among elderly people.
Aging is associated with a decline in immune function, making older adults more susceptible to severe flu
symptoms and complications. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of age-associated immune responses
in flu is crucial for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies. The baseline increase in
inflammation, often referred to as inflammaging, is a major driver of age-related pathophysiological changes.
Murine models of aging have been shown to have qualitatively and quantitively impaired anti-influenza immune
responses: aged lungs exhibit altered myeloid cell recruitment and function; lower titers of neutralizing
antibodies; and delayed and diminished recruitment of CD4 and CD8 T cells to the lung during infection, which
results in delayed viral clearance. Aging alters all organ systems, not just the immune system; as such, aging
may also impact the host response to Influenza A virus (IAV) through direct changes in lung tissue. Nevertheless,
little is known about how immune cells interact with epithelial and endothelial cells in the lung and how these
interactions contribute to the host defense, tissue injury, wound healing in the lung and coagulopathy
systemically with aging. Previously published research from the team and others demonstrate that aged immune
cells drive a senescent phenotype in non-immune tissues, and that a subset of type 2 innate lymphoid cells
(ILC2s) promotes wound healing and tissue repair in the lung following IAV infection. These observations
highlight the importance of crosstalk among immune, epithelial, and endothelial cells during infection, which also
demand new methodology to more comprehensively investigate the colocalization of these cellular components.
New spatial sequencing techniques, such as the 10x Genomics Visium platform, offer the ability to identify cells
and their gene expression profiles in situ at a resolution not previously possible, particularly when paired with
scRNA-seq. Therefore, the team seek to utilize a combination of scRNA-seq, spatial sequencing, and bulk RNA-
seq to generate a multifaceted, high-resolution atlas of young and aged lung tissue following influenza infection
and identify key changes induced by aging in this clinically relevant setting in this proposed study. Using
advanced computational algorithms, the team will further delineate how lung epithelial cells affect the migration
and tissue retention of immune cells, how immune cells trigger tissue repair and endothelial cell activation and
coagulation, and how novel molecular pathways affect inflammation and fibrosis in the resolution phase of
infection in the proposed study. Overall, the team anticipate that our project will identify potential targets for the
development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat severe flu symptoms in elderly people."
10797571,"ABSTRACT
Development of covalent drugs for cancer therapy relies heavily on identifying the full spectrum of on- and off-
targets within the proteome, along with the specific site of inhibitor binding to each target. Currently we cannot
predict the set of targetable cysteines for a given inhibitor nor the potential for covalent labeling of off-target
proteins, which can lead to unintended toxicities. These limitations impede 'target discovery' during development
of new covalent inhibitors. Similarly, once a specific protein target has been identified as being selectively bound
by an inhibitor-candidate of interest, it is difficult to ascertain the fraction of target molecules in a cell or tissue
that are covalently bound by the compound ('target occupancy'). Target discovery and occupancy data can be
combined with toxicology and pharmacokinetic results to build more informative risk profiles to ensure that only
the most promising drug candidates are advanced and ultimately nominated for clinical trials.
The objective of our interdisciplinary team (Justin Kim, chemistry and chemical biology; Jarrod Marto, protein
biochemistry and chemical proteomics) is to synthesize and test first-generation reagents designed to advance
covalent inhibitor target discovery and target occupancy studies. Achieving our objectives will validate our
approach and pave the way for an intensive and iterative campaign of probe synthesis paired with
chemoproteomic analysis to systematically optimize our reagents. In the fullness of time we envision a complete
suite of chemoproteomic assay-specific reagents to facilitate target discovery and target occupancy studies.
Aim 1. To optimize new bioorthogonal reagents for proteome-wide inhibitor target identification. In this
aim we will further develop our bioorthogonal chemistry and rationally expand our library of alkylating scaffolds
suitable for cysteine profiling experiments. We will systematically assess the performance of our probes for target
discovery using recently characterized covalent inhibitors of kinases and deubiquitinating enzymes.
Aim 2. To develop multiplexed reporter probes to rapidly quantify covalent inhibitor target occupancy.
We will leverage selective fragmentation of our reporter probe scaffold to develop high-sensitivity, high-through-
put targeted mass spectrometry assays to quantify the occupancy of covalent inhibitors on their primary protein
target. We will carefully assess the performance of our cysteine alkylating probes as universal reagents for pull-
down-based (PD) target occupancy analysis, including linearity, accuracy, and limits of detection/quantification.
Successful completion of our objectives will provide an initial set of reagents with an extensible framework to
support future probe optimization campaigns by us and others in the field. Collectively the output of our program
will accelerate development of new covalent drugs for cancer therapy."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The long-term goal of our proposed project is to reduce the population burden of CRC by providing the information needed to address key policy questions across the CRC control continuum in an accessible and transparent manner. To accomplish this goal we will use our population-based microsimulation models to: 1) Evaluate the impact of screening as practiced in the US; 2) Inform the debate about the increase in CRC incidence before age 50; 3) Consider the effectiveness of precision of screening and surveillance; 4) Address other emerging issues and opportunities in CRC control; and 5) Use novel methods to improve model accessibility and transparency. Our team will fill critical gaps in knowledge, enabling decision makers to act. New evidence that we will incorporate in our models to better inform CRC control opportunities will be 1) updated information on screening patterns in the US (in collaboration with the Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimen, or PROS PR), 2) data on the increased risk of CRC in persons under age 50 (in collaboration with Rebecca Siegal of the American Cancer Society, who did the seminal work in this area), and 3) state-of-the art colonoscopy screening data to incorporate alternative carcinogenesis pathways in the natural history models (in collaboration with the New Hampshire Colonoscopy Registry). We will synthesize and incorporate the growing body of evidence in the literature to assess the clinical utility of personalized screening and treatment, as well as the potential role for novel computer-aided detection and diagnosis modalities. We will expand our models to project clinical and resource-based outcomes for middle-income countries that are considering the implementation of a screening program. Lastly, there is a critical need to make our models assessible and transparent. To this end we will use high performance computing approaches to develop and apply deep-learning methods for model calibration and model emulation, which will aid in model sharing. The three participating modeling groups are well positioned to carry out this work, bringing a wealth of experience, expertise, and insight to issues related to microsimulation modeling of CRC, and have a proven track record of collaboration and disseminating our work to health policy decision makers."

Retinal degenerative (RD) diseases, such as Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Leber congenital amaurosis
(LCA), cause dysfunction and cell death of photoreceptor (PR) cells, ultimately leading to blindness. LCA
is the leading cause of inherited childhood blindness resulting in a loss of vision at or soon after birth. Though
this is considered to be quite rare, these blinding diseases are devastating for those affected. Current efforts are
being made to develop gene-therapies aimed at correcting some of the genes affected in RD and this approach
has shown some promise in animals and humans for restoring RPE65 gene expression, but there are many
other causes of RD for which there is no cure. In addition, due to the many mutations involved in RD, there are
significant gaps in our understanding of how PR loss occurs. To address this, we will use human pluripotent
stem cell (PSC) based retinal cell-reporter lines with RD-associated alleles to help explore the mechanisms of
PR cell death. Given the typically long period of time required to generate human retinas in the laboratory, the
severity and rapid onset of degeneration in LCA makes it an attractive experimental model to study human RD
and to develop potential therapies. We will study the aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein-like1 (AIPL1)
gene to explore three functional domains that harbor naturally occurring mutations in patients with LCA and
cone-rod dystrophy (CORD). A comparative analysis of different mutations might lead to a better understanding
of how rods and cones die and greater insight into other more common forms of PR degeneration, such as age-
related macular degeneration (AMD). A central hypothesis is that human PSC derived 3D retina organoids
with AIPL1 mutations will recapitulate human retinal dystrophy resulting in PR loss. This hypothesis is
supported by our recent work, and others, showing that human PSCs can be coaxed into becoming retinal
eyecup-like structures with PRs, a laminar morphology and outer segment structures that are similar to an actual
retina. This proposal will bridge two innovative technologies; (1) genome-editing to generate genetically
matched retinal reporter PSC derived retinas with disease-associated mutations and (2) gene-correction to
repair genetic defects and promote PR cell survival. Given the very early onset of LCA it is important to define
the appropriate windows of time for such treatment options. Not only will these studies lead to new insights
into the biology of RD disease, but could also provide an innovative resource to develop therapies for
the treatment of RD."

Improved linkage to and uptake of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is critical to end the HIV epidemic in the United States (US). Despite PrEP’s high efficacy, less than 20% of PrEP-eligible people have received a prescription and gaps in uptake expose regional and racial disparities. In 2018, the US South accounted for more than half of all new HIV diagnoses but only one-third of PrEP users. PrEP use in North Carolina (NC) similarly lags, with uptake lowest among young sexual and gender minority populations (YSGM) who account for nearly two-thirds of the state’s incident infections. The PrEP-to-Need ratio, which is a metric of PrEP equity that measures PrEP uptake relative to new HIV diagnoses highlights disparities in PrEP uptake among specific demographic groups such as Black, Hispanic, Southern people, and women, indicating these groups are underserved relative to their epidemic need. For newly diagnosed adolescents and adults in North Carolina in 2022, the most likely route of HIV transmission reported was male-male sex (reported by 57.8%), followed by heterosexual sex (18.7%). Among NC counties with the highest rate of HIV diagnoses, four have rural designation and nine are small or medium metropolitan areas. NC’s HIV epidemic thrives alongside rising sexually transmitted infections (STI), which are also frequently concentrated in rural areas. Despite behavioral risk overlap of incident STIs and HIV, in NC, PrEP is only offered at a few, primarily urban health department (HD) affiliated STI clinics. The lack of robust healthcare infrastructure in these areas presents challenges for HIV prevention services.  Leveraging STI clinics as an on-ramp to PrEP is an ideal opportunity to capitalize on STI service encounters and address disparities in PrEP access. A pathway to PrEP that utilizes existing clinic infrastructure to identify potential PrEP users, adapts services to ameliorate clinic constraints, and tailors PrEP engagement tools to specific client needs is a compelling strategy to improve PrEP access, uptake, and persistence in rural NC. This multilevel intervention to link PrEP and STI services, addresses barriers at policy, clinic, provider, and user levels. The strategy builds capacity and confidence via clinic training; facilitates patient handoff to navigators for linkage to financial support; and uses an evidence-based digital health platform, connecting users to peer educators, PrEP resources, and telehealth providers. The overarching objective is to parlay YSGM’s and cisgender women’s episodic STI service encounters into linkage to convenient, continuous PrEP care in NC."

Retinal degenerative (RD) diseases result in a progressive loss of vision, and have a devastating impact on a
patient’s quality of life. Many genetic factors that nucleate these diseases are intricately linked to defects in the
visual (retinoid) cycle. This cycle is necessary for regenerating the essential visual pigment 11-cis-retinal after
it is photoisomerized to all-trans-retinal; errors in this multi-step recycling of all-trans-retinal back to 11-cis-
retinal leads to the buildup of toxic retinoid photo-oxidation products that can kill photoreceptors and the
supporting retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Few therapeutic options exist for mitigating the damage that is
caused by these photo-oxidation products, especially after cell death in the retina has started to affect quality
of vision.
Normally, the vertebrate visual cycle is distributed across two distinct cell types, the retinal pigment epithelium
and the photoreceptors (i.e., rods and cones). In the functional visual cycle, 11-cis-retinal is initially bound to
opsin proteins within the photoreceptors, where it is then isomerized to all-trans-retinal in the presence of light.
This transformation initiates the phototransduction signaling cascade that travels through optic nerve to the
brain, where the signals are integrated into a coherent visual field. The all-trans-retinal molecules are then
shed by opsins and converted to all-trans-retinol by all-trans-retinal dehydrogenase. The all-trans-retinol is then
transported from the photoreceptors to one of two “helper” cell types- RPE cells that support both rod and cone
function, and Müller cells that solely support cones. Because RPE-linked visual cycle dysfunction has a greater
impact on the retina as a whole, we’ve elected to focus on just the RPE-based visual cycle and not the cone-
exclusive alternative visual cycle. When all-trans-retinol is transported from the photoreceptors to the RPE, the
all-trans-retinol undergoes two key reactions; one catalyzed by lecithin-retinol acyltransferase (abbr. Lrat), and
the other by retinal pigment epithelium-specific 65 kDa (abbr. Rpe65). Lrat catalyzes the coupling of all-trans
retinol to fatty acids, forming stable retinyl ester intermediates. These retinyl esters are subsequently
isomerized and hydrolyzed by Rpe65 to give 11-cis-retinol. 11-cis-retinol is then oxidized to 11-cis-retinal by
11-cis-retinol dehydrogenases and transported back to the photoreceptors for re-use. When the visual cycle is
hindered, all-trans retinal can build up in the photoreceptors, leading to the formation of toxic photo-oxidation
products that cause retinal degeneration.
I intend to expand our knowledge of the visual cycle via engineered expression of Lrat and Rpe65 in the
photoreceptors. In studying how manipulation of retinoid flux in the visual cycle controls the emergence and
progression of RD, we can optimize therapeutic interventions that target the central drivers of retinal disease,
while simultaneously reversing the toxic buildup of retinoids in chronic RD."

institute’s goals. Within global mental health, there is growing recognition of the gaps in understanding how to
intervene on social drivers to substantially reduce the global burden of disease attributable to mental illnesses.
This R25 application proposes a research education program on social driver interventions in global mental
health. The program, Global Mental Health Research on SoCial Drivers Of MeNtal IllNessEs aCross The
Lifespan (gmhCONNECT), is based at the University of Illinois at Chicago and George Washington University
with a large U.S. and international faculty of senior global mental health researchers. The mentorship network
also includes the people living with mental illness from the Global Mental Health Peer Network. Mentees will also
engage with practitioners from the WHO, UNICEF, UNHCR, and major humanitarian organizations. In keeping
with the requirements of PAR-20-080, this program targets graduate and health professional students, medical
residents, postdoctoral trainees, and early-career faculty who are U.S. citizens and permanent residents who
are planning to submit or currently funded through NRSAs, K awards, Fogarty Fellowships, or project grant.
Building a career in global mental health research involves mastering complex challenges including working with:
the legacies of colonialism, power differentials, local culture, agencies and officials, international and local NGOs,
and non-specialist and peer providers. The purpose of this program is to facilitate their success as independent
researchers and members of the research community in global mental health. Our program highlights
intervention research concerning how social drivers impact mental illness, prevention, and care for populations
in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and other low-resource settings. The specific aims are: Aim 1:
Provide training, primarily through a Summer Institute, which advances the trainees’ research knowledge and
skills on the ways in which social drivers impact mental illness, prevention, and care and how social drivers and
their impact can be addressed through interventions; Aim 2: Provide one-year of focused intensive mentorship
(dyadic and triadic) from a US and LMIC pool of multidisciplinary and diverse GMH experts to support the
mentees’ research interests and career trajectories. Aim 3: Provide a range of synergistic guided learning
opportunities including group mentorship, structured peer mentorship, and engagements with people living with
mental illness and practitioners at implementing organizations, which will enable trainees to form their unique
mentoring networks; Aim 4: Evaluate the impact of gmhCONNECT on the mentee’s networks, knowledge and
productivity, with an emphasis on equity and collaboration when evaluating productivity metrics. Successful
implementation of these aims will provide promising early-career scientists with more support for their research,
an increased success rate, accelerated time for acquiring NIH funding, and generate more equitable and
scientifically-rigorous collaborative global mental health research."

PARP inhibitors (PARPi) hold tremendous therapeutic potential because of their selectivity for cells lacking
functional BRCA1, BRCA2, and other homology-directed repair (HDR) genes. However, as with other targeted
therapies, resistance to PARPi frequently arises, underscoring the unmet need to elucidate how PARPi cause
cell death in BRCA mutant but not normal cells. Individual PARPi may act through distinct mechanisms, either
by “trapping” PARP-DNA complexes, or by inhibiting repair of single-stranded (ssDNA) nicks that are
subsequently converted to double-stranded breaks (DSBs). Moreover, patients may exhibit differential drug
sensitivity depending on the specific causative BRCA gene mutation. Defining this fundamental landscape will
be critical to better predict responders/non-responders as well as the durability of patient response to PARPi.
Historically, a detailed, mechanistic study of how mutations in BRCA2 influence genome integrity has been
hampered by the immense challenge of manipulating and purifying this large protein. Recently, we have
overcome these challenges, allowing us to leverage a combination of in vitro biochemical assays and cellular
assays to pinpoint how individual pathogenic or targeted mutations influence specific functionalities including:
DNA binding, replication fork protection, RAD51 nucleoprotein filament formation, and RAD51-mediated DNA
strand invasion. In addition to applying these techniques to interrogate the explicit biochemical function(s)
compromised by pathogenic BRCA2 mutations, we will assess sensitivity to PARPi with strong, intermediate,
or weak trapping activity (e.g. Talazoparib, Olaparib, and Veliparib, respectively). Lastly, we will investigate the
function(s) reconstituted by “reversion” mutations identified in patients with PARPi-resistant tumors, which may
independently identify functional attributes necessary for PARPi sensitivity. Our long-term goal is to unveil the
molecular consequences of PARPi treatment that necessitate processing by BRCA2, RAD51, and other HDR
proteins. Our central hypothesis is that by elucidating how BRCA2 and RAD51 mechanistically overcome
PARPi-mediated toxicity, we will provide the necessary framework to understand how PARPi resistance can
develop in patients. Our hypothesis is based on compelling preliminary data illustrating the specific functions
of BRCA2 and RAD51 in response to PARPi. Thus, our rationale, to reveal the mechanism(s) that underlie
PARPi-mediated toxicity, will vertically advance knowledge surrounding the HDR response to PARPi, and
ultimately, improve clinical management of BRCA patients. In aim 1, we will utilize patient derived BRCA2
reversion alleles in our isogenic human cell models to interrogate what specific function(s) have been
“reactivated” to promote resistance to PARPi. In aim 2, we will determine how BRCA2 and RAD51 catalyze
the removal or bypass of PARPi trapped lesions using purified proteins and relevant model DNA substrates
(reversed forks, gaps) in reconstituted biochemical assays. Our approach is innovative because of our unique
skill set and development of robust cell-based and biochemical functional assays to dissect HDR mechanisms
focused on BRCA2 and RAD51. Our objective in the current work will be to apply our HDR expertise to solve a
long-standing mystery in the PARPi field: to reveal how HDR proficient cells effectively survive treatment. The
results are anticipated to have a positive impact on the clinical management of HDR deficient tumors as
therapeutic resistance and relapse are critical barriers to the successful treatment of patients."

Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is a key lipid-signaling molecule that regulates a vast array of
biological activities. However, the function of PIP2-regulated signaling in mammalian cell-fate decision and
tumorigenesis has received less attention. Research from our laboratory indicates that an endosome-localized
PIP2 producing enzyme, type I gamma phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase i5 (PIPKIγi5), is crucial for the
regulation of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Hippo signaling, two essential signaling pathways
in the control of cell proliferation and Cancer Stem Cell (CSC) regeneration. The dysregulation of EGFR or
Hippo signaling has been found in many types of cancers including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC). Here is the current hypothesis: By interacting with the small GTPase Rab7a, PIPKIγi5 modulates
EGFR endosomal trafficking and degradation; By interacting with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Neuronal precursor
cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 4 (NEDD4), PIPKIγi5 controls the stability of Hippo pathway
core components WW45 and LATS2; Via modulating the EGFR and Hippo signaling, PIPKIγi5 controls
HNSCC CSC regeneration, tumorigenesis, and metastasis. Aim 1 will characterize the PIPKIγi5-Rab7a
interaction and determine whether this interaction controls EGFR signaling by modulating endosome
maturation. Aim 1 will also demonstrate whether PIPKIγi5 controls the Hippo core components WW45/LATS2
ubiquitination and degradation by associating with NEDD4. In Aim 2, both in vitro cell line models and in vivo
xenograft mouse models will be used to determine the effects of PIPKIγi5 on HNSCC CSC self-renewal and
metastasis. Furthermore, Aim 2 will further validate the function of PIPKIγi5 in HNSCC tumorigenesis by using
PIPKIγi5-knockout mouse models. The successful completion of this application will reveal a novel PIP2-
regulated pathway that controls HNSCC progression by modulating EGFR and Hippo signaling."

ABSTRACT
Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring
System (CNMI PRAMS) will be a joint research project between the Commonwealth Healthcare
Corporation (CHCC) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The project
involves the development and completion of a protocol and implementation of a population-
based surveillance system designed to identify maternal attitudes and experiences before,
during and after pregnancy. Research indicates that maternal behaviors during pregnancy
impact infant birthweight, gestation and mortality rates. The CNMI PRAMS will strengthen
capacity in the CNMI to produce high quality data not available from other sources relating to
pregnancy and the first few months after birth and enable the monitoring of maternal and infant
health indicators over time. The goal of CNMI PRAMS is to identify maternal risk behaviors that
may affect both maternal and infant health. Findings from CNMI PRAMS will be used to
enhance the understanding of maternal behaviors among the territory’s diverse population and
their relationship with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The CNMI CHCC will use PRAMS
surveillance data for program planning and evaluation and influencing public health practice and
policy for maternal and child health programs.

Approximately one out of three 2- to 5-year-old children in the United States has experienced caries (tooth
decay). The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry and American Academy of Pediatrics provide
recommendations for preventive strategies, and recognize that infant, toddler and early childhood oral health is
one of the foundations upon which preventive education and dental care must be built to enhance the opportunity
for a lifetime free from preventable oral disease. Parents struggle to adopt these preventive strategies at the
same time that challenging behaviors emerge in children’s psychological development. This combination can
make it very difficult to build the foundation of oral health practices that the AAPD recommends. There is a strong
body of evidence supporting the use of behavioral parenting strategies in dealing with child behavioral problems.
The proposed project introduces behavioral parent training strategies in concert with efforts to address other
known parental barriers to provide an effective vehicle to promote oral health with a universal prevention
intervention.
A private/public collaboration between Oregon Research Behavioral Intervention Strategies, Oregon Research
Institute & Oregon Community Foundation leveraged resources and competencies to create a prototype of a
commercially viable coordinated oral health prevention intervention program, BeReady2Smile (BR2S). The
program promotes dental health and targets parents of young children attending parenting education classes
and families receiving home visiting services through Head Start. The innovation in the effort was to introduce
behavioral parent training strategies, in concert with efforts to address other known parental barriers, to provide
an effective vehicle for promoting dental health with a universal prevention intervention. The program includes a
video that can be shown in parenting education classes to engage parents on oral health and a mobile/web
application to drive behavioral change. This Phase II project builds on that work and on a successful Phase I
pilot by providing professional development tools to prepare parenting educators to use BeReady2Smile in both
parenting group and home visit settings. The goal of this proposal is to complete development and evaluate
our technology-based professional development tool, BeReady2Smile_ProD, within an RCT. The
program has great potential for sustainability and cost-effectiveness for the distal training of Parenting
Educators using both Home-based and Group-based delivery methodologies. The long-term goal of the
program is to help parents provide the foundation for a lifetime free from preventable oral disease."

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a debilitating condition that represents a significant public health
burden. Current treatments are ineffective for many patients because they require lifelong
adherence to a strict medication regimen to be effective. Thus, there is an urgent need to
develop new treatments for OUD in which a single treatment can confer long-lasting protection.
Here we propose to test an innovative new chemogenetic strategy to achieve this by
suppressing opioid-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, one of the main
mechanisms underlying OUD. In Aim 1, we test whether using adeno-associated viral vectors to
express a novel chemogenetic receptor in the brain can suppress opioid-induced dopamine
release. In Aim 2, we will test whether this approach can selectively reduce opioid consumption
without affecting other behaviors. In Aim 3, we will test whether this approach can extinguish
opioid consumption in animals with a previous history of opioid self-administration. We
anticipate that this study will provide the proof-of-concept necessary to continue with further
refinement of this technology, with the long-term goal of developing a one-time treatment that
can confer lifelong protection against OUD."

Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are a growing population of immunocompromised patients at increased
risk for infection. Bacterial bloodstream infections (BSI) are common, affecting approximately 26% of SOT
recipients after transplant. Mortality from BSI can reach up to 50% in SOT patients when accompanied with
septic shock. The host immune response is believed to play a pivotal role in determining clinical outcomes from
an infection in a SOT recipient, the details of which are poorly understood. Identifying immunologic biosignatures
that portend prognostic information will lend biological insight into the mechanisms of maladaptive immune
responses to BSI. I will use existing biological specimens from SOT recipients with BSI to test my overarching
hypothesis that serum levels of cytokines, chemokines, immunoglobulin (IG), and differential gene expression
profiles are associated with clinical severity of infection in SOT patients with bacterial BSI. The Specific Aims
of this proposal are: Aim 1: Identify cytokine, chemokine, and IG biomarkers of septic shock and 30-day mortality
among SOT recipients with BSI. Aim 2: Determine differential gene expression profiles and genetic pathways
associated with septic shock and 30-day mortality in SOT patients with BSI. Aim 3A: Use immunologic
biosignatures to develop a prognostic model for SOT patients with BSI. Aim 3B: Externally validate and refine
the prognostic model using samples I will prospectively collect from SOT patients with BSI at Emory Transplant
Center. I expect that completion of these Aims and related training will lead to a better understanding of how the
host immune response influences outcomes in SOT patients during BSI. This information will directly inform
future studies aimed at evaluating immunomodulatory treatment strategies to optimize outcomes of SOT patients
with BSI. My long-term career goal is to become an independent physician scientist leading a team dedicated
to improving outcomes in SOT recipients with bacterial infections. To facilitate my success in completing the
Specific Aims, proposed training, and transition to a new institution, I have assembled an experienced team of
mentors and advisors dedicated to training the next generation of physician scientists. Emory University School
of Medicine is an ideal research environment for my proposal and training. As home to one of the nation’s top
transplant centers, Emory is a highly collaborative research environment equipped with rich resources and
national leaders in biomedical research. Therefore, I will be well positioned for success in developing the
expertise and preliminary data necessary to compete for an NIH R01."
10807683,"Neurologic symptoms are among the most common post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). Recent
studies show that there is a very high rate of neurocognitive changes among Veterans surviving acute COVID-
19 infection. The long-term neurocognitive changes of this infection could be even worse and remains
incompletely characterized. Moreover, neurological sequelae have been considered the most disabling of the
long-term complications. Possible mechanisms of neuronal damage from SARS CoV-2 infection include direct
viral CNS invasion through the cribriform plate or hematogenous route, or retrograde neuronal dissemination,
or indirect injury mediated by systemic inflammation, and secondary degenerative mechanisms. Whether
neurocognitive changes can be predicted by biomarkers – or imaging evidence of – inflammation, neuronal
damage or disruption of blood brain barrier has never been evaluated in a well-characterized cohort.
Furthermore, no treatment strategies exist at present, but preliminary data suggests that antivirals may prevent
the occurrence of cognitive impairment in PASC.
VHA has established a nationwide COVID-19 cohort early in the pandemic. This objective of this cohort –
called Epidemiology, Immunology and Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 (EPIC3) – is to characterize the
natural history, clinical outcomes, and the development of immunity while also gathering biospecimens for
future study as questions emerge about this new pathogen. We will leverage the data and samples from this
study to compare participants who received antivirals during their acute COVID-19 illness with those who did
not, by 1) conducting longitudinal cognitive assessments of participants of EPIC3 and characterize trajectories
of cognitive changes, using a novel tablet-based tool; 2) carrying out detailed longitudinal analyses of
biomarkers of neuronal damage, neurodegeneration and blood-brain barrier disruption or participants with and
without COVID-19, and 3) performing advanced structural and functional imaging of a subset of these
participants. We will then correlate biomarkers and imaging findings to the presence, degree and trajectories
of neurocognitive changes in COVID-19 patients who did and did not receive antivirals. We have assembled a
multidisciplinary team with expertise critical to answering the challenging questions posed by neurocognitive
changes of PASC.
Expected findings of our study will have immediate clinical impact: 1) they will establish whether PASC is an
additional goal for antiviral therapy, 2) they will establish a benchmark for standardized, validated assessment
of possible neurocognitive changes in patients with COVID-19; this will provide a basis for future interventions
and management guidelines; 2) determine whether these cognitive changes could be predicted or monitored
using well validated biomarkers of neuronal damage and/or blood-brain barrier disruption; 3) determine
whether structural and function brain imaging could assist in further studies of mechanisms of neuronal
damage and/or neurocognitive dysfunction from COVID-19 infection.
Here we propose addressing current gaps in our understanding of cognitive function in PASC by following the
trajectories of cognitive function over three years using validated, tablet-based neuropsychological tests,
analyzing the relationship between co-morbidities prevalent amongst veterans such as PTSD and depressive
disorders and cognitive impairment following COVID-19. This study will link key neurological and
immunological markers, clinical outcomes, and imaging of cerebral blood flow and demyelination, thereby
contributing a cohesive understanding of the mechanisms of neurological injury."

The clinical high-risk (CHR) or “prodromal” framework has provided a platform for tracking the onset of psychosis
and identifying the neurodevelopmental mechanisms of risk for this disorder. It is now well established, however,
that affective symptoms in CHR samples are essentially universal, persist longitudinally, and contribute to
disability regardless of psychosis transition. Given the substantial neurobiological proximity of psychotic and
affective disorders, the extent to which current biomarkers in CHR reflect risk for psychosis, common affective
illness, or both remains largely unknown. Broadening the scope of detection to the early affective stages has
potential to strengthen pathogenic models of psychosis by highlighting shared and unique vulnerability
mechanisms while informing treatments that are relevant to a wider range of individuals. This study will identify
shared and differential impairments of stress and reward processing among youth with psychosis-risk syndromes
or early-stage depression (ESD). In a task-based fMRI design, youth with CHR, ESD, or no psychopathology
will complete a probabilistic reinforcement learning paradigm before and after an acute stress manipulation.
Using an established computational model we will generate estimates of theoretically relevant learning
parameters, compare them across groups, and relate them to neural and hormonal data. We hypothesize that
the striatum represents a shared locus of reward-based dysfunction across the early and high-risk stages of
psychosis and depression, but risk-specific differences may lie within the prefrontal cortex. The results of this
study will represent a significant step forward in our transdiagnostic understanding of emerging psychopathology,
with implications for both generalizable and personalized intervention. By the end of the project period I will have
established expertise in task-based fMRI research, independence in computational modeling of behavior, and
expert knowledge of the interplay between stress, reward, and neurodevelopment across mood and psychotic
disorders. Together this will provide a unique combination of clinical and methodological expertise and prepare
me for my long-term goal of improving preventative intervention through longitudinal research."

10799192,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Human genetic investigations have nominated hundreds of novel genomic loci harboring genes that influence a
range of cardiovascular (CV) diseases and their risk factors, including plasma lipids. However, only a fraction of
these novel loci have been investigated to determine the causal genes and underlying molecular mechanisms
leading to increased risk of—or protection from—CV disease. While LDL reduction is effective in reducing risk
of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, other common cardiovascular diseases such as peripheral arterial
disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and aortic stenosis have no effective non-surgical medical therapies.
Importantly, a growing body of human genetic data has identified that even beyond CAD, these additional CV
diseases have significant genetic associations with genomic loci/genes/variants that are also associated with
plasma lipid traits. This research program is focused on a systematic approach to fill some of the major gaps in
knowledge that link these human genomic loci to new biology, disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic
targets. The goal is to provide a roadmap for how the hundreds of novel loci/genes/variants associated with CVD
might ultimately be investigated in an efficient manner. The focus will be on genes associated with both plasma
lipid traits and at least one major cardiovascular disease. Due to the liver’s primary role in lipid and lipoprotein
metabolism, the investigators will target liver-expressed genes. Furthermore, they will leverage naturally-
occurring protein-coding variation in genes that influence plasma lipids and CVD in order to gain greater insight
into the structure-function relationships of these proteins and relationship to phenotypes. This is an ambitious
program of research with two major Research Foci: Focus 1: Interrogation of novel putatively causal genes at
loci associated with both lipid traits and CV disease. Through systematic data ingestion and analyses of large-
scale GWAS and sequencing data, the study team will generate (and refine) a prioritized list of liver-expressed
genes at loci significantly associated with plasma lipids and at least one CV disease. Cell-based and murine
model systems will be used, accompanied by human studies, to validate causal genes and gain insight into the
physiological and molecular mechanisms by which they exert their influence. Focus 2: Leveraging protein-coding
variants to provide insight into structure-function properties of proteins influencing lipid traits and CV disease.
Through systematic analyses of large-scale public and private genomic data linked to phenotypes, the
investigators will develop a prioritized list of novel protein-coding variants associated with lipids and CVD and
perform comparative functional studies in model systems and in human carriers. The outcome of these studies
is expected to establish a firm biological basis for a substantial number of novel genes/proteins and protein-
coding variants that influence plasma lipoprotein metabolism and CV disease. The intent is to establish a
paradigm by which novel genes/variants associated with NHLBI-related phenotypes can be efficiently validated
and rapidly provided to the broader scientific community for further investigation."

changes in clinical guidelines to less aggressive interventions. There is a critical need to identify the minority of
patients with in increasing incidence of aggressive disease, while minimizing over-treatment in those patients
with indolent PTC. Despite the public health impact thyroid nodule disease, few data exist on the impact of our
clinical strategies and conducting clinical trials in this population is prohibitively time-consuming and costly.
 Our overarching goals are to enhance the health and minimize harm to the large number of patients with
thyroid nodules. The specific objective of this proposal is to harness a comprehensive computer model
to simulate individuals with benign and malignant nodules in the U.S. population to identify optimal
personalized treatment approaches. This proposal builds on three tenets:
 First, contemporary research considers thyroid cancer in isolation from the more common benign nodular
disease, missing the impact of the morbidity and cost associated with identifying those cancers. Secondly,
there is a direct correlation between screening and diagnosis of thyroid cancer. It is imperative to consider the
underlying reservoir of disease when assessing the effects of potential diagnostic and surveillance strategies.
Lastly, while recent shifts in practice have been towards less aggressive management to minimize over-
treatment, there is the potential to miss small, potentially lethal, thyroid cancer subtypes.
 The applicant is an Early Stage Investigator with expertise in thyroid nodular disease. Our team of a
multidisciplinary group of experts, including decision scientists and statisticians will refine and expand on our
mathematical model that simulates the pre-clinical course of both benign and malignant thyroid nodules (Aim
1) to identify the effectiveness of diagnostic biomarkers to guide treatment strategies (Aim 2) and assess the
impact of risk-stratified surveillance approaches to patients with both thyroid nodular disease (Aim 3).
 Successful completion of the aims will inform our understanding of the health and economic consequences
of our current clinical practices in the treatment of patients with thyroid nodular disease. Ultimately, we will
identify patient management strategies that will identify aggressive disease while reducing morbidity both from
recurrent disease and ineffective medical and surgical interventions."

 Most youth who experience significant trauma-related symptoms do not receive indicated services and,
when they do, the services received are not evidence-based. The education sector is responsible for 70-80%
of all mental health services delivered to youth, but there are (1) a limited menu of evidence-based treatments
(EBTs) for trauma available for use in schools and (2) a need to enhance the uptake and use of EBT in schools
and other community settings for youth exposed to trauma.
 Trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy (TF-CBT) is an efficacious treatment for trauma-exposed
youth, but there are no studies that have evaluated the effectiveness of TF-CBT when delivered in schools.
Additionally, significant implementation barriers limit the successful adoption, delivery with fidelity, and
sustainment of TF-CBT; especially individual clinician variables, such as beliefs and attitudes surrounding core
components of the intervention (e.g., exposure to feared stimuli). These two gaps reveal the need for research
that simultaneously examines effectiveness and implementation of TF-CBT when delivered in schools.
 Individual provider behavior change is a critical component of successful implementation of any EBT. Even
when factors such as evidence-informed policy, supportive leadership, and effective training are in place,
implementation ultimately rests with providers’ motivation and commitment to change. The Beliefs and
Attitudes for Successful Implementation in Schools (BASIS) intervention is a facilitated, group-based blended
implementation strategy. BASIS is brief, pragmatic, and is designed to augment standard EBP training and
consultation procedures. It targets theoretically-derived individual-level determinants associated with behavior
change using motivational and volitional behavior change strategies. BASIS has been rated as feasible and
appropriate by SBMH clinicians, and found to increase clinicians’ attitudes, perceptions of social norms, and
implementation intentions to use EBT in a small (n = 24) randomized trial (R21MH108714).
 Considering the need to examine the effectiveness of TF-CBT in the context of schools and the importance
of individual-level strategies that augment EBT training and consultation, the current proposal is a hybrid type 2
effectiveness-implementation trial with 120 SBMH clinicians and 480 students using mixed methods. This
project is designed to simultaneously test the effectiveness of TF-CBT in schools and the impact of BASIS on
proximal mechanisms and TF-CBT implementation outcomes. Specifically, the proposal aims to experimentally
evaluate TF-CBT in schools versus treatment as usual, including intervention mechanisms of change, mental
health outcomes, and TF-CBT cost-effectiveness (Aim 1); and experimentally evaluate BASIS versus and
attention control, including implementation mechanisms of change, TF-CBT implementation outcomes, and
BASIS cost-effectiveness (Aim 2). TF-CBT and BASIS represent potentially robust and generalizable
strategies for greatly enhancing the accessibility and quality of services for trauma-exposed youth."

Acute and chronic parenchymal lung diseases, such as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Therapies are limited,
largely due to our incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis. These diseases arise from injury to the
alveolar epithelium with ineffectual regeneration. In accordance with the NIH mission to “seek fundamental
knowledge about the nature…of living systems and apply that knowledge to enhance health”, we aim to identify
mechanisms by which alveolar homeostasis is maintained, disrupted during injury, and restored during
physiologic regeneration and how these processes go awry in the pathogenesis of ARDS and IPF.
The normal alveolus consists of alveolar type 2 epithelial cells (AEC2s) and AEC1s, which form a tight barrier,
with quiescent fibroblasts and alveolar macrophages. The molecular mechanisms of cell-cell crosstalk that
maintain alveolar quiescence during homeostasis are poorly understood. During lung injury, AECs die. Severe
acute injury results in barrier permeability, leading to ARDS; clinical recovery requires epithelial regeneration. In
IPF, repetitive epithelial injury with impaired regeneration begets fibrosis. However, the mechanisms underlying
physiologic regeneration and how it is impaired in the pathogenesis of IPF are incompletely understood.
AEC2s are the primary progenitor responsible for physiologic alveolar regeneration. AEC2s proliferate, then
differentiate into AEC1s. We and others have identified mechanisms of AEC2 proliferation. Moreover, we were
the first to identify a novel transitional cell state transiently assumed by regenerating AEC2s before differentiating
into AEC1s. We also found that transitional cells persist in pulmonary fibrosis, suggesting that persistence of
transitional cells may be the critical regenerative defect driving fibrosis. However, the mechanisms that induce
AEC2s to assume the transitional state and transitional cells to differentiate into AEC1s during physiologic
regeneration and by which transitional cells persist and promote fibrosis in IPF are unknown.
Here, we will explore the mechanisms of alveolar cell-cell crosstalk that maintain homeostasis and promote
physiologic regeneration and how these mechanisms go awry in ARDS and fibrosis. We will use lineage tracing
combined with AEC2-specific inducible gene knockout in mouse models of homeostasis, injury, physiologic
regeneration, and fibrosis. Cultured human and murine AECs will be used to dissect mechanism. The proposed
work will fill fundamental gaps in our understanding of alveolar homeostasis and physiologic and
pathologic regeneration and overcome critical barriers to the development of novel therapies for ARDS
and IPF. The funding will also support the pursuit of new lines of investigation and the dedication of appropriate
time and energy into collaborations, professional service, and mentorship."

This is a proposal for a K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research for Ami A. Shah, MD,
MHS of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Dr. Shah is an Associate Professor of Medicine in the
Division of Rheumatology, Deputy Director for the Rheumatology Precision Medicine Centers of Excellence
clinical programs, and Co-Director of the Johns Hopkins Scleroderma Center. Dr. Shah has spent the majority
of her career and scholarship focused on patient-oriented research in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) and in
investigating the relationship between cancer and autoimmunity. Scleroderma is a complex, multisystem
rheumatic disease that manifests very differently among patients with the same diagnosis. There is heterogeneity
in symptoms, trajectory of disease, timing of events, and response to therapy. While many risk factors have been
identified for specific scleroderma complications at the population level, these have not been easily translatable
to clinical practice at the patient level. This has been due to many factors including difficulty (i) capturing
multivariate patient-specific disease trajectories, (ii) modeling the complex interplay between organ system
parameters over time, and (iii) utilizing knowledge gained from trajectories of other patients who share
scleroderma subgroup characteristics. In this proposal, the applicant seeks to harness rich clinical data through
the Johns Hopkins precision medicine platform and develop novel computational methods to generate
personalized risk estimates of major clinical events in scleroderma. She will utilize an innovative strategy to apply
and test these new insights in a clinical setting. By embedding estimated trajectories and probabilities of major
events into a patient level data visualization tool that updates in “real-time,” she will test whether these new
discoveries can influence provider risk estimation and future diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making. Lastly,
she will utilize phenotypic trajectories as a platform to identify candidate biomarkers at baseline that associate
with long-term disease progression in scleroderma, as this may provide insight into patient subgroups who could
benefit from intensive screening and treatment strategies. These aims will serve as an outstanding vehicle for
career development and growth for Dr. Shah’s mentees, opening new fields of inquiry and developing novel
precision medicine approaches in scleroderma."

Meiosis couples one round of DNA replication, high-frequency recombination between homologs, and two
rounds of chromosome segregation to produce haploid meiotic products. Meiotic recombination is required for
the proper segregation of homologs in meiosis, and it generates genetic diversity required for the process of
natural selection. Interestingly, meiotic recombination is clustered at “hotspots” that regulate its frequency
distribution throughout the genome. Our model system, fission yeast, led to the discovery that discrete DNA
sequence motifs and their binding proteins position the initiation of recombination at hotspots. They do so by
inducing histone PTMs and nucleosome displacement, which promote locally the catalysis of recombination-
initiating dsDNA breaks by the basal recombination machinery (Spo11/Rec12 complex). The general, DNA site-
dependent mechanisms are conserved between species that diverged about 400 million years ago and are
implicated by association to be even more broadly conserved. Remarkably, a screen of short, randomized DNA
sequences generated by base-pair substitutions in the fission yeast genome—which directly analyzed rates of
meiotic recombination in about 46,000 independent clones—identified 202 distinct, short DNA sequence
elements that activate recombination hotspots. These striking findings suggest the most meiotic recombination,
like most transcription, is positioned and regulated by discrete DNA sites and their binding proteins. However,
only five of the 202 hotspot-activating DNA sequences have been defined functionally at single-nucleotide
resolution, and the binding/activator proteins have only been identified for three of the DNA sites. Our long-term
goal is to define systematically the discrete DNA sites and binding/activator protein codes of meiotic
recombination. First, we will use a newly developed tool called “targeted forward genetics” (TFG), which can
generate more than 100,000 independent allele replacements in a single experiment, to define at single-
nucleotide resolution the discrete DNA sequence motifs required for hotspot activity in vivo. Second, we will use
an approach called “DNA affinity capture with mass spectrometry” (DAC-MS), coupled with a tandem mass
tagging (TMT), triple-stage mass spectrometry (MS3) strategy that can analyze many samples simultaneously,
to identify the candidate binding/activator proteins. Candidates will be validated for DNA site-specific binding
and hotspot activation in vivo. Third, we shall test the hypothesis that the different cis-acting regulatory modules
each promote recombination via a common downstream mechanism that involves chromatin remodeling. This
systematic, multifaceted approach will provide new insight into the mechanisms (and discrete codes) that
position meiotic recombination, which has implications for the etiology of meiotic aneuploidies (e.g., Down's
syndrome), for linkage mapping, and for the evolutionary dynamics of genomes."

 At least one-third of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) do not respond appropriately to
existing therapies and conventional agents remain limited by an increased risk of infection or malignancy, anti-
drug antibodies, and high cost. Recent evidence now suggests that the exacerbated inflammatory response
observed in IBD is initiated and maintained by loss of gut epithelial integrity with an ensuing dysbiosis and
accompanying bacterial translocation and invasion. Crucial to the maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity, as
well as gut microbial homeostasis and protection from pathogenic microorganisms is the mucosal immune
system. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is an essential regulator of the gut immune system and mediates
processes, including the expression of IL-22, which are responsible for gut tissue integrity, epithelial repair, and
microbial homeostasis. We have recently discovered a new class of highly potent and drug-like AHR agonists
derived from an indole-pyridine scaffold, which are suitable for oral administration and display promising
pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics profiles. In this proposal we intend to:
(1) Determine the modes of action of first-generation AHR agonists based on an indole-pyridine scaffold
in complementary models of gut barrier dysfunction. In the first phase of our investigations, we will define
the extent to which first-generation drug candidates mediate intestinal repair by modulating either the mucosal
immune response or through a direct effect on the epithelium in complementary mouse models of enteritis. In the
second phase, the ability of lead drug candidates to enhance intestinal integrity will be further evaluated using
primary gut organoids, as well as through the use of gut organoid/immune cell co-culture models.
(2) Design of intestine-selective AHR agonists with limited systemic exposure. We believe that design
strategies that limit systemic activation of AHR will further enhance the safety profile of this important class of
compounds. Our established lead compounds will be used as parent structures to explore the incorporation of
substituents, as well as the design of antedrugs, which reduce systemic exposure. The druggable chemical
space will be defined to ensure successful identification of gut-selective AHR agonists that display preferential
activation of AHR in intestinal tissue with limited systemic exposure. We will confirm IL-22 induction in human T
cells from healthy adults and adults with active IBD.
(3) Characterize the effectiveness of intestine-selective AHR agonists in murine models of gut barrier
dysfunction. Defining the therapeutic efficacy of intestine-selective AHR agonists for the prevention and
treatment of IBD will be focus of the initial phase of these studies. Compound efficacy will be assessed in
additional complementary murine models of enteritis in both prevention and intervention protocols. We will
subsequently determine the safety profile, including genotoxicity, off-target selectivity, and dose-dependent
toxicity for lead gut-selective compounds, which demonstrate significant in vivo potency and efficacy."

Perception and cognition arise from the coordinated activity of large networks of neurons spanning diverse brain
areas. Understanding their emergent behavior requires large-scale activity measurements both within and across
regions, ideally at single cell resolution. An integrative understanding of brain dynamics requires cellular-scale
data across sensory, motor, and executive areas spanning more than a centimeter. In addition, functional
interactions between brain areas vary with motivational state and behavioral goals, making data from freely
moving animals particularly critical. Thus, a key goal is the ability to measure activity across the full extent of
cortex at cellular resolution as animals engage in complex, cognitively demanding behaviors. However,
conventional fluorescence microscopy techniques cannot meet the joint requirements of FOV, resolution, and
miniaturization. Here, we propose a Computational Miniature Mesoscope (CM2) that will enable cortex-
wide, cellular resolution Ca2+ imaging in freely behaving mice. The premise is that computational imaging
leverages advanced algorithms to overcome limitations of conventional optics and significantly expand imaging
capabilities. In our proof-of-principle system, we demonstrated single-shot 3D imaging across an 8x7mm2 FOV
and 7µm resolution in scattering phantoms (Sci. Adv. 2020), and achieved single-cell resolution on histological
sections. Our wearable prototype has now demonstrated visualization of sensory-driven neural activity across
the 4x4mm2 main olfactory bulb in both head-fixed and freely moving mice. In this project we will: (Aim 1)
advance CM2 hardware to achieve cortex-wide cellular resolution imaging. We will validate the hardware
improvement on both phantoms and in vivo experiments. (Aim 2) Develop scattering-informed deep learning for
fast and robust recovery of neural signals. We will validate the algorithm on in vivo experiments and benchmark
against tabletop 1P and 2P measurements. (Aim 3) Cortex-wide, cellular-resolution Ca2+ imaging during social
recognition in freely behaving mice. We will use CM2 to investigate the cross-area, network-scale activity
dynamics that guide social interactions between familiar partners - one of the most integrative, multi-sensory,
and cognitively demanding forms of neural processing. IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH: This work will establish
powerful enabling technology that greatly expands the scale of activity measurements possible in behaving
animals, providing access to a wide range of questions about distributed cortical function. As a focused
application, we will test the neural signatures of individual recognition during social behavior. We anticipate that
our approach can be extended to a broader range of biological questions such as navigation, short- and long-
term memory storage, and can potentially lead to new strategies for characterizing the disruptions in neural
function that occur in psychiatric disease and neurodegenerative disorders."

Amidst the rapidly growing body of evidence regarding risks and outcomes associated with coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19), many knowledge gaps persist. We and others have reported on how certain comorbidities,
including cardiovascular risk factors, predispose some individuals more than others to the severest forms of
COVID-19 illness. The natural history, diversity, and determinants of end-organ sequelae following COVID-19
illness remain unknown. Extending beyond lung injury, accumulating data have highlighted not only short-term
but also potentially long-term adverse effects involving the heart. In fact, multiple reports have indicated a high
prevalence of subclinical as well as clinical abnormalities in cardiac structure and function seen among patients
recovering from even mild cases of COVID-19 illness. Based on the emerging evidence and our own clinical
experience to date, we hypothesize that SARS-Cov-2 provokes a systemic immune-inflammatory response that
leads to under-recognized myocardial disease in a large proportion of infected individuals – in a manner that
persists over time and represents elevated risk for the longer-term post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. Thus, we
propose to expand the application of novel cardiac imaging methods to comprehensively characterize the post-
infectious cardiac effects of COVID-19. Our specific aims are: (1) to identify and characterize the longitudinal
trajectories of cardiac disease and associated outcomes following the post-acute phase of COVID-19 illness;
and, (2) to characterize the longitudinal trajectories of immune-inflammatory response to COVID-19 illness, and
their relations with post-infectious cardiac disease and associated outcomes. From our growing source sample
of >12,500 hospitalized treated since 3/8/2020 for rt-PCR confirmed positive or negative COVID-19 status, we
will prospectively enroll COVID-19 positive patients (cases) representing the spectrum of COVID-19 illness
severity; we will simultaneously enroll hospitalized COVID-19 negative patients (controls) matched on age, sex,
ethnicity/race, comorbidities, and illness severity. We will use serial multi-modality imaging to characterize
trajectories of persistent cardiac disease versus functional and structural recovery over time. We will also use
advanced high-throughput mass spectrometry methods to serially profile bioactive lipid eicosanoids, which are
recognized as upstream molecular mediators of the systemic immune-inflammatory response to stress (including
COVID-19). We will relate eicosanoid measures with trajectories of post-infectious cardiac disease persistence
versus recovery. For significant associations, will examine heterogeneity in trajectories by sex, age,
race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and host-environment modifiers."

Adolescent relationship abuse (ARA), defined as physical, psychological, cyber, sexual abuse, or stalking in
the context of a teen dating relationship, is pervasive and associated with myriad negative health outcomes for
youth. Parental monitoring of adolescents’ interpersonal relationships and activities is a powerful and
modifiable protective factor to prevent ARA. Promising parent-adolescent interventions have emerged;
however, some implementation challenges may exist particularly with recruiting and retaining parents. A
potentially important setting to engaging parents and adolescents in ARA prevention is pediatric primary care,
as parents accompany adolescents to annual well-child visits. Our team conducted interviews with 60
adolescents, parents, and healthcare providers who stated ARA is not currently discussed during well-child
visits and an intervention around this topic is needed for primary care settings. However, a recent systematic
review of sexual health and ARA interventions in primary care identified only one effective program focused on
ARA, which was designed for older adolescents in school-based health centers and has no content around
parental monitoring. Our goal for this R21 proposal is to first develop a brief ARA prevention intervention for
middle-school aged adolescents (11 to 15) and their parents for the pediatric primary care setting and then
conduct a pilot trial with parent-adolescent dyads. We will use the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation
Model of Behavioral change (COM-B) to guide intervention development, which describes how capability
(knowledge about dating/ARA, self-efficacy to prevent ARA), opportunity (opportunity to engage in dating/ARA
parental monitoring, resource utilization), and motivation (interest/desire to engage in dating/ARA parental
monitoring) drive behavioral change. In Aim 1, guided by a community collaborative, we will use an intervention
mapping approach to develop a provider-delivered ARA prevention intervention to be implemented within
pediatric primary care settings. Informed by Aim 1 results, we will conduct a pilot trial with 55 parent-adolescent
dyads within 4 pediatric primary care clinic sites, with the primary outcomes of assessing trial feasibility and
intervention acceptability. Secondary exploratory outcomes will be: 1) behavioral change objectives pre and
post (1, 6 months) intervention through parent and adolescent surveys; and 2) implementation barriers and
facilitators using Proctor’s implementation outcomes framework through parent, adolescent, and provider
interviews. This proposal leverages a multidisciplinary team of violence prevention and family-based
intervention experts, as well as violence prevention leaders from Futures Without Violence and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. Results from this study will inform a future R01 proposal to conduct a fully-
powered hybrid type 1 trial to test the effectiveness of the intervention, as well as collect implementation data."

CD14 is a coreceptor that facilitates the innate immune responses triggered by a broad range of pathogen-
derived molecules and host damage-derived danger signals. These properties, which contribute to the rapid
mobilization of the immune system, can also contribute to the exacerbation of inflammatory immune
responses, particularly when tissue damage is extensive. Because of this, CD14 is an attractive target for the
modulation of the 'cytokine storms' associated with severe bacterial sepsis, cancer immunotherapies, and the
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that is seen in severe cases of COVID-19. Tumor necrosis factor
(TNFα) is one of the most prominent inflammatory cytokines associated with these storms, and TNFα-blocking
biologicals have proven useful in treating these inflammatory syndromes. However, we currently lack therapies
for the persistent immune paralysis associated with sepsis and ARDS. Here, we build on recent findings from
our collaborators, who have extended the in vitro coreceptor-like functions of CD14 to the death domain-
containing receptors FAS and TNFR1. This is clinically significant, because it suggests that CD14 participates
in the induction of inflammatory cytokines and in the effector responses set in motion by those very cytokines.
Further studies established that CD14 and TRIF are required for the induction of lethal sepsis by TNFα. In
conjunction with in vitro biochemical data, these findings indicate that CD14 modulates the signals initiated by
TNFR1 in precisely the same way that it augments LPS-induced signals: by engaging endosomal signaling
pathways that act via TRAM, TRIF, TBK1, and IRF3 to promote type-I interferon production and inflammatory
cell death. Thus, CD14 may contribute to septic immunoparalysis by inducing the death of immune cells
exposed to FasL or TNFα. For this reason, it is crucial to understand how CD14 interacts with these receptors.
However, these receptors do not share ligands, and CD14, which is a GPI-anchored protein, lacks the
transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions typically associated with signaling effectors. Via an exhaustive
analysis of the evolutionary histories of CD14, TNFα, and TNFR1, we identified features that appear to have
coevolved in placental mammals and that could plausibly link CD14 to TNFα/TNFR1 complexes. In order to
clarify how CD14 contributes to septic phenomena in vivo, this proposal will evaluate the hypothesized link
between CD14 and TNFα/TNFR1 complexes (Aim 1), and will determine whether CD14 promotes sepsis via
cell-intrinsic signaling events occurring in myeloid cells and/or stromal tissues (Aim 2). These efforts are
intended to rapidly narrow the scope of future enquiry by identifying viable mechanisms with the greatest
explanatory power. In so doing, this work will set the stage for examinations of these pathways in vivo."

Overview: The proposal aims to advance the science of geriatric palliative care by assessing the feasibility and
acceptability of implementing radio frequency (RF) sensors to capture cardiopulmonary measures in nursing
home (NH) patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD) and using machine learning to
help predict when a patient may be experiencing an episode of respiratory distress.
Background: In NH patients with advanced ADRD, respiratory distress is common and can occur in up to 80%
of patients. Respiratory distress can lead to negative patient outcomes such as increased suffering, poor quality
of life, and unwanted care transitions. Given that ADRD
approximately
patients make up 48% of all NH residents, with
60% of those having moderate to severe cognitive impairment,it is critical that we find ways to
better identify and detect respiratory distress in this vulnerable patient population.
Research plan: The proposal aims to (1) assess the feasibility and acceptability of implementing RF sensors to
capture cardiopulmonary waveforms in NH patients with advanced ADRD and (2) develop a machine learning
algorithm that will autonomously detect and predict respiratory distress using collected cardiopulmonary
recordings. Furthermore, interviews will be conducted with NH staff and legal authorized representatives of
patients with dementia to gain insight into the potential use and challenges of implementing RF sensors to help
in the detection and prediction of respiratory distress in patients with advanced ADRD.
Environment: The study team is a distinguished group with expertise in geriatrics, palliative medicine,
pulmonary medicine, and biosensor technology/artificial intelligence. By combining the resources at Weill
Cornell Medicine, Cornell University, Archcare, the proposal has the potential to lead to advances in how
respiratory distress is monitored and detected in NH patients with ADRD, with the goal of reducing patient
suffering and burdensome care transitions."

Inborn errors of immunity (IEI; or primary immunodeficiencies) comprise a large, heterogeneous group of
inherited genetic defects that manifest as acute sensitivity to infection or recurring infection, autoimmunity,
autoinflammation, allergies, or malignancy. Even in the case of exceptionally rare IEIs, studies of the impact(s)
of these genetic defects can offer an unparalleled opportunity to gain deeper insight into the molecular and
cellular mechanisms of fundamental immune system function. Through our established connection to a multi-
national clinical monitoring network, we identified an unprecedented IEI arising from a single heterozygous
missense mutation in the gene encoding the innate immune protein and double-stranded (ds)RNA sensor
oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OASL) which results in a glutamic acid to lysin amino acid substitution at a
critical site in the protein structure. This new IEI was identified in a patient with a post-infectious bronchiolitis
obliterans triggered by adenovirus (a double-stranded (ds)DNA-virus). This finding and our preliminary
investigations implicate OASL gain-of-function and dysregulation of currently uncharacterized connections
between innate immune networks sensing dsRNA (via retinoic acid-inducible gene I; RIG-I) and dsDNA (via
cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; cGAS) as the basis of this novel IEI. However, the nature of the protein defect and
how it leads to aberrant, disease-causing OASL activity is currently unknown. In this exploratory research
program, we will test our current working model in which the E237K amino acid substitution changes OASL
structure and/ or dynamics in a manner that shifts the balance of OASL innate immune signaling via altered
interaction with its binding partners (e.g. dsRNA or cGAS) or altered regulation of their activity (e.g. cGAS
activation by dsDNA). The aims of this proposal will address the following two overarching questions: Aim 1–
How does the OASL-E273K substitution alter OASL protein structure and dynamics? Aim 2–What is the effect
of the OASL-E273K substitution on OASL’s interaction with dsRNA and with cGAS, and on cGAS activation by
dsDNA? We will use a powerful combination of approaches to address these questions, including computational,
e.g. classical and accelerated molecular dynamics simulations coupled with protein residue pathway analyses,
and experimental approaches, e.g. hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry, X-ray
crystallographic structure determination, and defined in vitro binding and enzyme activity assays. Collectively,
this exploratory project will establish the necessary foundation for detailed future studies that promise to
significantly deepen our understanding of OASL’s function(s) as a point of innate immune pathway crosstalk in
a cellular context and during infection, as well as the molecular basis of the novel OASL IEI we have identified."

 MDS represents a group of acquired bone marrow failure syndromes arising from hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs). While most MDS patients experience progressive cytopenias, a significant minority (30%) will progress
to acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, the mechanisms that determine whether patients experience
progressive cytopenias or leukemia transformation are poorly understood. While the ineffectiveness of MDS
therapies is due to their inability to effectively eliminate MDS clones and/or restore normal differentiation, it
remains unclear whether hypomethylating agents (HMAs) act on HSCs or committed progenitors to induce
hematologic improvement and/or reductions in blast count, or if HMAs act through similar or unique mechanisms
in these distinct cell populations. We and others have shown that MDS HSCs exhibit markedly different gene
expression profiles than CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and that they are also genetically
and transcriptionally heterogeneous6-10; however, these prior studies were not designed to specifically capture
committed progenitor contributions to disease progression or therapeutic responses to HMAs. We hypothesize
that HSCs and committed progenitors from MDS patients who experience progressive cytopenias or
leukemic transformation exhibit unique transcriptional signatures prior to, and in response to, HMA
therapy. Secondarily, we hypothesize that HMAs induce unique transcriptional and functional changes
in MDS HSCs and committed progenitors, and that their ability to induce specific transcriptional
programs determines whether or not patients respond with hematologic improvements and/or blast
reductions. We propose to elucidate the transcriptional basis of HSC and committed progenitor responses from
MDS patients at the single cell level using novel full-length cDNA scRNA-seq technologies that will allow
simultaneous characterization of the transcriptome and mutational data within individual cells from paired pre-
and post-therapy samples from MDS patients with different types of disease progression and responses to HMA
therapy. We also will evaluate the clinical relevance of our findings by evaluating MDS-associated RNA features
in larger cohorts of MDS patients for whom transcriptome data and clinical outcome data are available.
Assessments of the contribution of dysregulated transcripts to MDS progression will be evaluated using mouse
models of MDS as well as primary MDS patient cells. Overall, we expect our studies to: 1) Identify the genes
and biological pathways that determine whether MDS patients will experience progressive cytopenia versus
leukemic transformation; 2) Elucidate the roles of different HSPC populations in determining clinical responses
to HMA therapy; 3) Identify novel biomarkers for prognostication of clinical outcomes and therapy responses in
MDS; 4) Provide the biological rationale for future clinical studies of novel pathway- or genetically-targeted
agents in combination with HMAs."

Summary of Proposal: This proposal supports a 5-year mentored career development award investigating the
tissue-based immune response through the lens of a recent phase 1 immunotherapeutic vaccine trial with the
long-term goal of contributing to the development of an effective herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) vaccine and
improving global health.. This trial involved three sequential doses of an immunotherapeutic vaccine, HSV529,
in individuals with symptomatic HSV-2 infection. T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire analysis was performed of T
cells in small biopsies of the area of HSV-2 reactivation in comparison to T cells from biopsies of uninvolved skin
and HSV-2 reactive CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood to research two main lines of inquiry. The first is the
interrelatedness, over time, of the TCR repertoire of the genital skin at HSV-2 reactivation sites, the arm, and
HSV-2 specific CD4+ T cells over time; whether T cells detected in genital tissue are detectable in blood with
standard sampling techniques. The second is how these relationships and dynamics change over the course of
an immunotherapeutic vaccination. Preliminary findings suggest that some T cells increased in number after
vaccination in everyone, with very little overlap between the skin and the blood. The central hypothesis is that
T cells that respond to a vaccine targeting HSV-2 are likely to be HSV-2-specific, and that T cells seen in tissue
at high copy number over a long period of time are likely to be tissue residents. The objective of this proposal
is to learn more about these resident T cells, which are otherwise difficult to study. The rationale for this is that
vaccine development for HSV-2 has thus far not been successful, and that because there is so little overlap
between the skin and the blood, that looking directly at the tissue may help identify a viral antigen or a way to
target skin-based T cells to improve vaccine efficacy. Research plan: AIM 1a will identify the specificity of T
cells of that were seen most frequently in the region of HSV-2 reactivation, focusing on T cells that expanded in
number after immunotherapeutic vaccination, as these are the most likely to be herpes-specific, tissue-resident
cells. AIM 1b focuses on establishing the spatial location of these cells in small sections of biopsies using
fluorescent molecular tags to visualize their arrangement in skin. AIM 2 focuses on learning more about these T
cells by using transcriptional profiling, a technique that separates each of the T cells in a biopsy and looks at
them one by one to uncover the cellular processes that define the activity of each cell. We will incorporate
information from TCR repertoire analysis to interpret the results of transcriptional profiling more effectively and
accurately. This approach uses small skin samples in the most comprehensive manner available to describe the
fight between HSV-2 and the human immune system. By conducting this research with an extremely experienced
and uniquely skilled group of mentors in the rich educational environment of the FHCRC and UW, Dr. Ford will
become an effective and productive lead investigator."

Circadian rhythms are nearly ubiquitous endogenous timing systems that help coordinate the myriad
physiological, metabolic and developmental processes that occur continuously in each organism at all times of
the day. This circadian clock is comprised at the molecular level of interlocked and autoregulatory feedback
loops that are built from complex interactions that are constantly changing in relation to each throughout the 24
hour cycle. The long term goal of this project is to understand the functional relationships among the inter- and
intracellular processes that keep the circadian oscillator running and coordinated across the plant. We are
using genetic, genomic, biochemical and cell biological tools and strategies of the model plant Arabidopsis to
identify the molecules and mechanisms that regulate the transport of clock proteins between the cytosol and
nucleus. We are focused in part on how post-translational modifications of clock proteins affect both their
positional and temporal intracellular localization. Gatekeeping features of the intracellular environment, such as
the nuclear pore (NP), are also addressed, using select NP mutants, and at the level of a single molecular
species. We are applying for the first time in circadian studies single cell imaging techniques using a
photoswitchable fluorescent protein to assess features of clock protein movement and turnover that will be
applicable to non-plant circadian systems. Long-distance circadian signaling from shoot to root will be explored
using select photoreceptor, kinase and glucose-signaling mutants as well as aberrant meristem mutants.
Unbiased mutant screens to identify proteolytic factors controlling clock protein levels will help understand the
importance of precise time-of-day phasing of these factors. We are also exploiting certain plant-specific
advantages of small RNA processing to address other post-transcriptional control mechanisms of the circadian
clock. Taken together our program will probe mechanisms of circadian control that should be broadly
applicable across all eukaryotic systems."
10811933,"ABSTRACT
 For more than 100 years much of oculomotor research in primates has been guided by Hering's law, which
states that any eye movement generated by the brain will be sent equally to the two eyes so that they move as
a yoked pair. Refixations between targets in different directions involve saccades, which are conjugate
movements that have peak velocities of hundreds of degrees per second. Refixations between targets at different
distances require vergence eye movements, which slowly rotate the eyes by equal amounts in opposite
directions. For gaze shifts between targets that differ in both direction and distance, vergence velocity is
substantially higher during the saccade. The neural basis for this effect has been the subject of intense debate
for more than 35 years. According to one view, consistent with Hering's Law, the extremely high intrasaccaddic
vergence velocity results from a non-linear interaction between saccades and vergence. Alternatively, the
vergence angle changes rapidly during the saccade because the saccadic system programs unequal saccades.
This latter view would be inconsistent with Hering's law, since it necessitates the generation of unequal saccadic
commands. For this reason, virtually all of the relevant neurophysiological studies have targeted brain areas
involved in the generation of saccadic eye movements. The existing literature has yielded conflicting results,
which is why this problem remains controversial. The experiments in this proposal take a novel approach,
primarily by targeting brain areas involved in the generation of vergence eye movements during both slow
vergence and disjunctive saccades."
10812299,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Senescence, like apoptosis, is an established tumor suppressive mechanism that protects against cancer
development by inducing sustained proliferative arrest. Apoptosis and senescence are common fates of cancer
therapy and both contribute to clinical response. When cancer cells receive a lethal dose of a cancer
therapeutic, they typically execute apoptosis. Conversely, cellular damage that results from sub-lethal doses
induces a senescent fate. Although therapies that trigger stable senescence (pro-senescent) are beneficial
because they suppress proliferation, senescent cancer cells can resume proliferation, often with more
biologically aggressive features, therefore the durability of senescence is an important pharmacologic property.
We have designed and synthesized congeners of the taxane-site tubulin molecule (+)-discodermolide (DDM),
that potently induce cell death AND senescence in taxane-refractory triple negative breast cancer models.
Pleasingly, the senescent phenotype induced by these analogs is significantly more durable than the parent
molecule, Taxol or other cytotoxic drugs, thereby improving the potential for prolonged anti-tumor efficacy.
Using X-ray crystallography, we will continue to evolve the chemistry of DDM to better engage underexplored
residues of the taxane pharmacophore to address whether differential occupation of DDM congeners impacts
pharmacology, cell fate and metabolic stability. We will also generate fluorescent DDM molecules to track the
distribution and longevity of DDM-stabilized microtubules using time-lapse imaging. Multiplexed, dose-
response modeling in taxane-refractory cancer cell lines will primarily guide the selection of lead DDM
molecules for in vivo analyses.
In Aim 2, we will use X-ray crystallography and Cryo-EM to decipher DDM-tubulin and DDM-microtubule
interactions, of lead DDM congeners. These results will feed back to Aim 1 to guide more efficient chemical
optimization and potentially provide mechanistic insight for the durable senescence of DDM molecules.
In Aim 3 we will evaluate the optimal dosing and in vivo safety of lead DDM molecules in C57BL/6 mice,
focusing on hematologic, neuropathic and behavioral metrics, as well as histopathologic analyses. Anti-tumor
efficacy in models of Taxol-resistance using patient-derived breast cancer xenografts will also be evaluated.
This interdisciplinary, collaborative program will employ chemical synthesis, structural biology and phenotypic
screening tactics to develop highly efficacious and metabolically stable DDM analogs that mobilize both
apoptosis and senescence cell fates to maximize tumor suppressive capabilities."
10813697,"Abstract
 Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed in over 20% breast cancers, and
to a lesser degree in gastric cancers, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancers and bladder cancers. In HER2+
tumors, HER2s are massively overexpressed and constitutively dimerized, leading to unrelenting
activation of down-stream proliferation and survival pathways and malignant phenotype. Because of the
high expression level of HER2, trastuzumab and pertuzumab, the two anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies
are ineffective as monotherapy against these tumors. They need to be given in combinations with other
HER2-targeted therapy, chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. Here we will optimize and further improve
a novel HER2-mediated, peptide-based, and non-toxic transformable nano-agent that has been proven
to be highly efficacious as a monotherapy against HER2+ breast cancer xenograft models. This receptor-
mediated transformable nanotherapy is comprised of a peptide with unique domains that allow self-
assembly forming micelles under aqueous conditions and transformation into nanofibrils at the tumor site,
where HER2 is encountered. The resulting nanofibrillar network effectively suppresses HER2
dimerization, and downstream signaling leading to increased tumor cell death and complete remission of
the HER2+ tumors in xenograft models.
 We recently reported the development of an ICG-derivatized nanoplatform that can deliver potent
immuno-stimulant imiquimod to the tumor sites in a 4T1 syngeneic breast cancer model, and we were
able to demonstrate that upon local light illumination (800nm) of the tumor, the photo-active micellar
nanoplatform was able to elicit a strong systemic anti-tumor immune response, particularly when given
in conjunction with anti-PD1 antibody. In addition to potent abscopal effects, this nano-photo-immuno-
therapeutic regimen was able to elicit strong immuno-memory against future tumor implants.
 For this R01-IRCN proposal, we will apply some of the promising features of the two above mentioned
nanoplatforms, to generate a novel HER2-targeting transformable cancer targeting nanoplatform (TCTN)
that not only can directly suppress HER2 dimerization and signaling leading to tumor cell death, but can
also greatly augment systemic anti-tumor immune response. To achieve this, we will modularly
incorporate to the transformable nanoplatform HER2 binding ligands, T-cell and macrophage capturing
agents (e.g. LLP2A targets activated α4β1 integrin of immune cells), galectin-1 inhibitor (e.g. LLS30) and
immunostimulant (e.g. resiquimod).
Specific Aims:
Aim 1. To design, synthesize, & characterize the novel transformable HER2-targeting TCTN
nanoplatform.
Aim 2. To use optical and MR imaging methods to determine the biodistribution of the TCTN constructs
in xenograft, PDX and syngeneic tumor models. To use the novel in-house developed EyePod intravital
imaging system to longitudinally evaluate, in real time, the intra-tumoral distribution and in situ
transformation of TCTN, cellular immune response, and tumor response of sub-retinal tumor implant.
Aim 3. To evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of TCTN in HER2+ PDX models of breast and gastric cancers.
Aim 4. To evaluate the immunotherapeutic efficacy of TCTN in an immunocompetent murine syngeneic
breast cancer model comprised of HuHER2-L2-Luc+ murine breast cancer cell lines implanted
orthotopically in MMTV.f.HuHER2 transgenic mice."
10813698,"Human cerebral malaria (HCM) is a severe form of Plasmodium falciparum (P.f.) malaria associated with
~500,000 deaths in children annually and impaired brain function in some survivors. HCM is characterized by
sequestration of parasitized red blood cells (pRBCs) in cerebral micro-circulation and induction of inflammatory
mediators, brain swelling and impaired consciousness with unarousable coma. We have determined that
circulating free heme and parasite histidine rich protein 2 (HRP2), by-products of pRBC lysis, are major causes
of brain inflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, and brain injury associated with HCM. However,
defining the mechanism(s) mediating these effects in HCM is challenging in the absence of suitable models. In
vitro 2D cell culture, 3D brain organoid and animal models (ECM; Plasmodium berghei ANKA in C57BL/6) all
indicate that heme and HRP2 induced cellular apoptosis, inflammation, and tissue disorganization. In ECM,
heme causes brain vascular endothelial cell apoptosis, alters Angiopoietins 1 and 2 ratios, upregulates CXCL10,
Heme Oxygenase 1, and tau as well as compromise BBB integrity through STAT3 signaling via matrix
metalloproteinase three (MMP3). Following a screen for therapeutic agents against ECM, we identified
Neuregulin- 1(NRG1), an 8 kDa neuropeptide currently undergoing clinical trials against heart failure, that
attenuates ECM when delivered intravenously at 5µg/kg. NRG1 mediates phosphorylation of ErbB4 (receptor),
activates AKT and inactivates STAT3 in human brain microvascular endothelial cells. ECM resistant mice
(BALB/c) constitutively expressed higher levels of NRG1 in brain tissue than ECM susceptible (C57BL/6) mice.
Since circulating NRG1 is severely depleted in both fatal HCM and ECM, levels of NRG1 need to be assessed
prospectively to ascertain amounts needed for augmentation to mitigate HCM severity. Interestingly, CD8+Tcell
PD1/PD-L1 signaling mediated ECM recovery and PD1 was upregulated by NRG1. Using a human stem cell-
derived neurovascular unit (NVU; brain chip), ECM and human subjects, we will determine the mechanism by
which NRG1 attenuates cerebral malaria. We hypothesize that therapeutic administration of NRG1 will attenuate
heme and HRP2-induced NVU damage and ECM mortality via NRG1/ErbB4 and PD/PD-L1 signaling. Our
objective is to functionally assess the key regulatory pathways mediated by NRG1 to attenuate ECM, and heme-
and HRP2-induced NVU damage. The specific aims are: 1) to test the hypothesis that an algorithm, consisting
of NRG1, heme, HRP2, and markers of neuronal injury and inflammation can predict HCM severity, mortality
and neurobehavioral sequelae; 2) to test the hypothesis that NRG1/ErbB4 and PD1/PD-L1 signaling crosstalk
protects against heme and HRP2-induced damage in human NVU; and 3) to test the hypothesis that NRG1
attenuates ECM brain injury and behavioral deficit via NRG1/ErbB4 and PD1/PD-L1 signaling. Understanding
the role of NRG1 in cerebral malaria pathogenesis and sequelae in survivors will enable us to determine the
feasibility of targeting NRG1 in clinical trials with the ultimate goal of improving the survival of children with HCM."
10813849,"Cognitive impairment in chronic well-controlled HIV infection continues to affect from 30%-60%
of individuals. Mechanisms are still unknown but probably associated with continued
neuroinflammation. Biomarkers for cognitive impairment have been inconsistent although
neuroimaging has emerged as a possibility. Unfortunately, imaging is expensive with limited
access. Exosomes are small microvesicles shed from most all cells under normal and pathologic
conditions. The cellular cargo packaged into exosomes can represent the state of the parent cell.
We have isolated neuron-derived exosomes (NDE) in plasma using a 2-step isolation procedure
and a cell surface neuron specific antibody. We have shown in a recently completed R21 using
mass spectroscopy that NDE are rich in over 50 neuronal proteins. In addition, using proximity
extension analysis (PEA) for neurology biomarkers, we identified an additional 28 proteins that
were present. At least 7 proteins were statistically significantly differentially expressed in HIV
infection alone, neurocognitive impairment in HIV+ women versus men and 1 protein that was
significantly correlated with age and impairment. Several NDE proteins correlate with cognitive
domains and several differentiate HIV cognitive impairment from Alzheimer’s disease. Our
overall hypothesis is that NDE can be used to diagnose cognitive impairment in HIV infection
and that men and women have different proteins in NDE that will influence diagnosis and
treatment. We further plan to differentiate mild cognitive impairment with that associated with a
pre-Alzheimer’s mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis. To test this hypothesis, we propose
the following Specific Aims: (1) Select and verify a set of neuronal exosome proteins that predict
and diagnose HIV cognitive impairment with aging in women and men, (2) Determine whether
neuronal exosome cargo can differentiate HIV-associated cognitive impairment from mild
MCI/Alzheimer’s disease (3) Correlate HIV NDE protein targets and cognitive domains
associated with neuroimaging markers of injury and (4) Establish a rapid ultrasensitive assay
using verified neuronal exosome target proteins for diagnosis of HIV cognitive impairment in a
longitudinal cohort. We will utilize a multidisciplinary approach that includes basic research of
protein targets correlated with cognitive domains and clinical diagnosis using neuroimaging
correlation with selected biomarker proteins. These results will have major impact on treatment
and cure of HIV in the brain as fluid biomarkers are discovered and the health of the neuron can
be assessed in “real time.”"
10812565,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Type II diabetes (TIID) is the most prevalent form of diabetes and doubles a patient’s risk for cardiovascular
disease (CVD) heart failure, independent of additional risk factors. In fact, CVD that occurs in patients with TIID is
termed, ‘diabetic cardiomyopathy’ (DC). While impaired cardiac insulin signaling, or insulin resistance, is a major
factor in DC pathogenesis, current therapies focus on reducing blood glucose versus restoring insulin sensitivity.
Our overall objective to identify the major mediators of cardiac insulin sensitivity and resistance in an effort to
identify novel therapeutic targets for DC. Using unbiased genome-wide approaches, we uncovered ‘regulated in
development and DNA damage 1’ (Redd1, also known as Ddit4) as the most transcriptionally active, insulin-
inducible gene in the murine heart. This correlated with insulin-inducible increases in REDD1 gene and protein
expression. REDD1 is an established inhibitor of mTORC1 signaling, however, the mechanisms by which this
occurs remain unclear. In addition, REDD1 has been implicated in both insulin sensitivity and resistance, but with
no consensus. Our preliminary data demonstrate that, in addition to insulin, fatty acids and high fat diet (HFD)
selectively induce REDD1 expression. We also show that insulin increases, while HFD prevents, REDD1 nuclear
localization in the heart. Our data also outline a novel potential mechanism whereby insulin increases REDD1
expression, nuclear localization, and chromatin binding, enhancing the transcription of REDD1-bound oxidative
metabolic genes and inhibiting the transcription of REDD1-bound autophagic and mitophagic genes in the heart. It
is our central hypothesis that high fat drives insulin resistance by preventing insulin-mediated REDD1 nuclear
localization, which results in suppressed oxidative metabolism and activated autophagy and mitophagy, mainly via
loss of nuclear REDD1-dependent transcriptional regulation, as well as enhanced mTORC1 inhibition. We will test
this hypothesis with three specific aims. We will (1) determine the cytosolic role of REDD1 in mediating cardiac
insulin resistance, (2) investigate the mechanism of REDD1 nuclear localization and its role in mediating cardiac
insulin sensitivity, and (3) examine the effects of REDD1 on insulin-dependent cardiac transcription and gene
expression. Here, we will use a novel mouse model with cardiomyocyte REDD1 deletion, as well as isolate these
cardiomyocytes for in vitro studies. These mice or cardiomyocytes will be subjected to high fat to induce insulin
resistance, using well established models. We will also employ four novel REDD1 mutants to examine the
contributions of REDD1-dependent mTORC1 inhibition, nuclear localization, and chromatin binding to cardiac
insulin sensitivity versus resistance. Overall, we expect that high fat will prevent insulin-inducible nuclear
localization, chromatin binding, and activation of oxidative metabolic and suppression of autophagic and mitophagic
genes. Accordingly, we predict that this is a major mechanism by which high fat drives insulin resistance. These
studies are critical as we predict that restoring nuclear REDD1 will restore insulin sensitivity and prevent cardiac
dysfunction. Investigation of these critical pathways is essential for the developing novel therapies for TIID and DC."
10812698,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreatic
islets. Several theories have been proposed to explain T1D pathogenesis including aberrant immune cell activity
as well as increased β-cell sensitivity to inflammatory and metabolic stressors. It has become increasingly
apparent that β-cells may not be passive immune cell targets but can contribute to the disease intrinsically.
However, it remains unclear whether the risk of developing T1D is already introduced during β-cell formation.
Postnatal β-cell maturation may be a T1D relevant β-cell developmental process, not only because it occurs
during the peak incidence of T1D diagnosis but also because it determines whether an individual has an
adequate functional β-cell pool to cope with environmental stressors. However, the mechanisms underlying
human β-cell maturation have been understudied due to the absence of an appropriate human β-cell model.
While human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived β-cells (SC-β-cells) hold immense potential for modeling T1D,
current production methods do not permit proper functional maturation, hampering their utility in studying β-cell
maturation. One of the hallmark features of mature β-cells is glucose-induced mitochondrial respiration, which is
lacking in SC-β-cells. It has been suggested that environmental cues, such as nutrients and circadian rhythm,
drive β-cell maturation and establish a mature β-cell state through gene expression regulation and epigenetic
modifications. Our objective is to uncover gene regulatory mechanisms that underlie the acquisition of glucose-
dependent mitochondrial function in human β-cells and assess the suitability of SC-β-cells as a model for
studying β-cell maturation. This work will leverage the genomic and genetic methodologies that we have
previously developed for SC-β-cells, including a platform for genome-wide functional perturbation screening,
single-cell genomics assays, and a computational tool to infer gene regulatory networks. Expanding on our
preliminary studies, we propose to investigate and modify key transcriptional programs governing SC-β-cell
mitochondrial activity and induce maturation in vitro (Aim 1). Mechanistically, we plan to investigate the
correlation between changes in SC-β-cell function and the epigenome that occurs during the maturation process
(Aim 2). It has been established that SC-β-cells exhibit improved function following engraftment into mice. Thus,
in the second aim of our study, we will also investigate epigenetic alterations that occur during this in vivo
maturation process. We anticipate that our in vitro manipulation of key transcriptional programs will induce similar
epigenetic remodeling as observed in vivo. Together, our proposed study will advance the culture of SC-β-cells
and demonstrate their utility as a model for investigating human β-cell maturation."

Project Summary
 The goal of this project is to establish a Summer Institute in Biostatistics and Undergraduate Data Sci-
ence at the University of California, Irvine. The investigators will develop short courses in modern method-
ology and practice of biostatistics and data science. These courses will highlight applications in cutting
edge biomedical research, will train students in fundamentals of biostatistics, data science, and com-
puting, and will culminate in a team project co-supervised by statisticians and biomedical scientists. In
addition, the institute will include sessions helping students improve their transferrable skills: e.g., oral
and written presentation skills. Particular attention will be paid to mentoring and career guidance. The
institute will culminate with a mini-symposium with keynote lectures and a student poster session. One
of the main goals of the proposed institute will be attracting mathematically inclined undergraduate
students, especially from groups that are underrepresented in STEM ﬁelds, to the ﬁeld of Biostatistics
and Biomedical Data Science.
 UC Irvine is ideally suited for hosting the proposed institute. The institute leadership team consists
of UC Irvine Statistics faculty. The Department of Statistics at UC Irvine is heavily invested in biomedical
research directly relevant to the mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and National Insti-
tute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which guarantees that there will be no shortage of highly qualiﬁed
summer institute instructors. Design and analysis of clinical trials, causal inference, modeling of infectious
disease dynamics, analysis of big data in genomics, transcriptomics, and image analysis provide a small
sample of potential applications that will be used as examples in the institute short courses. Another ad-
vantage of Statistics faculty being at the helm of the summer institute is vast experience of the leadership
team and the rest of the department faculty in teaching and mentoring undergraduate students. The School
of Information and Computer Science, which houses Computer Science, Informatics, and Statistics Depart-
ments, is a national leader in Data Science education and research — the school is home to one of the ﬁrst
in the nation Data Science undergraduate degree programs and Data Science Institute that serves as a hub
of data-driven research at UC Irvine. UC Irvine successful recruitment of underrepresented populations
has been recognized by Hispanic-serving institution and Asian American and Native American Paciﬁc Is-
lander Serving Institution designations. The summer institute recruitment of participants will tap into UC
Irvine existing programs and infrastructure for reaching out to underrepresented student groups. The con-
ﬂuence of Biostatistics and Biomedical Data Science expertise, investment in Data Science research and
pedagogical innovations, and strong commitment to diversity and inclusion ensures that Irvine Summer

10812789,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Misregulation of nucleoporins (NUPs), the essential constituents of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), and
dysfunction of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) signaling have been individually linked to cancer. Although it has been
reported that NPC-mediated macromolecular transport cooperates with m6A modification to control movement
of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) out of the nucleus, contribution of such cooperation to pathogenesis and
progression of cancer remains obscure.
 Our proteomic study of NPC-associated cofactors revealed a direct interaction between the m6A
methyltransferase METTL3 and one of the NUP proteins called NUP93 in several cancer cell lines including
prostate cancer (PCa). Although each protein has been indicated to involve in the progression of some types of
human malignancies, their functions and molecular mechanisms of action are poorly understood in PCa, let
alone their interaction. Our immunohistochemistry analysis showed that both METTL3 and NUP93 proteins are
upregulated in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), a lethal form of the disease, compared
to primary tumors and their normal counterparts. Disrupting the METTL-NUP93 complex by genetic mutations
of residues mediating this interaction abrogated proliferation and migration of CRPC cells. These results suggest
that the METTL3-NUP93 complex may play an important role in PCa progression to castration resistance and
the underlying mechanism is worthy of further investigation.
 Considering that both NPCs and m6A machinery control the nucleocytoplasmic transport of mRNAs, we
performed fractionation RNA-seq to identify mRNA molecules whose nuclear abundance is changed upon
knockdown of METTL3 and NUP93 in PCa cells. A large group of mRNAs were significantly retained in the nuclei
of both knockdown cells, suggesting that METTL3 and NUP93 coregulate the nuclear export of these mRNAs.
The mRNA cargos of the METTL3-NUP93 complex are preferentially methylated, allowing them to be selected
by the complex via association with METTL3. Interestingly, a subset of these mRNA cargos is functionally
involved in the biosynthesis of the sex hormone androgen that is well known to activate the main driver of PCa
progression, androgen receptor (AR). Indeed, overexpression of the wild-type METTL3 and NUP93, but not the
mutant forms interrupting the new mRNA transport pathway, increases intracellular androgen levels in PCa cells,
upregulates the expression of AR target genes even without addition of the ligand and confers the androgen-
independent growth of PCa cells, implying the development of hormone-refractory phenotypes. All these effects
can be alleviated by the pharmacological inhibitors of the steroidogenic enzymes encoded by the target mRNAs
of the METTL3-NUP93 complex. So, our hypothesis is: Upregulation of METTL3 and NUP93 promotes PCa
progression by facilitating the nuclear export of mRNAs, a subgroup of which encode androgen
biosynthesis enzymes that trigger the activation of AR signaling in CRPC.
 In this proposal, we will address three mechanistically and clinically important questions in the fields of RNA
methylation and cancer biology: (1). How the METTL3-NUP93 complex selects target mRNAs and expediates
their nuclear export; (2). How the mRNA export mediated by the METTL3-NUP93 complex orchestrates AR
activity under castration condition; (3). How we can genetically and pharmacologically block the new mRNA
transport pathway to treat CRPC. We will leverage our experience in genome/transcriptome-wide profiling and
m6A-editing tools, as well as that of our collaborators in high-resolution microscopy and establishment of
preclinical models, to elucidate the function of crosstalk between NPCs and m6A machinery in cancer and to
explore the mechanisms underlying the development of CRPC using cellular and animal models."
10814206,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the most common cardiovascular condition in preterm infants, is associated with
mortality and harmful longer-term outcomes including chronic lung disease (CLD) and brain injury. Although
treatment does not benefit all infants with PDA, likely due to spontaneous closure, treatment of some infants with
symptomatic PDA is necessary. Medications are often used to close persistent preterm PDA in the initial four
weeks postnatal, but fail to close the PDA in 1/3 of infants, in whom an intervention is the only remaining definitive
closure option (failed pharmacological management). A treatment dilemma exists in the first postnatal month for
the subset of infants with persistent, hemodynamically significant, and clinically symptomatic PDA (HSPDA) after
postnatal week one following failed pharmacological management. Invasive, intrathoracic PDA surgery was tra-
ditionally employed for infants with HSPDA, but associations between surgery and adverse neurodevelopment
prompted widespread adoption of non-interventional, supportive treatment. This watchful-waiting approach
avoids or delays procedure-related complications, but prolongs developing brain and lung exposure to PDA-
related hemodynamics. Evidence is emerging that duration of HSPDA exposure is an important predictor of CLD
and/or death. Percutaneous catheter-based closure (PPC) is a novel, minimally-invasive means of closing a
HSPDA. A duct occluder (ADO-II AS) was recently approved (1/2019) by the US FDA for preterm infants weigh-
ing ≥700 grams. However, the effectiveness of PPC in improving important neonatal outcomes relative to sup-
portive (non-intervention) HSPDA management has never been evaluated via a randomized trial (RCT). The
uncertainty is whether PPC should be performed early (days 7-30 postnatal) for all infants with HSDPA to prevent
PDA-related complications or only rarely as a last resort following a prolonged trial of supportive management.
The objective in this application is to determine if PPC improves cardiopulmonary and neurodevelopmental out-
comes via a multicenter RCT comparing the two strategies. Aim 1 will determine the effect of PPC versus sup-
portive treatment on ventilator-free days (VFDs) at 30 days post-randomization (non-survivors will be scored as
having zero VFDs). Aim 2 will determine the effect of PPC versus supportive treatment on secondary cardiopul-
monary, safety and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 4 months corrected age (CA). Aim 3 will evaluate whether
neurodevelopment at 3-4 months CA is mediated by improved neurodevelopmental profiles at 34-36 weeks
PMA. Aim 4 will evaluate potential effect modifiers of HDPSA (e.g., sex, race/ethnicity, gestational age, age at
randomization) on VFDs and secondary outcomes. This trial will immediately advance the care of extremely
preterm infants with HSPDA following failed medical management by identifying whether PPC or supportive
treatment better improves cardiopulmonary and neurodevelopmental outcomes."

Ashley A. Leech, PhD, MS is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Health Policy at the Vanderbilt
University School of Medicine. As a health decision scientist and health services researcher, Dr. Leech seeks
to identify and improve the delivery of high-value health services to address the specialized needs of
reproductive age and pregnant women in the US. This training grant will support her career goal of becoming a
leading investigator who specializes in decision science methodology to empirically inform decision making on
health services and resource priorities for marginalized women and their children in the US. Specifically, by
evaluating real-world tradeoffs associated with treatment strategies and assessing the value of conducting
further research to reduce decision uncertainty and optimize treatment benefits, she aims to provide a strong
evidence base to improve the care for pregnant women afflicted by addiction.
Opioid use disorder in pregnancy has more than quadrupled in the last two decades, resulting in adverse
pregnancy and birth outcomes and a subsequent rise in healthcare utilization. Furthermore, access to
treatment for pregnant women remains limited and varies geographically and across treatment strategies and
care settings. High-value care for opioid use disorder in pregnancy requires methodologically rigorous studies
that measure both the value of existing and new interventions and analyze the effects of resource constraints
on decision making. To address these gaps, Aim 1 of the proposed research assesses the value of all
available treatment options for pregnant women with opioid use disorder and quantifies the value of obtaining
more research to guide future treatment and management decisions for these patients. Aim 2 takes this
analysis a step further by incorporating resource constraints into the model to optimize care processes and
delivery amid an environment with multiple barriers to timely and appropriate access to treatment. Results from
these aims will collectively inform clinical practice, resource prioritization, and important policy decisions that
can improve the availability of services for this population.
During the award period, Dr. Leech will gain additional methodological expertise in advanced calibration, value
of information analysis, and optimization methods for decision making, while also becoming well-informed in
the clinical and policy space to improve the management and care for pregnant women and children affected
by opioid use. Her mentoring and advisory team are nationally recognized clinicians, methodologists, and
health policy experts who will provide the critical mentorship necessary to advance her career in the fields of
addiction, decision science, and maternal and child health. This award will enable Dr. Leech to become a
leading and independently funded research investigator."
10816887,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cerebral palsy is the most common pediatric movement disorder and is caused by
damage to brain areas during development. Children with unilateral cerebral palsy (UCP), the most
common form of cerebral palsy, have unilateral impairments that cause muscle weakness, poor
coordination, and difficulty grasping objects. These upper-extremity (UE) impairments reduce children's ability
to participate in age-appropriate activities. There is an urgent need for effective hand therapies based on
mechanisms of motor recovery. Growing evidence indicates that skill-based training affords the opportunity to
capitalize on residual brain plasticity in children with UCP and improve hand function. Yet, the diversity of brain
injuries, and subsequent brain reorganization in children with UCP, leads to heterogeneous outcomes even for
the most established therapies. Our long-term goal is to optimize the effectiveness of therapies by adapting
them to the individual characteristics of children with UCP. A critical precursor to this goal is characterizing how
motor pathways adapt following perinatal brain injury. However, how best to examine brain networks
underlying control of the affected UE remains unknown. The objective of this project to use a multimodal
approach to identify atypical functional and anatomical patterns of connectivity in children with UCP and relate
these patterns to impairment in unimanual and bimanual function. Characterizing mechanisms of motor
pathway reorganization will serve as a critical precursor to the development of individualized rehabilitation
approaches. We propose to use measurements of functional cortical activity (i.e. functional near-infrared
spectroscopy) and transcranial magnetic stimulation to determine the unique brain areas responsible for
control of the affected upper-extremity in children with UCP. We will examine these patterns in relation to

10784946,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Cell-cell interactions (CCI) play crucial roles in nearly all important biological processes, including cell
differentiation, inflammation, wound repair and oncogenesis. CCI typically occurs when a sender cell's ligand
interacts with a receiver cell's receptor, leading to changes in the target cell's transcription factor (TF) activities.
Despite the advances in high-throughput methods, there is still a gap in the identification of CCIs from these
data, relying largely on low-throughput manual methods.
 To address this gap, the proposed research aims to develop computational frameworks to model
the impact of external signals on a cell's internal TF activity using a combination of single-cell
multiome (scMultiome) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data. The PI plans to create a series of
computational methods based on his prior work, including: 1) DeepPrism, an improved version of BayesPrism,
to more accurately deconvolve cell type fraction and cell type-specific gene expression from bulk RNA-seq and
ST. 2) SpaceNiche, a method for jointly modeling the relationship between CCI and downstream gene
expression using ST and provide interpretable biological insights about CCI. 3) RegulatoryVAE, a tool to infer
TF activity and the relationship between regulatory elements and target genes from scMultiome which contains
both the chromatin accessibility (ATAC) and gene transcription information. 4) NicheOT, a method to integrate
TF activity learned from scMultiome and the spatial context learned from ST. 5) CARCell, a tool to quantify the
impact of CCI on TF activity and their changes in diseased states.
 These tools will be able to address the significant limitations in existing methods including 1) inability to
account for heterogenous gene expression and to use multiple scRNA-seq reference to perform statistical
deconvolution, 2) the reliance on the transcription level of receptor/ligand to impute CCI, which may not reflect
active protein levels and may fail to account for ineffective interactions due to physical separation or epigenetic
states, and 3) the reliance on incomplete motif information to infer TF activity and the existing model’s
inefficiency in capturing the complex relationship between DNA sequence and TF activity.
 The proposed methods will be applied to study the impact of CCI on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
using scRNA-seq, scMultiome, and Visium data collected by a collaborator. IBD affects nearly 1.3% of adults in
the US and its prevalence is increasing globally. Mis-regulated CCI is a key feature of the disease. By
providing a generalizable tool for understanding CCI using ST and scMultiome, this work aims to fill the current
gap in computational methodologies and advance the understanding of IBD, with the goal of developing new
therapeutic targets."

experience mentoring fellows and junior faculty, including from underrepresented groups. Her leadership role
as MPI in The Physiology of The Weight Reduced State (POWERS) study (5UH3DK128302-03: MPIs Gallagher,

and methodologies. It is well known that obesity is a major contributor to human illness and health care costs.
Modest weight loss can mitigate the severity – or entirely reverse - many of these phenotypes. Maintenance of
a 7% reduced body in persons, lean and with obesity invokes homeostatic changes in energy expenditure
(decreased) and hunger (increased) that tend to restore body weight. We hypothesize that the heterogeneity of

maintenance. POWERS will prospectively interrogate the physiological/behavioral systems that contribute to
variability in weight change following weight loss. Healthy adults with obesity will be studied before and
immediately after weight loss (Phase 1), and during the follow-up 12 months observational Phase 2. Participants
will be extensively phenotyped at 4 timepoints across the 18 months study: weight, body composition, total

10932366,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Every five minutes, a new patient is diagnosed with urothelial carcinoma (UC) in the United States, resulting in
the death of 18,000 patients annually. Nearly all patients with advanced UC will develop resistance to systemic
treatment. Intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) is a major contributor to treatment resistance by increasing the
chance for resistant subclones to emerge. However, genetic ITH is currently not druggable and not considered
in therapeutic decision-making, thus worsening drug-resistant patient phenotypes. The fundamental knowledge
gap regarding genetic drivers of ITH impedes the development of effective therapeutic strategies to prevent and
eliminate drug resistance. Our long-term goal is to define targetable mechanisms of ITH and treatment resistance
to develop an effective precision strategy to achieve cures in patients with advanced UC. The overall objective
is to define targetable mechanisms by which APOBEC3A-mediated ITH drives drug resistance and identify
strategies to eliminate UC cells with APOBEC3A activity. Our central hypothesis is that APOBEC3A-induced
cytidine deamination drives genetic ITH leading to the emergence of therapy-resistant UC clones and, in
so doing, simultaneously creating unique targetable vulnerabilities. This hypothesis was formulated based
on our published work and strong preliminary data showing that APOBEC3A expression in isogenic UC cell lines
and patient-derived organoids drives genetic ITH. We found that APOBEC3A-induced, de novo mutations in the
PIKC3A-AKT-MTOR signaling hub drive the resistance to erdafitinib, an FGFR3-inhibitor (FGFR3i) approved for
UC treatment. Our preliminary data also revealed that APOBEC3A-induced double-stranded DNA breaks are
preferentially repaired by the microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) pathway and that targeting the
critical MMEJ mediator, polymerase theta (Polθ), is synthetically lethal in APOBEC3A-expressing clones. The
rationale is that identifying targetable mechanisms by which APOBEC3A-induced ITH drives drug resistance and
developing strategies to eliminate APOBEC3A-expressing UC cells will improve cure rates for patients. We will
test our hypothesis by pursuing two specific Aims. Aim 1: Identify targetable mechanisms by which APOBEC3A-
induced mutational ITH drives treatment resistance in UC. Aim 2: Identify synthetic lethal strategies to target UC
tumors with APOBEC3A-induced DNA double-strand breaks. Aim 1 will use longitudinal clonal barcoding and in
vitro and in vivo laboratory evolution to identify targetable APOBEC3A-driven kinase hubs that mediate FGFR3i
resistance and validate them in patient samples from FGFR3i clinical trials. Aim 2 will use genetic and
pharmacologic inhibition of Polθ in APOBEC3A-expressing UC models and a co-clinical trial of patient-derived
UC organoids and xenografts to identify clinical biomarkers of response to APOBEC3A-MMEJ synthetic lethality.
The approach is conceptually and technically innovative, creating a new paradigm for eliminating treatment-
resistant cancers. Impact: Completion of the proposed research will establish APOBEC3A as a genetic driver of
treatment resistance and enable synthetic lethal approaches to increase cure rates."

This RM1 proposal focuses on defining and characterizing the integrated systems that support
intracellular organelle transport and placement. Rather than just characterizing “molecules” as
biophysicists or “organelle dynamics” as cell biologists, our goal is to achieve an atomic-to-

collaborative and multi-disciplinary research team will discover and study the native
microenvironments in cells and in vitro, by considering physiologically-relevant combinations of
molecular motors, filaments, adaptors, membranes and other cofactors that control organelle
movement and polarization. We will use mitochondria as our initial model system, as many key
molecules and signaling pathways that are essential for the dynamics of this organelle have
already been described. We will uncover the roles of spatial organization and dynamic
assembly of filaments, mechanical forces, motor activity, and other regulatory elements will be
investigated. We will reconstitute complex microenvironments in vitro to determine motile and
anchoring mechanisms. We will computationally model these systems and experimentally test
models directly in cells and in vivo. Our research team will be energized and expanded by
implementing an Exploratory Pilot Studies Program to incorporate promising early-stage-
investigators into our collaborative team."
10818156,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Recent studies in humans have suggested that psychedelic drugs have therapeutic potential for several
mental health disorders, including substance use disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. For example,
psilocybin, a hallucinogenic compound present in several species of the genus Psilocybe, has been shown to
reduce cigarette smoking in humans. Studies in animals using other psychedelic compounds, including
those acting at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor subtype, have demonstrated that these drugs can have similar
effects on the motivational properties of drugs of abuse. However, no studies have examined the effects of
psilocybin in an animal model of nicotine self-administration, which is a major goal of this study.
Further, the subjective effects of psilocybin are variable, and influenced by both the internal state of the
individual (“set”) and the environmental conditions in which the drug is administered (“setting”). For
example, humans experiencing anxiety in an unknown environment are more likely to experience negative
subjective effects which may be counterproductive from a therapeutic perspective. However, these issues
of set and setting have never been investigated in any animal model of psychedelic effects.
Thus, the overall hypothesis of this proposal is that the potential of psilocybin as a treatment for smoking
can be modelled in animal models of nicotine reinforcement, and that this therapeutic potential depends
on the subjects’ internal state and environmental conditions. We will first test the hypothesis that a single
administration of psilocybin is sufficient to reduce nicotine motivation during nicotine self-administration
in rats, and that this treatment will have an enduring effect on later tests of cue-induced reinstatement,
which is an animal model of relapse. To manipulate the internal state of the individual (set), we will use a
conditioned emotional response (CER) procedure to induce positive or negative emotional states before the
psilocybin administration. To manipulate setting, rats will be administered psilocybin either in their
homecages or in a mildly aversive, novel environment.
When these experiments are complete, we will have established whether the therapeutic effects of
psilocybin can be modelled in rats, which will enable future neurobiological studies. Further, if set and
setting manipulations significantly alter the behavioral response to psilocybin, this will help identify the
neurobiological correlates of these manipulations, which may enable the identification of pharmacological
and/or non-pharmacological adjuncts to psychedelic psychotherapy."
10820509,"Summary:
The human genome is highly dynamic, yet the principles governing its movement are not known. Locally,
chromatin undergoes constant remodeling and rearrangement associated with processes such as
transcription, replication and DNA repair. At large length scales, chromatin dynamics is coherent over microns
and seconds. How the local gene-level processes contribute to nucleus-wide chromatin motions remains an
open question. To address this question, our overall approach is to map spatially and temporally resolved
chromatin dynamics across the nucleus in mammalian cells in vivo, while connecting it with motion and
transcriptional activity of specific genomic loci in real time. To do so, we will develop crosscutting tools
integrating synergistically quantitative approaches derived from the physical sciences with the latest
techniques from molecular biology and biochemistry. We will build an integrated experimental and analytical
platform enabling simultaneous measurements of nucleus-wide and gene-specific motions in real time in vivo
(Aim 1). Specifically, we will establish a data collection and analytical pipeline mapping chromatin motions
across the nucleus in vivo using displacement correlation spectroscopy (DCS), while monitoring motions of
genes visualized by CRISPR/dCas9 technology and tracked via new machine-learning assisted algorithms. In
addition, our platform will monitor the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of chromatin across nucleus and toggle
transcriptional activity of the tracked genes. Using this integrated platform, we will address the fundamental
question of how gene-level transcription activity contributes to genome-wide motions (Aim 2). We will measure
maps of chromatin motions and compaction across the whole genome, while simultaneously determining the
local compaction and mobility of specific genes (MUC4, IL6) as a function of their transcriptional activity. Our
findings will paint a new picture of the complexity and interconnectedness of gene- and genome-level
dynamics and spatial heterogeneity. Finally, we will extend this approach to study interphase chromatin
dynamics and compaction before and after cell differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (Aim 3). By
linking gene-level activity to genome-wide compaction and motions, these results will have important
implications for elucidating the role of chromatin dynamics in gene regulation and expression. Moreover, such
knowledge will provide a framework for a mechanistic picture of chromatin dynamics in mammalian cells."
10820511,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute kidney injury is a devastating complication of cirrhosis (Cirr-AKI). Current Cirr-AKI guidelines
recommend all patients receive 1 g/kg/day of IV albumin for two days regardless of presenting features.
However, Cirr-AKI presents heterogeneously, often with overlapping causes of injury and evolving clinical
courses. Thus, this “one size fits all approach” may harm patients with pre-existing intravascular overload
and/or molecular features suggesting high risk of lung vascular leakage. Moreover, there is no guidance when
to stop albumin or how to define “adequate” repletion. Therefore, there is a critical unmet need for
personalizing resuscitation among Cirr-AKI patients to improve clinical outcomes and avoid complications of
volume overload. We approach this challenge with parallel and complementary aims. First, several studies
have shown that systemic inflammation and disruption of vascular integrity may be implicated in the
hemodynamic dysfunction of Cirr-AKI. Patients with less vascular inflammation may be more likely to respond
to albumin and less likely to be suffer adverse effects such as pulmonary edema due to capillary leak. Using
data and samples from two large and previously published biobanks, we will establish subphenotypes of Cirr-
AKI that respond well (or poorly) to established treatments using clinical, physiological, and molecular data.
Second, we aim to better define intravascular volume status using Point of Care Ultrasound (POCUS), an
emerging technique well-established in the critical care literature as an objective, reliable, and inexpensive tool
to gauge intravascular volume. Addition of this tool to current standard of care for Cirr-AKI may maximize the
chance of reaching euvolemia and/or reduce IV albumin administration to those already adequately
resuscitated or overloaded. We will perform a pilot trial assessing how a POCUS-guided treatment protocol
affects kidney outcomes and influences practice patterns around IV albumin prescription in Cirr-AKI.
Successful execution of these aims will illuminate new directions for diagnosis, therapeutic monitoring, and
tailored interventions for Cirr-AKI. In concert with training in trial design, vascular biology, and fostering a
national network of leaders in Cirr-AKI research, support from the K23 will enable a skill set that is applicable to
clinical trial work across the broader landscape of kidney injury, provide a springboard to an independent
academic career in nephrology, and build towards a multicenter collaborative network in a future R01 award."
10823016,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Among the estimated 11 million care partners who provide care to persons with Alzheimer’s
Disease (AD) and AD-Related Dementias (ADRD), many are tasked with the management of
dysphagia (swallowing difficulty) and they experience higher levels of emotional burden,
isolation, depression, and hopelessness than their counterparts who do not manage dysphagia.
Care partners have the potential to optimize outcomes for people living with AD/ADRD but only
if they are well-supported. Unfortunately, existing interventions focused on dysphagia
management do not address the range of unique needs of AD/ADRD care partners.
To address this important problem - and in response to Funding Opportunity Announcement
PAS-22-197 - we propose to co-design and create Dementia IDEAs (Improving Dysphagia
Education and Actions), an evidence-based intervention for dysphagia management with digital
training content and behavioral nudges designed for AD/ADRD care partners.
In this Phase I project, we will follow the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stage Model for
Behavioral Intervention Development and we will employ a user-centered design approach to
address the first two stages (Stage 0 and Stage 1A) to assess needs and co-design the
Dementia IDEAs prototype. First, in Stage 0 (Needs Assessment), we will assess the needs of
AD/ADRD care partners who manage dysphagia for people living with AD/ADRD. Next, in
Stage 1A (Participatory Co-design), we will co-design the Dementia IDEAs intervention that will
provide digital content and behavioral nudges to support dysphagia management collaboratively
with care partners and dysphagia care experts.
Our goal is to commercialize the intervention to help care partners anticipate, avert, and
respond to challenges during the course of AD/ADRD and enhance health and well-being. In
particular, we aim to influence AD/ADRD care partners’ knowledge, skills, behavior, and habits

care partners and persons living with AD/ADRD."

Proper mitotic spindle positioning and orientation of the cell division plane is imperative for tissue morphogenesis,
development, and determination of cell fate. When the spindle is mislocalized or the division plane is askew,
defects impacting the genetic content of daughter cells, tissue architecture, and development of tumors may
arise. In vertebrates, cytoplasmic dynein and its cortically localized regulators, such as Leu/Gly/Asn-repeat
containing protein (LGN) anchor the spindle and provide the mechanical force needed to move the spindle into
its proper position and orientation. The location of this spindle positioning machinery is, in turn, controlled by a
variety of factors including polarity proteins, cell-cell junctions, or both, depending on the cellular context. In
addition, studies going back more than a century have identified the so-called “default” spindle positioning
mechanism, wherein the spindle spontaneously positions itself parallel to the longest axis of the cell and
perpendicular to its shortest axis. In the absence of any other information, this default mode of spindle placement
ensures formation of two equally-sized daughter cells.
The small GTPase, Cdc42, has been repeatedly implicated as an upstream participant in spindle orientation in
a variety of organisms and tissues, based largely on knockdown or knockout approaches. However, the means
by which Cdc42 controls spindle positioning is poorly understood, in part because it can impact many processes
known to be involved in spindle positioning including cell polarity, cell-cell junction formation, and cell-substrate
adhesion formation. Further, almost nothing is known about Cdc42 dynamics during spindle positioning. Our
preliminary data show that Cdc42 is present in propagating cortical waves during spindle positioning in Xenopus
embryos, and that experimental suppression of these Cdc42 waves results in inappropriately positioned
cleavage planes, a hallmark of mispositioned or misoriented spindles. I will use a combination of imaging, global
and optogenetic manipulation of Cdc42, and knockdown approaches in intact Xenopus embryos and dissociated
blastomeres to test the hypotheses that Cdc42 controls proper spindle positioning and to test whether it acts on
the spindle positioning machinery directly or whether it acts through upstream control mechanisms such as cell
polarization.
In Aim 1, I will assess the role of Cdc42 in spindle positioning in intact embryos and dissociated blastomeres via
both global and optogenetically controlled Cdc42 wave modulation. This will allow me to determine where and
when in the spindle positioning hierarchy Cdc42 acts. In Aim 2, I will identify the Cdc42 activator, GEF, and
inactivator, GAP, responsible for regulating Cdc42 waves. This will allow me to understand the molecular
regulation of cortical Cdc42 dynamics during spindle positioning, and provide a complementary approach for
wave manipulation. Collectively, these studies will reveal how Cdc42 controls proper spindle positioning in a
vertebrate model."

Intraoperative ophthalmic visualization saves the vision of tens of millions of people annually. A large portion of
surgical interventions requires manipulation of fine and sensitive layered tissue structures with micrometer-level
thickness that cannot be directly visualized with standard microscopy. Intraoperative Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT) is an established imaging technology in ophthalmic clinics. Despite strong clinical indications
about the benefits of intraoperative OCT, common implementations of intraoperative OCT cannot provide the
performance required for intraoperative applications. All commercial implementations are based on Spectral-
Domain OCT, a technology that has limitations on the imaging depth and speed and on its ability to image moving
tissue. While Swept-Source OCT does not suffer from any of these limitations, its integration in the operating
room has been limited by technology readiness challenges. Recent progress on optics and algorithms for
SSOCT has highlighted a new potential to translate high-performance versions of the technology to the operating
rooms. High-speed and long-range lasers are now available commercially, and image analyses with artificial
intelligence are more advanced and faster to develop. Progress on the optics and algorithms fronts put extra
demand on the performance of the system's electronics that cannot be met using today’s architectures. To
provide the required OCT imaging needs where large volumes are scanned in real-time to cover the dynamically
changing operating zone, it is imperative to rethink the electronic architecture in modern ways with a completely
new approach. To achieve this goal, we are developing a novel electronics board that does not follow the
traditional architecture based on discrete components communicating via buses and hand-shacking protocols.
The board we are developing in this project is based on a Radio-Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC). This
architecture will enable real-time OCT volume imaging with 3x improvement in axial resolution, 4x in field of view,
and more than 10x in latency or the state-of-the-art research and development efforts in this field. The board we
are developing provides a versatile, unique, and highly-configurable solution for intraoperative SSOCT systems
at competitive cost, space, and power requirements. The development will offer a unique integration of features
needed for systems with virtually zero latency requirements."

This F31 proposal describes a comprehensive training and mentorship program for Belle Henry, a Ph.D.
candidate in the Immunology program at the University of Michigan. Ms. Henry will participate in a rigorous
didactic and laboratory training curriculum, supervised by her mentor as well as support from a multi-disciplinary
mentorship and dissertation committee. Her training program will include supervised molecular, structural, and
biochemical training, as well as mentored opportunities to engage in scientific writing, presentations, and grant
applications. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to best position Ms. Henry for an independent and productive
scientific career. Diabetes is a global epidemic of increasing prevalence, where all forms of diabetes are linked
by insufficient β-cell function or mass to meet peripheral insulin demands. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is caused by a
combination of both intrinsic β cell dysfunction and dysregulation of the immune system, thus leading to
autoimmune attack and β cell demise. As β cells are uniquely sensitive to inflammatory damage, therapies
targeting the β cell present opportunities for treatment of T1D. The long-term objective of my project is to
better understand the molecular mechanisms that govern β-cell responses to inflammatory challenge and gain
greater insight into the mechanisms that regulate β cell survival. My project focuses on the β-cell-specific role of
leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), a kinase that phosphorylates Rab GTPases to regulate membrane
trafficking. My preliminary data indicate that LRRK2 is transcriptionally induced in β cells following cytokine
exposure, and pharmacologic inhibition of LRRK2 protects β cells against pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced
death. The overall objective of my project is to understand the role of LRRK2 in β-cell responses to
inflammatory toxicity. LRRK2 has been shown to regulate mitophagy in other cell types, and previous work from
the Soleimanpour lab demonstrates that β cells regulate mitochondrial turnover to promote cell survival in pro-
inflammatory contexts. Thus, I hypothesize that in response to inflammatory damage, LRRK2 modulates β cell
survival through regulation of mitophagy, which I will test through 2 Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine the
importance of LRRK2 to β cell function and survival in mouse models of β cell inflammation and primary human
islets. Aim 2 will elucidate the mechanistic impact of LRRK2 induction on mitochondrial quality control following
inflammatory damage by examining its role in mitophagy. Successful completion of these Aims will provide novel
and critical insights into the mechanistic responses of β cells to inflammatory stimuli that could be targeted to
defend β-cells to treat or prevent diabetes."

Mechanosensitivity and mechanotransduction are fundamental processes that affect virtually all aspects of
human physiology. Sensitivity to mechanical stimuli ranges from light touch to unpleasant or painful and relies
on the ability of primary sensory afferents to transduce these stimuli into electrical signaling. In humans,
dysfunctions of the somatosensory system have only symptomatic or palliative care, largely because the
molecular and cellular aspects of mechanosensitivity and mechanotransduction, and the sequence of events
that underlies somatosensory tuning remain enigmatic. Our long-term goal is to understand general principles
somatosensory mechanotransduction under normal, adaptive, and pathological conditions.
In this collaborative basic scientific proposal, we seek to uncover the mechanism underlying adaptations of
mammalian mechanosensory system to cold. We will approach this problem using a novel model organism—
hibernating thirteen-lined ground squirrel (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus). Despite the prolonged severe
hypothermia during hibernation, when body temperature drops to less than 10°C, squirrels maintain the ability
to detect mechanical force and can be aroused by touch and vibration. The endurance of the sense of touch
despite prolonged hypothermia supports the existence of specific molecular and cellular adaptations at the level
of peripheral mechanoreceptors. We seek to uncover these adaptations by biophysical analysis of ion channels
in peripheral mechanoreceptors that determine baseline excitability, convert touch into excitation and generate
and propagate action potential, implementing a mechanosensory tune-up that preserve touch sensitivity despite
prolonged exposure to cold. This proposal will elucidate tunable molecular pathways in mammalian
mechanosensory neurons to inform clinical practices mitigating somatosensory dysfunctions following
hypothermia or nerve damage."

 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is associated with excellent cure rates. Despite early disease control, this success
comes at considerable cost, with treatment-induced morbidity (“late effects” [LE]) that manifests as early as a
year after therapy (e.g., 2nd cancers, cardiovascular [CVD] disease), compromised health-related quality of life
(HRQL), and early mortality. Over the past 20 years, while important HL clinical trials have been conducted,
there has been a lack of consensus about the preferred approach to treatment, considering both short- and
longer term outcomes. While clinical trials provide rich information about short term disease outcomes, they do
not follow efficacy beyond 5 years and rarely track post-therapy morbidity. In contrast, HL registries capture
longitudinal outcomes and can be linked to other sources including healthcare utilization via administrative
claims and cancer registries to characterize LE and survival. This proposal represents an unprecedented
opportunity to draw on the collective expertise of International clinical HL oncology experts, epidemiologists,
imaging experts, and methods & modeling experts with access to individual patient data from modern HL clinical
trials and real-world registries from across the world. In preparation for the project, we harmonized individual
patient data (IPD) for >12,000 HL patients from 12 clinical trials and 4 large HL registries. Building on data
science principles, we established a common data model & unifying data dictionary, which allows us to expand
the current database over time, incorporating future data as they become available. We will harness these multi-
source data to first, create a modern prediction model via predictive modeling of pre-treatment clinical factors;
second, we will estimate and validate disease progression and early emergent late effects, enhanced by the
addition of interim PET imaging data and alternative treatment options via multi-state Cox proportional hazards
models to estimate transition probabilities; and third, we will generate a dynamic decision model to project
precalculated outcomes of interest, such as short term and longer term outcomes, including HRQL, The
aggregated, “standardized” precalculated visualizations/projections (life expectance and quality-adjusted life
years) will provide a basis for comparing alternative treatments for a broad range of disease subgroups and
patient characteristics “on the fly.” Furthermore, both the results of the statistical models & parameter estimates
from the simulation model will be validated and re-calibrated as needed in large external cohorts (i.e., German
Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) clinical trials data and Dutch HL registry). The simulation model will then be
converted to open source, which will allow local analyses that go beyond our precalculated standard scenarios.
Our three-step approach (predictive modeling to multi-state modeling to simulation/decision modeling) will be
designed to incorporate future prospective data as new/novel treatments, and knowledge emerges over time.
Overall, this project’s results will be significant as they are expected to delineate precise outcomes & optimal
therapy for individual HL patients and inform the development of models and paradigms for other diseases."

Mal-adaptations to stress often leads to impaired social behavior, a shared domain across many neuropsychiatric conditions. While it is well-established that environmental factors, such as stress, play an etiology role, the brain mechanisms, particularly the role of specific neural circuits mediating the maladaptive responses, remain to be elucidated. Chronic social defeat stress (cSDS) in mice is a highly relevant, validated model to study brain circuit mechanisms related to stress. cSDS has been shown to induce morphological and functional changes in multiple brain regions including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which contains heterogeneous cell types and is interconnected with other limbic brain regions. Using recently developed neuronal activity reporter mouse lines, termed fosTRAP and TRAP2, the applicants’ laboratories have determined that acute (aSDS) and chronic (cSDS) social defeat stress activate distinct populations of projection neurons in the mPFC. The goal of this study is to determine whether specific circuit connectivity is pertinent to stress-induced social impairment and if novel therapeutic intervention strategies could be devised to selectively target the relevant circuits to combat the social deficits and alleviate off target effects. The expertise of two laboratories (Ferguson- mouse behavior, molecular biology and bioinformatics; Qiu-neurophysiology and functional circuit mapping, optogenetics) will be combined to test the hypothesis that cSDS-induced, impaired social behaviors are encoded within a specific neural circuit in the mPFC. The PIs will employ a TRAP2 reporter mouse line to gain genetic access to the mPFC neurons that are activated by cSDS, followed by investigation of: Aim 1) whether disrupted synaptic homeostasis selectively occurs in NAc-projecting mPFC neuronal populations that are activated by the cSDS, and whether disrupted synaptic homeostasis occurs selectively in the mice susceptible to social impairment. In Aim 2, this team will use targeted optogenetic manipulation of neural activity in the cSDS-activated mPFC projection neurons that also selectively express excitatory or inhibitory opsins. The investigators will test the novel hypothesis that optogenetic inhibition of this specific neuron ensemble during the cSDS confers resilience, while repeated activation of these neurons leads to susceptibility to social impairments. Aim 3 will investigate potential dysregulated gene networks in cSDS-activated mPFC neurons and to what extent such changes depend on SIRT1, a major human genetic risk factor for depression, through an innovative combination of cSDS in TRAP2 and RiboTag mice and bioinformatics analyses on RNAseq data collected from both male and female mice. Impact: Successful completion of these aims could reveal a paradigm-shifting practice in circuit-based therapeutics aimed at restoring prefrontal synaptic homeostasis and could establish a specific corticolimbic circuit as a lead intervention target for preventing the development of stress induced circuit pathology, which is otherwise not possible by previous studies examining an indiscriminate wholesale population of PFC neurons."

Despite substantial knowledge of the molecular and genetic mechanisms contributing to amyloid pathology,
very little is known about how these molecular mechanisms affect the operation of neural circuits, and how this
disrupts neural computation to ultimately produce behavioral deficits in Alzheimer's. Here we seek to
understand the mechanisms underlying two emerging early biomarkers — auditory gap detection deficits and
functional disconnection of cortical networks — and how these are mechanistically related to one another. The
objective of this proposal is to determine when and how network function is disrupted in auditory and other
cortical areas, and how this impairs behavioral gap detection in the 5XFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's. Our
central hypothesis is that gap detection deficits result from specific disruption of gap detection circuits in
auditory cortex, as a consequence of large-scale network disruption both within and among cortical areas. Aim
1 will determine the computational mechanisms underlying progressive network disruption. Our working
hypothesis is that network disruption is not just a global degradation, but occurs specifically as a loss of hub
neurons over time, disconnecting modules and cortical areas. Aim 2 will determine how network disruption
affects the flow of feedforward and feedback information across the cortical hierarchy. Our working hypothesis
is that top-down feedback projections are impaired earlier and more profoundly than feedforward projections.
Aim 3 will determine how network disruption impairs the computation of gap selectivity in auditory cortex, and
how this impairs gap detection behavior. Our working hypothesis is that gap selectivity is computed in the
superficial layers and impacts behavior via output from layer 5. We will test these hypotheses with a
combination of chronic mesoscopic 2-photon GCaMP8f imaging, high-density electrophysiology, and
quantitative behavior in 5XFAD mice. The proposed research is innovative because it uses novel
imaging/electrophysiology approaches to address how molecular pathology disrupts the operation of neural
circuits, and how this in turn disrupts neural computation to produce early-onset behavioral deficits. The
proposed research is significant because it will provide a detailed cellular- and synaptic-level mechanistic
explanation of the nature of large-scale network disruptions in Alzheimer's, and reveal how these disruptions
affect specific neural computations in auditory cortical circuits that produce specific behavioral deficits. This
understanding will deepen and extend the validity of both gap detection and fMRI functional connectivity
measures as early biomarkers for Alzheimer's, and provide insight into the nature of the window of opportunity
for potential therapeutic intervention during synaptic network impairment before permanent structural damage
occurs."
10809030,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Methodological advances that allow for rapid and efficient access to a wide range of functionalized
heterocycles are imperative for streamlining drug discovery processes. Given the vast ubiquity of heterocycles
in bioactive compounds, the functionalization of existing heterocycles is a common strategy used to tune
important pharmacological properties of drugs. Cyclopropanations of heterocycles represent a particularly
attractive strategy to achieve synthetic diversification, as the corresponding fused bicyclic frameworks are not
only present in bioactive small molecules, but are key chemical synthons en route to more complex scaffolds.
The resultant motifs are classified as donor-acceptor cyclopropanes (or push-pull cyclopropanes) and exhibit
unique proclivities toward cyclopropane ring opening and subsequent reactivity. Transition metal complexes
have been used to access these important synthetic frameworks through metal-carbenoid cyclopropanation
reactions, however many of these strategies suffer from low levels of chemo and/or stereoselectivity or depend
on a specific class of carbene precursor to achieve high selectivity. Alternatively, enzymes can impart exquisite
chemo-, regio-, and stereoselectivities in reactions that are challenging in small molecule catalysis. Directed
evolution has provided a powerful platform by which Nature’s enzymes can be repurposed to develop new-to-
nature chemical transformations, including engineered P450 enzymes capable of olefin cyclopropanation and
C‒H functionalization. The focus of this proposal is to expand the breadth of activity of engineered iron-heme
carbenes to include cyclopropanations of heterocycles and to investigate their capacity to elicit cascade reactions
on the corresponding cyclopropanes. The specific aims are (1) to evolve hemoprotein variants capable of
catalyzing asymmetric cylopropanations of heteroarenes, (2) to expand the scope of this activity to a variety of
N-heterocycles, particularly those with no current asymmetric counterpart, and (3) to exploit the hydrogen-
bonding network of enzymes to harness the ring-opening reactivity of the corresponding push-pull
cyclopropanes. The overall goal is to develop an enzyme-controlled chemodivergent platform for the diversified
synthesis of functionalized heterocycles. On a practical level, such a development would represent a powerful
tool for medicinal chemists and would provide rapid and efficient access to privileged molecular frameworks in a
library fashion. Fundamentally, the proposed research will expand our understanding of enzymatic cascade
reactions and explore new catalytic processes that could inspire developments across all pillars of catalysis."

The candidate’s long-term career goal is to lead an independent research program focused on defining
mechanisms that govern gut microbiome-host interactions in chronic heart failure and to translate this
knowledge into novel preventative and therapeutic targets. This research program will pave the path for gut
microbiome-focused precision medicine approaches in heart failure.
The candidate will use the structured environment of the K08 award to acquire advanced research expertise in
microbiome meta-transcriptomic and time-series analyses, integrative multi-omic data analysis, clinical
research methods, as well as targeted professional development skills in mentorship, scientific communication,
grantsmanship, and leadership. This will be accomplished in the context of investigating longitudinal gut
microbiome-host interactions in chronic heart failure and how these relate to disease pathophysiology and
progression. The candidate will leverage a longitudinal multi-omic and clinical dataset from a cohort of 60
patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, previously recruited by the candidate as part
of her NHLBI-funded F32. The first aim will examine the relationship between gut microbial Bifidobacterium-
based functional guild and heart failure severity and outcomes. The second aim will elucidate shifts in the host
immune profile, gut microbiome composition and function, and heart failure disease status following a targeted
Bifidobacterium probiotic intervention. A new cohort of patients with stable chronic heart failure with reduced
ejection fraction will be recruited for this aim. This project will uncover mechanisms by which the gut
microbiome interacts with different facets of host biology, which is expected to provide novel insight into
disease pathophysiology and explain heterogeneity in heart failure progression. This knowledge will translate
into better disease risk stratification and identify new therapeutic targets in heart failure.
The proposed project will be performed under the guidance of an expert mentorship team comprised of world-
leading experts in host-microbiome multi-omics (Dr. Snyder), mechanistic microbiome research (Drs.
Sonnenburg and Tang), and heart failure translational research and clinical trials (Drs. Tang and Khush). They
will provide complementary expertise in skills applied in this project and support the candidate's career
development. The rich multidisciplinary environment at Stanford is optimal for this research proposal and
provides an ideal setting for the candidate’s development into an independent researcher. At the culmination of
this proposal, the candidate will gain the necessary expertise and preliminary data for an R01 proposal to
identify synergistic microbiome-host pathways that underlie heart failure pathophysiology. As an independent
physician-scientist, the candidate will use gut microbiome-based precision medicine approaches to improve the
outcomes of patients she cares for as a heart failure physician."
10807280,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) are impacted by high rates of cigarette smoking and low quit rates. As
such, there is a need to intervene on tobacco use among individuals with BD though, to date, there remain few
effective treatments for addressing tobacco use in this population. Delay discounting, or the tendency to
devalue a reward with increasing time to reward receipt, is a mechanistic process that is common to both BD
and tobacco use. Specifically, studies suggest that individuals with BD and tobacco use, respectively, prefer
smaller, immediate, rewards over larger, delayed rewards. The goal of this proposal is to assess the feasibility
and acceptability of a 6-session episodic future thinking intervention (“Future Self-BD”) for decreasing delay
discounting among individuals with BD and comorbid tobacco use disorder. Future Self-BD involves the vivid
mental simulation of positive future events that participants anticipate will be benefited by smoking cessation.
The primary hypotheses of this study are that Future Self-BD will be highly acceptable and feasible. We also
hypothesize that, as exploratory outcomes, Future Self-BD will be associated with reductions in delay
discounting as well as increased likelihood of attempting any smoking cessation treatment, increased
motivation to quit smoking, and increased self-efficacy for smoking abstinence, compared to a control
intervention (Daily Check-Ins). All participants will also receive brief cognitive-behavioral based smoking
cessation counseling. The proposed study will occur alongside core training activities to establish expertise in
the development and adaptation of psychosocial interventions (especially for serious mental illness), clinical
trials methodology for tobacco use disorder, and advanced statistical modeling. The training plan will be
implemented under the expert guidance of Dr. Louisa Sylvia (Primary Mentor), Dr. A. Eden Evins (Co-Mentor),
Dr. Dustin Rabideau (Advisor), Dr. Leonard Epstein (Consultant), and Dr. Warren Bickel (Consultant). This
combined research and training program will enable the candidate to become an independent clinical research
scientist specializing in the intersection between serious mental illness and comorbid substance use disorders.
There is a need for adjunctive behavioral interventions that can address the burden of tobacco use in BD, and
this intervention holds great promise as a potential pathway for decreasing the over-valuation of short-term
rewards that is in turn linked to smoking behavior."

The goal of this proposal is to identify genes that affect behaviors associated with substance use disorders (SUD)
using a novel mechanism-to-gene strategy. Standard genome wide association strategies applied to behavior in
humans or model organisms have not so far provided much mechanistic insight into the origins of psychiatric
disease. In this project we address this problem by genetic mapping of circuit-driven behavioral output. We
examine a circuit involved in anxiety-related behaviors that are comorbid with SUD. Optogenetic activation of
this circuit, from the ventral hippocampus (vCA1) to lateral hypothalamus (LH), results in large quantitative
differences in anxiety-related behaviors in different inbred mouse strains. These differences are highly heritable
and amenable to genetic mapping. Since a circuit's function arises from a limited set of cellular and anatomic
features, identifying the genes that are involved in circuit function will generate hypotheses on the mechanisms
underlying the behavioral differences and hence of SUD. We will identify the genes and likely mechanisms
through three aims: 1) determine heritability and behavioral variation of optogenetic activation of the vCA1-LH
pathway in eight inbred strains 2) genetically map optogenetically-evoked behaviors of the vCA1-LH pathway
using 800 diversity outbred mice derived from those eight strains, and 3) apply quantitative complementation
tests to find which genes act through the vCA1-LH pathway to alter the behavioral function of this pathway.
These experiments will allow us to identify where and how in the brain genetic variation gives rise to behavioral
variation, and will demonstrate the importance of integrating systems neuroscience and genetic approaches."

 Statins are the cornerstone for preventing and treating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), the
leading cause of death worldwide. Yet even the highest-risk patients face challenges initiating and continuing
these low-cost, life-saving medications. Clinicians also fail to prescribe statins when indicated, and health
systems may lack the infrastructure to systematically monitor statin adherence. Thus, the objective of the
proposed study, Adherence Determinants in the Health Electronic Record Evaluation of Statins (ADHERES), is
to determine reasons for statin nonuse across diverse populations as a strategy to reduce health
disparities. Specifically, this study will fill the knowledge gap of why certain patient groups (historically
marginalized racial and ethnic groups, women, and older adults) are less likely to use statins by leveraging
electronic health record (EHR) data and targeted focus groups.
 Statin use is typically collected in discrete, structured EHR data fields. However, structured EHR data may be
incomplete, lack vital information about shared decision-making available around statin use, and fail to capture
the variety of reasons for statin nonuse. A better understanding of the patient, clinician, and health system factors
associated with statin nonuse thus requires the simultaneous study of structured, unstructured, and patient-
generated EHR data from different data sources and patient populations, and ascertaining patient and clinician
perspectives through qualitative approaches.
 To tackle this challenging public health problem, a multidisciplinary team that includes experts in preventive
cardiology, health equity research, biomedical informatics, implementation science, community partnerships,
and qualitive methods has been assembled. EHR data sources include ~3 million eligible patients from Stanford
Health Care, the Veterans Health Administration, and Houston Methodist. Aim 1 will characterize gaps in
guideline-directed statin use across diverse patient groups and clinical indications using structured and
unstructured EHR data and identify patient profiles and characteristics linked to statin nonuse. Aim 2 will
elucidate reasons for statin nonuse in unstructured EHR and patient-generated health data using large language
models. Aim 3 will validate and extend these reasons and co-design solutions to improve statin adherence
through 10 patient (n=80 participants) and 4 clinician (n=20 participants) focus groups in partnership with the
National Minority Health Alliance, a nonprofit organization committed to eliminating health disparities.
 Findings from ADHERES will be directly actionable in all three health systems by more accurately capturing
gaps in guideline-directed statin use, and lead to the implementation of user-centered interventions to address
identified barriers. This multi-pronged approach can be scaled beyond statins to improve adherence and the
equitable use of other guideline-directed, lifesaving cardiovascular treatments."

 Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a major public health problem in low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs). Globally, an estimated 30% of women report physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner in
their lifetime. IPV is a well-established social driver of mental health problems and doubles the rate of
depression and PTSD. Interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can improve depression after
women experiencing IPV exit abusive relationships. However, despite ongoing violence, many young women
in LMICs are less likely to divorce or separate from their husband. But ongoing IPV severely limits mental
health recovery and increases the risks of suicide. Another important factor in many LMICs is that young
women often live in extended, multi-generational households, where studies have shown that mother-in-laws
(MILs) play a critical role in young daughter-in-laws (DILs) autonomy and freedom of movement, substantially
affecting her mental health. The pathways via which multiple family members and ongoing IPV affect young
women’s mental health in LMICs is very poorly understood. There is an urgent need to study interventions
that: a) improve mental health and reduce IPV; b) engage husbands and MILs, and not just women
experiencing IPV; and c) elucidate pathways via which IPV-related drivers affect mental health. Our Nepal-
US collaborative team has pilot-tested a novel Multi-component family Intervention to Lower depression and
Address intimate Partner violence (MILAP, meaning unity and reconciliation in Nepali) among young women
in Nepal. MILAP’s first component engages DILs and their MILs by establishing them as allies in addressing
IPV and improving DIL’s empowerment and freedom of movement. In MILAP’s second component, the DIL
and her husband participate in behavioral couple’s therapy (BCT) to improve communication skills, increase
caring behaviors, and enhance trust in the marital relationship. This approach was acceptable, feasible, and
safe. It resulted in substantial reduction in proportion of people with moderate depression (PHQ-9>9)
(baseline: 46%, 3 months: 4%). Based on this pilot study (n=75; 25 triads), we now propose to conduct a fully-
powered RCT of MILAP to: a) establish effectiveness by conducting a 12-month RCT with 300 triads (young
women reporting IPV, their husbands, and their MILs), b) understand mechanism of intervention impact, and c)
conduct a costing analysis.
 Our team has a 16-year history of successful global health collaborative research in Nepal. If
successful, this study will deliver an effective family intervention and a better understanding of its
mechanism to address two complex challenges (IPV and depression) that lead to a massive public health
burden among young women living in Nepal, other LMICs, and other regions where women live in multi-
generational households and have limited options to leave abusive relationships."
10799149,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD) is a potentially lethal inherited disorder that
affects approximately 1/20,000 children and is genetically and clinically distinct from the more common
Autosomal Dominant PKD (ADPKD). ARPKD is characterized by diffuse kidney microcysts resulting from
fusiform dilatations of the collecting tubules. As these kidneys cysts accumulate, the kidneys do not show
progressive enlargement, but instead accumulate more cysts and eventually become progressively more fibrotic,
resulting in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Approximately 40-50% of ARPKD children who survive the
neonatal period progress to ESKD by age 18, highlighting the significant disease burden. Importantly, there are
currently no disease-specific clinically-available therapies for patients with ARPKD. Despite several
potential therapies showing promise in ARPKD animal models, clinical trials are currently limited by the lack
of sensitive measures for ARPKD kidney disease progression across the spectrum of disease.
Conventional clinical endpoints for CKD progression (e.g., decline in glomerular filtration rate, GFR) lack the
sensitivity to detect ARPKD progression in the time frame of a typical clinical trial, as the rates of GFR decline
are relatively small and variable among patients, especially those with milder disease. Imaging assessments of
total kidney volume, successfully utilized in ADPKD patients, are also not applicable to ARPKD as kidney size
stabilizes over time despite cystic kidney disease progression. Our collaborative multi-center research team
has shown in previous (preclinical) and current (clinical) NIH R01 studies that novel MR Fingerprinting (MRF,
cystic burden) and non-contrast kidney Arterial Spin Labeling MRI (ASL, perfusion): (1) can accurately detect
and stage ARPKD kidney disease; and (2) can measure significant kidney disease progression in ARPKD
patients before conventional GFR measures. The Aims of the proposed studies are 1) to determine the capability
of our multimodal MRI biomarkers to accurately and repeatably detect and stage ARPKD kidney disease across
the full spectrum of disease from early-stage CKD characterized by diffuse kidney cysts (MRF) and reduced
kidney perfusion (ASL) to later-stage CKD characterized by progressive kidney fibrosis (MR elastography, MRE);
(2) determine the sensitivity of these MRI biomarkers to detect changes in ARPKD kidney disease progression
over time in comparison to gold-standard GFR assessments; and (3) determine the feasibility of a new free-
breathing MRF methodology that would allow infants and young children to be scanned without sedation. For
these studies, we will recruit ARPKD patients ≥6 years of age with early, mild, and moderate CKD from across
the US for 4 annual multimodal MRI scans and GFR measurements at our two collaborating sites (CC/CWRU
and CHOP). Age-matched healthy controls will also be recruited for an MRI scan. If successful, the proposed
studies will support use of these multimodal MRI biomarkers as outcome measures and/or high risk subject
enrichment for future clinical trials for ARPKD patients."

While cancer cachexia is a devastating syndrome characterized by progressive muscle wasting, inflammation,
and metabolic disruption, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly characterized. There are currently no
treatments for cachexia. Cancer cachexia is driven by systemic inflammation, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and
apoptosis (“cellular debris”). A paradigm shift is emerging in understanding the resolution of inflammation as an
active biochemical process with our discovery of novel specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), such as
resolvins and endogenous resolution programs. SPMs stimulate macrophage-mediated clearance of debris,
promote tissue/muscle regeneration, and counter-regulate pro-inflammatory cytokines at nanogram doses
without immunosuppression. Despite approaches to block systemic inflammation, there are no current “pro-
resolving” therapies in cancer or cancer cachexia. Moreover, the impact of cancer cachexia on eicosanoids
and the novel pro-resolving lipid mediators, both key endogenous regulators of initiation and resolution of
inflammation, are unknown. This proposal builds on our recent finding that stimulating resolution of inflamma-
tion prevents tumor growth by counter-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines/eicosanoids and clearing debris.
Therefore, the overarching theme is to elucidate the underlying processes of failed resolution of inflamma-
tion that drive cancer cachexia. We will rely on a set of established experimental systems, including genetic
and pharmacological manipulation of SPMs and their receptors in animal models and macrophages. We shall
test this in a multi-pronged approach. In Specific Aim 1, the mechanisms of dysregulated resolution of in-
flammation in cachexia will be investigated. We will profile lipid autacoid mediators, including eicosanoids and
SPMs, to test our innovative hypothesis that failed resolution of inflammation is necessary and sufficient
to cause cachexia, which induces a rapid eicosanoid storm with dysregulated SPMs that leads to an un-
controlled cytokine storm. We will evaluate pro-resolving lipid mediators as interventional targets in ca-
chexia. In Specific Aim 2, we will optimize the delivery of SPM mimetics and humanized nano-pro-
resolving medicines (NPRMs) carrying SPM cargo to cachectic tissues and determine whether SPMs can
prevent chemotherapy-induced cachexia. These studies will complement Specific Aim 3, which seeks to pre-
vent cancer cachexia via stimulation of resolution by precision nutrition. Parabiosis studies will determine
whether cancer-induced cachexia is caused by an effect on the primary tumor or the metastatic site as most
patients with cachexia die from metastases. These studies can offer a new animal system to evaluate cachexia
at an early stage. We will connect our preclinical findings to clinical disease phenotypes using a computational
framework to understand failed inflammation resolution in cachexia. Since SPMs have proven safe and effec-
tive in human inflammatory disorders, these studies shall provide the basis for rapid translation of resolution-
directed treatments in humans as a new direction to potentially prevent and/or reverse cancer cachexia."

Women with dense breasts on mammogram have a 4-6-fold increased risk of breast cancer. A sizeable
proportion of premenopausal breast cancer cases (29%) are attributable to having dense breasts.
Observational and clinical trial data have shown that a decrease in breast density translates to a reduction in
breast cancer incidence. Hence, interventions to reduce breast density could prevent breast cancer. However,
adult dietary and lifestyle modifications have not been shown to reduce mammographic density. Therefore,
identifying a pathway that can be targeted to reduce breast density and breast cancer incidence is crucial. The
receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (RANK) pathway regulates the development of the lobulo-alveolar
mammary structures, activates downstream signaling cascades involved in breast cancer and is the major
mediator of progesterone-driven expansion of mammary stem cells. The RANK pathway is associated with
mammographic density and breast cancer risk. This has led to a strong interest in inhibiting RANK ligand
(RANKL) signaling to prevent breast cancer. Nevertheless, clinical trial data providing definitive evidence that
would allow the adoption of RANKL inhibition in reducing dense breasts and prevent breast cancer are not yet
available. We, thereby, propose to (i) perform a randomized clinical trial to quantify the effect of RANKL
inhibition with denosumab on mammographic density in high-risk premenopausal women with dense breasts
(Primary Aim); (ii) determine the effect of RANKL inhibition on breast tissue gene expression, metabolome,
and biomarkers associated with breast cancer (Secondary Aim). Approach: Study participants will be
randomized (1:1) to an intervention (N=105) or placebo arm (N=105). Intervention: The intervention arm will
receive two subcutaneous injections of denosumab (60 mg), one at baseline, and a second at 6 months. The
placebo arm will receive two subcutaneous placebo injections at baseline, and 6 months. We will use Volpara
software to assess mammographic density at baseline, and 12 months. Volpara quantifies volumetric
measures of density; volumetric percent density (VPD) allowing us to test differences in change in
mammographic density at 12 months among women assigned to intervention vs. placebo. Study population:
210 women undergoing annual screening mammography at the Siteman Cancer Center (SCC), St. Louis, MO.
Inclusion criteria: (i) premenopausal; (ii) ≥40 years of age; (iii) dense breasts (BI-RADS Category C and D –
equivalent to volumetric percent density ≥7.5% on Volpara. Target population: premenopausal women with
dense breasts aged ≥40 years undergo screening mammogram at the Joanne Knight Breast Health Center at
Siteman Cancer Center and affiliated hospitals. Impact: Study findings could open up additional therapeutic
approaches in primary breast cancer prevention for high-risk premenopausal women with dense breasts, who
do not have dominant genetic predisposition."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive, paralytic disorder characterized by the selective
loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. While most cases of ALS are sporadic, toxic gain-of-function
mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) are responsible for ~20% of all inherited forms of the disease.
Given its causative role in ALS, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and RNA interference (RNAi) have been
used to silence the expression of the mutant SOD1 protein. However, owing to their transient lifecycle, ASOs
will require a lifetime of costly, invasive administrations, while RNAi is prone to inducing off-target effects.
Conversely, while gene-editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, can be used be used to genetically
inactivate mutant SOD1, the implementation of these strategies for gene therapy could prove challenging, as
DNA editors can introduce off-target mutations and inadvertently create new, mutant SOD1 protein variants that
can compromise their safety. Thus, there remains a crucial need for therapies that can safely and efficiently
lower SOD1 for treatment of ALS.
An alternative technology that holds little risk for inducing DNA damage within a cell but could still be used to
efficiently lower SOD1 are RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 effectors. CRISPR-Cas13 systems possess the
programmability and versatility characteristic of DNA-editing CRISPR-Cas nucleases but pose limited risk for
inducing genotoxicity since they are unable to cleave DNA. Moreover, Cas13 proteins display favorable
specificity compared to gene silencing technologies and many are compact enough to fit within a single adeno-
associated virus (AAV) vector, a clinically promising gene delivery vehicle that can mediate long-term, cell-type
specific gene expression in the nervous system. Thus, CRISPR-Cas13 has the potential to safely and
persistently silence mutant SOD1 following just a single administration of an engineered viral vector. However,
it remains unknown whether Cas13 can be harnessed to reduce SOD1 in vivo and treat the disease.
The overarching objective of this proposal is to develop a gene therapy for ALS. Specifically, we propose to
harness CRISPR-Cas13d technology to lower mutant SOD1 in vivo for treatment of SOD1-linked ALS. In support
of the feasibility of this objective, our preliminary studies have demonstrated that Cas13 proteins are more active
and specific than a preclinically promising shRNA, that they can be delivered at high efficiencies by AAV9 to
spinal cord astrocytes, that they can efficiently lower mutant SOD1 protein throughout the spinal cord, and that
they can provide therapeutic benefit. We now aim to optimize the performance of this platform (Specific Aim 1)
for the goal of testing its efficacy in mouse models of ALS (Specific Aim 2) and to determine its safety as a gene
therapy agent (Specific Aim 3). Thus, by harnessing an innovative technology for transcriptional engineering that
can overcome the limitations of traditional gene-silencing, we will develop a new therapy for ALS, a debilitating
and currently incurable disorder with few effective treatment options."

Prevention, treatment, and cure of Type 2 diabetes requires understanding of the underlying causes, at the
genetic and/or pathophysiological level. In our laboratory we have long been interested in identifying underlying
causes leading to the disease. We have identified several underlying causes; in particular a reduction in insulin
compensation for insulin resistance (lowered Disposition Index) and reduced insulin clearance. We have
identified and additional potential factor – reduced Glucose Effectiveness (GE). The latter represents the ability
of glucose itself to self-normalize (after oral or intravenous administration) independent of a dynamic insulin
response. Yet the mechanisms underlying GE are not clearly understood. In this proposal we describe a
series of studies to identify underlying mechanisms. We propose that GE is reflective of the ability of the liver
to phosphorylate absorbed glucose via glucokinase (GCK), after which triose phosphates can be stored, utilized
for energy or exported as lactate. Studies are don in the dog model -- We will use glucose clamps at basal
insulin to measure GE; we will be able to quantitate liver glucose uptake and lactate export by arteriovenous
difference across the organ. Also, we will assess GCK and a panoply of the regulatory proteins directly by
biopsy of liver tissue, and other pathway components by biopsy of muscle and adipose. We compare GE with
insulin sensitivity using clamps. To test the importance of GCK activity (and glucokinase regulatory protein
(GKRP) we will either activate GCK with FGF1 or suppress GKRP with antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)
designed for our experiments. These experiments will test the hypothesis that GE measured in vivo is
determined by the activity of glucokinase in liver. We will examine the putative importance of GE itself in
experimental models of metabolic dysfunction, including obesity (overfeeding) and a model of prediabetes
(insulin resistance and mild β-cell dysfunction). We have proposed a computer model which allows for estimate
of hepatic glucokinase from the intravenous glucose tolerance test, by modeling the relationship between
plasma glucose and lactate. The validity of this model will be tested by determining its ability to detect increases
in GCK and GE due to FGF1 administration into the CNS (intranasal) and to assess increase in GE due to an
exercise regimen. These studies will, for the first time, elucidate the factors underlying glucose effectiveness,
and test the extent to which hepatic glucokinase activity can account for GE measured in vivo. We will provide
a model-based method to measure GE in vivo which can be applied to studies of the role of GE in pathogenesis
of metabolic disease including impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, PCOS, and others."

undergraduate trainees experienced hands- on training, didactic enrichment, and networking, emphasizing
research careers in substance abuse and addiction research. This renewal application will build upon best
practices and lessons learned to broaden access to 1) an inclusive and culturally aware environment 2)
resources for trainees to participate in cutting-edge research that complement the mission of NIDA (e.g.,
students, infrastructure, and programs); and 3) mentoring excellence and mentoring networks for applying to
and making decisions of graduate schools. The expected impact is a sustainable program that leads to trainees

10810011,"Health disparities for under-represented racial and ethnic groups with autism have persisted for
decades. For example, children who are Black and Hispanic with autism are identified at later ages than
White children despite there being no biologically plausible reason for delays in diagnosis. This suggests
that other systemic barriers likely contribute to lower prevalence rates and delayed identification. There is
a growing awareness that developmental screening instruments could potentially contribute to these
disparities. That is, many front-line screeners perform poorly when the child is Black or Hispanic (e.g.,
Dahl, et al, in press; Moody, et al, 2018; Rosenberg, et al, 2019). While previous research has found that
these instruments are not as accurate for autism identification in Black and Hispanic children, there is no
research available determining whether items within these screeners contribute to the poorer
identification, or if differential item functioning (DIF) impacts the overall performance of these screeners.
 This project will use factor analytic and item response theory methods to identify specific items
that differentially perform across Black, Hispanic, and White children on the two most widely used
screening tools for children 3 to 5 years old (Social Communication Questionnaire and Social
Responsiveness Scales). We will then use a recently published method to quantify the impact that DIF has
on overall instrument performance. To do this we will 1) determine if the SRS and SCQ factor structures
are consistent across groups; 2) use Item Response Theory (IRT) to measure test level and item level effect
sizes; 3) use a new method by Gonzalez and Pelham (2021) to determine if items that have Differential
Item Functioning (DIF) impact the overall performance of the instruments; and 4) conduct a sensitivity
analysis to determine if race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status or other demographic variables impact the
outcomes.
 This will be a secondary analysis of data from the Study to Explore Early Development (SEED), the
largest case-control study of autism risk factors in the world. SEED has an extremely well characterized
and diverse sample. Data come from six states (California, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina,
and Pennsylvania) and includes over 7,271 children. This research will allow for more effective
developmental screening and reduce early identification health disparities for Black and Hispanic children.
Findings from this study will reduce the public health burden of later identified autism in Black and
Hispanic populations by leading to improved screening algorithms that improve the early identification
process resulting early intervention for young children."

 Over the last 20 years, rigorous research has amassed a body of evidence documenting the
importance of communication to improve patient care in oncology. Previous literature has highlighted the need
for communication models and the need to improve communication for routine clinical oncology practice from
the time of diagnosis and across the trajectory.
 This R25 application supports an innovative skills development program to educate an interdisciplinary
cohort of nurses, social workers and chaplains to meet the nation's need for effective patient and family
communication in oncology. By utilizing a skills-based innovative program, this proposal will equip and expand
the workforce to meet a critical need. The Specific Aims are:
 Specific Aim 1: Apply a pilot tested Interprofessional Communication Curriculum for both an online and
classroom instruction format.
 Specific Aim 2: Deliver the curriculum in national workshops to competitively selected participants from
National Cancer Institute-designated clinical and comprehensive cancer centers, as well as community cancer
centers.
 Specific Aim 3: Evaluate the impact of the curriculum by measuring the process and outcomes of
participants' integrating the training to advance communication in oncology.
 Specific Aim 4: Disseminate findings through peer-reviewed publications, oncology organizations, and
professional networks, and develop a network of course participants to share experiences in improving
communication at participating cancer centers.
 Participation in this national training program will provide oncology professionals with the knowledge
and skills to facilitate systems and organizational changes to improve communication in their practice. A total
of 460 participants from cancer centers will participate in one of five courses."

The Summer Program in Neuroscience (SPIN) at Boston University School of Medicine is a unique, annual 8-
week program in which 10–15 undergraduate students perform mentored neuroscience research, receive
instruction in graduate-/medical-level neuroscience, and observe clinical activities focused on the diagnosis and
treatment of brain disorders. In the classroom, students meet with decorated medical school teaching faculty
and learn basic and clinical neuroscience through small-group interactive sessions, analysis of clinical and
research problems and cases, analysis of brain structure using microscopic brain sections and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans, as well as hands-on exploration and dissection of human brains. For the
research portion of the program, students are paired with a faculty member from a basic science or clinical
department and conduct a mentored research project, the results of which are presented at a public conference
that closes the session. In the clinic, students rotate on neurology and neurosurgery inpatient and outpatient
services, attend brain cuttings sessions in the hospital morgue, and review radiographic studies with working
neuroradiologists. These three aspects of the program intersect to generate a nuanced education in the structure
and function of the brain in health and disease from both research and clinical perspectives. To help participants
integrate SPIN experiences with their future, sessions are held that focus on scientific skills and career
development, including sessions on applying to graduate and medical schools, developing oral presentation
skills, and interview skills. End-of-program interviews with prior participants indicate students felt that SPIN was
a life-changing experience that encouraged and helped them pursue further graduate and medical education.
Although we have made every attempt to recruit students from traditionally underrepresented minority
backgrounds, the tuition-based model of our program has been a significant barrier. As a result, SPIN participants
have lacked the diversity that characterize the ideal clinical and research teams. Funding from this proposal
would subsidize the cost of participating in the program (tuition and housing) and provide stipend support for six
scholarships. We will target recruitment to outstanding underrepresented minority students in institutions and
biomedical conferences historically attended by these students, and restructure our application and our
admittance for tuition-based students to place an emphasis on accepting students who have demonstrated
commitment to diversity. We also propose to change the program to target specific scientific skills and expand
programming of career development. Finally, we will implement a thorough real-time tracking and evaluation
plan to follow our students and measure the impact of the program on their career choices through the
establishment of digitally-based interactions and communities. The goal of this proposal is to provide talented
students from underrepresented populations with access to formative experiences and training that will guide
them toward successful biomedical careers and thus diversify the biomedical workforce."

Promoting high quality communication in serious illness is a pressing national priority. However, traditional
approaches to measuring communication in the natural clinical setting are cumbersome, expensive, not
confidential and time-consuming. In order to understand, disseminate, support and incentivize high quality
communication, we need measurement methods that can be scaled for larger clinical studies and routine
health service quality reporting. This proposal leverages extraordinary data that we have at our disposal and
our team's expertise in machine learning to automatically measure features of serious illness communication
quality in the natural clinical setting. We focus on episodes of Connectional Silence that occur between
clinicians and patients because these moments are markers of effective listening, engaged shared decision-
making and compassionate presence. The Palliative Care Communication Research Initiative (PCCRI) is a
multi-site cohort study of a diverse population of 240 hospitalized patients with advanced cancer and 54
palliative care clinicians. Participants represent diversity in age, gender, racial and ethnic backgrounds,
religious affiliations, levels of financial insecurity, linguistic repertoire, personality and treatment preferences.
The cohort data include 363 audio-recorded palliative care inpatient consultations comprising more than
10,000 minutes of conversation, 180,000 speaker turns, and 1.4 million words. We have completed the
following Preliminary Studies in preparation for this proposed work: (a) developed a supervised machine
learning algorithm to identify over 28,000 conversational pauses in speaking amid the noisy hospital
environment (e.g., oxygen masks, IV pumps, televisions, hallway voices, etc.),(b) developed a reliable Human
Coding approach for identifying Connectional Silence as a distinct type of conversational pause, and (c)
successfully trained preliminary deep neural networks with both lexical and sound data surrounding pauses in
the PCCRI data. Our team is well positioned to overcome traditional barriers to direct measurement of
communication quality in healthcare settings, advance machine learning technology for analysis of clinical
conversations, and ultimately, improve communication for all seriously ill people. We propose to complete the
following over the two-year award period: Aim One) to train a Deep Neural Network that uses lexical features
of the immediate surrounding conversation to accurately distinguish moments of Connectional Silence from
other types of pauses; Aim Two) Using de-identified spectral images of sound surrounding conversational
pauses, to develop an integrated deep learning algorithm that uses both lexicon and prosody of speech data to
distinguish moments of Connectional Silence from other types of conversational pauses. Exploratory Aim) to
identify the features of communication surrounding Connectional Silence that are associated with patients
feeling more Heard & Understood."

The clinical studies demonstrating that when people maintain undetectable levels of viral loads, HIV cannot
transmit provided an exciting new direction for HIV management. A central part of HIV health care will be to
develop the technology required for home testing of HIV viral loads similar to diabetes management. There are
several requirements for such a home test. First, sample preparation of virus must cleanly isolate virus-laden
plasma without lysing white blood cells or require any lab equipment. Second, the test must store reagents on-
chip at ambient conditions over long periods. Third, the test must provide accurate and ideally, semi-quantitative
information without requiring extensive manipulation, training, or expensive instrumentation. Current diagnostics
cannot meet these requirements. The highest value test is nucleic acid amplification but the enzymes and buffers
require cold chain storage, trained personnel, and frequently, fluorescence-based instrumentation. Antibody-
based tests for viral capture on lateral flow are hampered by lower analytical sensitivity and specificity values,
are not quantitative, and are hampered by protein rather than nucleic acid-based manufacturing infrastructures.
Here we propose the integration of our novel biogel nanosensors and boron-doped diamond microelectrode
arrays to directly provide actionable, semi-quantitative, HIV viral load information for the home user. Our hydrogel
encapsulates and locks in NAAT tests in aqueous environments without oil or manufacturing additional
compartments. The gel provides safe, on-chip storage of reagents and critically, is printable for rapid fabrication
of arrays for digital quantitation. The gel is also specifically positively charged to attract and concentrate viral
genomes from the raw sample which would improve the LOD95. In our proposed platform, a boron-doped
diamond microelectrode underlies each spot in the array. This will provide an individual, electrochemical readout
for every spot which can be interpreted in a digital format for potential quantification. With this platform, the user
simply adds blood from a fingerstick and uses a membrane to separate out the plasma. A second wicking
membrane with lysis reagents delivers viral genomes to the biogel nanosensor array via lateral flow. Together,
the ease of use, on-chip storage, creation of a digital electrochemical readout, and compatibility with
manufacturing infrastructures to keep costs low yields a promising, viable platform for HIV management at home."

Rickettsial diseases caused by pathogens of the Anaplasmataceae family, including members of the genera
Ehrlichia and Anaplasma, have become a growing public health concern over the past three decades and are
a leading cause of tick-borne infections in humans throughout the USA and many parts of the world. The
diseases include the human monocytic and granulocytic ehrlichiosis caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis and
Ehrlichia ewingii respectively, and the human granulocytic anaplasmosis resulting from Anaplasma
phagocytophilum infections. E. canis, first described as a canine pathogen, also causes infections in people.
Recently, another tick-borne pathogen, Ehrlichia muris subsp. eauclairensis, is also reported as causing
disease in people. These pathogens have evolved strategies to evade host immunity and cause persistent
infections. People with persistent infections are difficult to diagnose and pose risk to blood and organ
recipients. Through our recently established mutagenesis experiments, we created E. chaffeensis mutants
that contained insertions causing functional gene disruptions. An insertion mutation in the ECH_0660 gene
resulted in the pathogen's rapid clearance from two vertebrate hosts. Vaccination with this attenuated mutant
induced a strong host response and offered complete against blood stream infection and tick transmission
challenges with wild-type E. cahffeensis. Our further studies suggest that the ECH_0660 homologs are well
conserved among different Ehrlichia/Anaplasma species. Together, our extensive research forms the strong
foundation and premise for the proposed project. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that attenuation
through a functional deficiency in the E. chaffeensis ECH_0660 gene and its homologs in other related
rickettsials will result in safe and efficacious vaccines that are sufficient to prevent wild type infection into the
blood stream or from tick transmission; the two possible means by which tick-borne rickettsials cause
infections in people. We propose the following three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the duration of immunity
offered by the ECH_0660 gene mutant live attenuated vaccine (MLAV) against wild type infection challenge
through blood stream and tick-transmission. 2) Evaluate the protection of the MLAV against genetically distinct
E. chaffeensis strains. 3) Evaluate ECH_0660 gene homolog mutants in related Ehrlichia and Anaplasma
species for their efficacy as live attenuated vaccines in conferring protection against the pathogens' infection
into blood stream and by tick-transmission. The goals represent a logical extension of the substantial progress
we have made from our ongoing research. Further, we have included a rigorous experimental plan to execute
the project goals, which are critical in advancing the development of vaccines to prevent diseases caused by
several important tick-transmitted Ehrlichia and Anaplasma species pathogens. We have the high-level
expertise and the necessary resources to ensure the successful execution of the proposed project goals."

Depression is a fundamentally episodic condition, but the mechanisms mediating mood state transitions are
not well understood. In our prior work, we investigated how stress and antidepressant effects on synaptic
remodeling influence changes in reward-seeking behavior and anhedonia, a core feature of depression. We
found that synaptogenesis in prefrontal cortex (PFC) is required for sustaining antidepressant effects on
behavior but not for initiating them. Here, we will investigate the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level
mechanisms that initiate antidepressant effects on effortful reward-seeking and how they interact with
synaptogenesis to generate durable changes in behavior. PFC circuits support reward-seeking behavior by
mediating effort valuation computations, which integrate information about the magnitude of an anticipated
reward and the expected effort required to obtain it. We have shown how nucleus accumbens (NAc)-projecting
PFC cells encode and integrate information about reward- and effort-predictive cues and are critical for
reinforcing decisions to expend effort to obtain rewards. We will test a model based on extensive preliminary
data in which G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling in somatostatin (SST) interneurons initiates rapid-
acting antidepressant effects on circuit function and behavior. Our efforts will leverage newly developed
photopharmacological tools for manipulating GPCR signaling in specific circuit elements with unprecedented
spatiotemporal precision, in conjunction with state-of-the-art 2P imaging and optogenetic tools for visualizing
and manipulating spine dynamics and circuit function in the living PFC. Our central hypothesis is that Gi/o
activation in SST cells initiates antidepressant effects on effortful reward seeking by disinhibiting PFC-NAc
cells, restoring coordinated activity in PFC circuits and their capacity to encode reward- and effort-related
signals. This, in turn, leads subsequently to the formation of new synapses, which are required for sustaining
antidepressant effects over time. Finally, we will test a strategy for identifying SST-enriched Gi/o-coupled
GPCRs and validating the most promising candidates as novel therapeutic targets, enabling synergistic effects
on effortful reward seeking and anhedonia. Successful completion of our aims will open new avenues for
developing synergistic treatment strategies that converge on disinhibition of PFC projection neurons and
restoration of lost synapses in specific circuits."

Persistent pain secondary to tissue and nerve injury involves key roles for DRG neurons, macrophages, and
spinal microglia. Therapies targeting single components of this tripartite pain axis have not proven clinically
efficacious, suggesting a strategy is needed that addresses all three components in concert. We have exciting
new findings that suggest one such therapeutic strategy may be to target the subset of cellular membrane
cholesterol rich lipid rafts that contain Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4-rafts). Membrane lipid rafts are a fundamental
organizational nidus in all cells for numerous membrane channels, receptors and enzymes that regulate reactivity
and excitability. The TLR4-raft subtype is special as these are specifically localized in the three key cellular
elements regulating the excitability of nociceptive signaling. Following tissue inflammation or nerve injury,
TLR4rafts transform from small diffuse labile membrane structures into markedly enlarged and persistent
complexes supporting the formation of homo and hetero dimers of several excitatory channels and receptors,
underpinning the transition from an acute to a persistent pain phenotype and to establishing a “primed state”
after an initial system activation. Specific disruption of these neuraxial TLR4-rafts has profound effects upon
injury induced pain behavior. While we have gained insight into mechanisms by which TLR4-rafts regulate
microglial function, we know little about the mechanisms by which TLR4-rafts regulate excitability of DRG
neurons and macrophages. To address this knowledge gap, we propose three specific aims: i) Define time
dependent changes in TLR4-rafts and pain behavior induced by trauma, inflammatory and neuropathic pain, and
the effects of targeted TLR4-raft disruption on pain behavior in these models; ii) Determine baseline molecular
architecture of DRG neuronal and macrophage TLR4-rafts and then how this architecture and function is altered
with tissue trauma, inflammation and nerve injury; and iii) Define role of DRG neuronal TLR4-raft localized
receptors in regulating excitatory phenotype in mouse, rat and human DRG neurons and effects of TLR4-raft
disruption in modifying this excitatory phenotype. This is a large multi-PI / multi-center study that defines
mechanisms by which neuraxial TLR4-rafts affect multiple pain-related signaling processes, integrated pain
behavior and the molecular anatomy underpinning this signaling and the degree to which these mechanisms are
conserved between rodents and humans, across differing pain phenotypes. This work will have a sustained
impact on understanding the neurobiology of a largely unexplored cellular element regulating post injury afferent
excitability. In sum, this proposal centers on the unifying thesis that neuraxial TLR4-rafts are a common
facilitatory element of the persistent pain facilitated states observed following tissue and nerve injury and that
this effect is mediated by TLR4 rafts not only on DRG macrophages, and spinal microglia but unexpectedly by
the TLR4-rafts expressed on the DRG nociceptor."

problems. Internalizing disorders (IDs), primarily depression and anxiety, are highly prevalent
among youth receiving community-based treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs), and
unresolved ID issues significantly interfere with SUD treatment and recovery processes. Yet, the
youth SUD clinical workforce is not systematically educated or trained in evidence-based
practices for ID; thus, line services for youth SUD do not systematically target IDs. The research
literature offers a few integrated behavioral models for simultaneously treating both SUDs and
IDs in youth; however, such models feature intensive manualized procedures that have proven
cumbersome to scale and deliver in frontline settings. As a result, the clinical workforce, though
desiring ID-focused training, currently has inadequate resources for treating IDs effectively. A
promising solution to reduce this quality gap is developing a modular, family-based protocol to
augment routine care for comorbid SUD/ID by directly targeting ID as a primary treatment goal:
Family Support Protocol for Adolescent Internalizing Disorders (Fam-AID). Fam-AID will contain
six modules designed to enhance existing SUD services and to be delivered in any sequence to
meet client needs: (1) Family Engagement of caregivers in treatment planning and services; (2)
Relational Reframing of family constraints, resiliencies, and social capital connected to the
youth's ID symptoms; (3) Functional Analysis of the youth's ID symptoms and related behaviors;
(4) Core cognitive-behavioral treatment techniques to address the youth's ID symptoms and
functional needs, featuring transdiagnostic interventions (emotion acceptance, emotional
exposure, behavioral activation) to address negative affect and emotional dysregulation
underlying both depression and anxiety; (5) Family Psychoeducation and Safety Planning
focused on education about comorbid SUD/ID and prevention of youth self-harm.
 The study will follow the NIDA blueprint for Stage 1 development of behavioral protocols. In
the Pilot Stage we will use rapid cycle prototyping methods in collaboration with end-user
stakeholders at two Pilot sites to: (1) Draft protocol delivery and fidelity guidelines adapted from
existing study team resources; (2) Solicit clinic staff and client input on protocol content and
delivery via cognitive interviewing; (3) Pilot the prototype components on 2-3 cases at each site.
We will then conduct an Interrupted Time Series Study for N = 60 comorbid SUD/ID cases
across two sites serving diverse youth: 30 will receive TAU (historical control), and then
following line staff training in the protocol, 30 new cases will receive TAU enhanced by Fam-
AID. Aim 1 will examine Fam-AID cases for protocol acceptability via therapist and client
interviews and fidelity benchmarks via therapist- and observer-report protocol fidelity data. Aim
2 will compare Fam-AID versus TAU for immediate outcomes on family attendance in sessions
and ultimate outcomes on youth ID symptoms at Baseline, 3-, and 6-month follow-up."

Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child
health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the country,
a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years, under
RFA-DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the consortium, and
will track their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health,
and culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual
interviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of
developmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and
parents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through
adolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our
understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping)
interact with each other and with a child’s changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral,
academic, health, and other outcomes.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen
time, sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences influence brain development; (5)
determine and replicate factors that influence mental health from childhood to young adulthood; (6)
characterize relationships between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of substances
such as cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine affects developmental outcomes, and how neural, cognitive,
emotional, and environmental factors influence the risk for adolescent substance use."
10812795,"ABSTRACT
Of the 6,500 known rare diseases, only about 5% have U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments.
In cancer, rare tumors account for approximately 20% of cancer incidence but often lack established therapeutic
regimens. Hence, gaining a molecular understanding of rare tumors is key for development of effective therapies.
This multi-investigator proposal investigates oncogenic mutations that activate protein kinase A (PKA) to promote
defective cell signaling in rare endocrine and hepatic tumors.
Targeted therapeutics have transformed care for patients with rare cancers by targeting oncogenic mutations in
protein kinases. PKAc-driven cancers are challenging to target in this way because this broad specificity kinase
controls myriad physiological processes. Consequently, selective PKAc inhibitors have been relegated to the
role of tool compounds rather than clinically viable drugs. Thus, alternative strategies must be developed to treat
PKAc-driven cancers. Our preliminary profiling of oncogenic PKAc mutants provide compelling evidence that
PKAc engages downstream protein kinase cascades that impact translation in adrenal and hepatic tumors. We
also observed increased mRNA translation as an emerging hallmark of these PKAc driven malignancies. These
findings have forged a working hypothesis that PKAc-driven cancers can be treated by targeting downstream
effectors such the RNA helicase eIF4A rather than globally blocking the catalytic activity of the kinase.
Three specific aims will test this transformative premise. 1) Proteomic and transcriptomic profiling of cells
expressing oncogenic PKAc variants that underlie Carney complex, Cushing’s adenoma and fibrolamellar
carcinoma will elucidate downstream signaling elements that impinge on mRNA translation. 2) Molecular
approaches will investigate new properties imparted by the DNAJ-PKAc-chimeric kinase in fibrolamellar
carcinoma that may confer resistance to chemically induced apoptosis. 3) Clinically relevant compounds and
novel bivalent inhibitors will dissect the mechanism of eIF4A dependence in PKAc-driven malignancies and
patient derived (PDX) models of fibrolamellar carcinoma. This proposal not only builds on a solid foundation of
PKAc research, but also affords an unparalleled opportunity to discover, develop and validate drug targets for a
group of patients in dire need."
10934346,"Most healthy individuals are persistently infected with the human polyomavirus JC (JCPyV) without significant
consequences, yet in immunocompromised hosts, JCPyV can cause an often fatal disease -- progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). There is currently no effective treatment to prevent or treat PML and
novel immune-based therapies are urgently needed to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with
PML. Classically, natural killer (NK) cells are viewed as nonspecific effector cells of the innate immune system
that play critical roles in defense against viral infections. Unexpectedly, it was recently demonstrated that besides
their ability to rapidly eliminate virus-infected cells without the need for prior antigen sensitization, NK cells also
exhibit adaptive immune functions. Different forms of adaptive capabilities have been identified among human
NK cell subpopulations, including reports of true antigen-specific memory NK cells as well as adaptive NK cells
with enhanced antibody-dependent functions. Adaptive NK cell subsets are endowed with potent anti-viral
properties and protection mediated by virus-specific memory NK cells has been demonstrated in mouse models.
Importantly, increasing evidence suggest that NK cell can mediate anti-viral responses to JCPyV. In particular,
our preliminary data now show potent responses to JCPyV peptides by NK cells, isolation and cloning of single
JCPyV-specific NK cells, and reduced JCPyV-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in PML patients.
Based on these data, we hypothesize that NK cells and antibodies eliciting NK cell responses play a role in
JCPyV pathogenesis. Specifically, we propose to build on our preliminary data to investigate the overarching
hypothesis that specific subsets of NK cells can mediate potent anti-viral responses against JCPyV and
protect immunocompromised patients against PML, through two focused independent Aims: (i) Define
mechanisms crucial to control of JCPyV by NK cells; and (ii) Evaluate the role played by JCPyV-specific
antibodies in modulating NK cell activity against JCPyV. If successful, the results of these innovative studies
will contribute new knowledge of human immune response against JCPyV and provide the rationale to develop
novel immunotherapeutic approaches to harness NK cell function against JCPyV."
10825958,"Summary and Relevance of Proposed Research
Humans have a remarkable capacity to learn to recognize the significance of visual stimuli. This ability, which
is disrupted by a brain-based diseases and conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, stroke, and
attention deficit disorder, is critical because it allows us to learn about the meaning of the stimuli that we
encounter, and it enables us to make appropriate decisions. Our recent work examined the roles of a network
of cortical and subcortical areas to visual category decisions, including posterior parietal cortex (PPC), frontal
eye field (FEF), and superior colliculus (SC). However, those previous studies only examined these regions
after weeks or months of training required to learn the categorization tasks. The long training required to learn
those tasks precluded studying mechanisms by which neural category encoding developed during the learning
process itself. This project develops a novel paradigm for studying rapid within-session category learning using
a saccade-based foraging paradigm which takes advantage of subjects’ innate ability to search among arrays
of visual stimuli with saccades. In this paradigm, subjects are presented with arrays of stimuli belonging to two
or three categories, with each category associated with a different reward amount. Subjects must search or
“forage” among stimuli by making self-guided saccades to obtain the reward associated with each target
image. During foraging-based learning, population recordings will monitor PPC, SC, FEF, and orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC). We will also assess the causal contributions of these regions using reversible inactivation during
task performance. This will determine how interactions between neurons in these regions enable rapid
category learning and transforming category recognition into stimulus selection and saccadic motor plans.
While much is known about how the brain processes visual features (such as color, orientation, and direction
of motion), less is known about how the brain learns and represents the meaning, or category, of stimuli. A
greater understanding of visual categorization is critical for addressing a number of brain diseases and
conditions (e.g. stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, and stroke) that leave
patients impaired in everyday tasks that require visual learning, recognition and/or evaluating and responding
appropriately to sensory information. The long-term goal of this project is to guide the next generation of
treatments for these brain-based diseases and disorders by helping to develop a detailed understanding of the
brain mechanisms that underlie learning, memory and recognition. These studies also have relevance for
understanding and addressing learning disabilities, such as attention deficit disorder and dyslexia, which affect
a substantial fraction of school age children and young adults. Thus, a detailed understanding of the basic
brain mechanisms of categorical decisions and attention will likely give important insights into the causes and
potential treatments for disorders involving these cognitive and perceptual abilities."
10785360,"Obesity is a serious health concern in the US and is a significant risk factor for many causes of mortality, including
stroke and cardiovascular disease. Significant evidence points to an important pathogenic link between lymph
barrier dysfunction and obesity. Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are crucial regulators of lymphatic barrier
function. Impaired LEC barrier can cause lymph leakage and lead to adipose tissue accumulation in obesity,
although
few pathways have been identified that regulate the barrier function of lymphatic vessels. Growing
evidence supports a crucial role for LEC Ca2+ signaling pathways in regulating the function of collecting lymphatic
vessels, which collect lymph from peripheral tissues. In this regard, transient receptor potential vanilloid 4
(TRPV4) ion channels serve as a Ca2+ influx pathway in LECs. In preliminary studies, I determine the first
recordings of TRPV4 channel activity in the intact LECs (TRPV4LEC) from mesenteric collecting lymphatic vessels
(MCLVs) of mice. In addition, I show that LEC barrier is disrupted in MCLVs from LEC-specific Trpv4 knockout
(Trpv4LECKO) mice, and Trpv4LECKO mice gain more weight after high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. I also observed that
HFD feeding impairs the activity of LEC TRPV4 (TRPV4LEC) channels in control mice. In addition, my preliminary
studies show that stimulation of mechanosensitive cation channel, Piezo1, increases the activity of TRPV4LEC
channels, supporting a Piezo1LEC–TRPV4LEC signaling axis. Moreover, Piezo1LEC–TRPV4LEC signaling axis is
impaired after HFD feeding, raising the possibility that impaired Piezo1LEC–TRPV4LEC signaling may lead to leaky
MCLVs in obesity. Therefore, I hypothesize that 1) Piezo1LEC–TRPV4LEC signaling regulates body weight;
and 2) disrupted Piezo1LEC–TRPV4LEC signaling impairs LEC barrier function, contributing to weight gain
in obesity.
I will test these hypotheses by executing the following specific aims: In Aim 1, I will determine whether
LEC-specific TRPV4 deletion results in leaky collecting lymph vessels and increased body weight; in Aim 2, I will
determine whether a loss of Piezo1LEC–TRPV4LEC signaling leads to leaky collecting lymph vessels and increased
body weight; in Aim 3, I will determine whether impaired Piezo1LEC–TRPV4LEC signaling contributes to weight
gain in obesemice. The proposed studies will identify a novel LEC Ca2+ signaling mechanism that maintains the
barrier function of collecting lymphatic vessels and regulates body weight.
This application will contribute to Dr. Yen-Lin Chen’s career development as he transitions from a postdoctoral
fellow to an independent researcher. Dr. Sonkusare, a world-renowned physiologist in studying ion channels and
Ca2+ signaling, will support this proposal and mentor Dr. Chen’s scientific and career development, and transition
to independence during this award. To strengthen Dr. Chen’s training, the proposed plan additionally enlists a
mentoring team, including Drs. Scallan, Isakson, and Hirschi. The resourceful and optimal research environment
with the backing of the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) will allow Dr. Chen to develop his own
research niche and transition to be an independent research investigator smoothly and successfully."
10913602,"Project Summary/Abstract
 This proposal focuses on the synergy of experiments and computations in (1) understanding fundamental
reactivity in organic and organometallic transformations and (2) enabling reaction design for the discovery of
methods for enantioselective spirocycle synthesis and radical hydroamination of tri-substituted alkenes. Two
distinct approaches to using aryl and alkyl nitriles for the synthesis of enantioenriched quaternary stereocenters
and nitrogen-containing heterocycles, respectively, are proposed. The medicinal properties of molecules bearing
quaternary centers have drawn particular attention, as a significant positive correlation exists between the
number of stereogenic centers with clinical success. However, the construction of these structural motifs with a
high degree of stereocontrol, especially in the synthesis of spiro centers, remains a significant challenge in
organic synthesis. The goal of the proposed research is to access sterically congested, spirocyclic quaternary
centers in a stereoselective manner by means of nickel-catalyzed acylation reactions of lactones (K99). Reaction
optimization and substrate scope studies will first be performed to establish the desired reactivity with aryl nitriles.
Upon validating the desired reactivity with aryl nitriles experimentally, computations will be performed to
understand the reaction mechanism and help guide substrate scope expansion to alkyl nitriles.
 Secondly, the chemical properties of aryl nitriles will be applied toward the synthesis of nitrogen-containing
heterocycles (R00), which are considered critically important as more than half of the top 20 best-selling small
molecule drugs and nearly 60% of all small molecule drugs possess them. Traditional approaches to C–N bond
formation rely on transition-metal catalyzed transformations, such as Chan-Lam coupling, Buchwald–Hartwig
amination, and Ullmann reaction. Given that most of these metal-catalyzed reactions require the use of high
temperatures and pre-functionalized starting materials, the transition to radical-based C–N bond formation, which
can use mild conditions and simpler starting materials, is highly desirable. My goal is to establish an independent
research program focused on studying boryl radical chemistry for the generation of nitrogen-centered radicals
and regiodivergent hydroamination of trisubstituted alkenes (R00). This project will involve 1) initial computations
on key mechanistic steps to help identify NHC boranes that allow for regioselective formation of azepine and
isoquinoline scaffolds and 2) experimental testing of computational predictions, reaction optimization, and
substrate scope studies. Overall, computational analyses of reaction mechanism and the origins of stereo- or
regioselectivity in the aforementioned transformations will provide a platform to expand the utility of Ni catalysis
for enantioselective synthesis of spirocyclic scaffolds and the application of boryl radical chemistry for C–N bond
formation."

10791918,"Project Summary: Digital Technology Core
Given limitations of conventional clinical assessments to precisely map change trajectories, our research
community increasingly seeks methodologies that incorporate continuous, real-world and objective
measurement of key features (e.g., mobility, cognition, sleep, medication taking, driving) using the pervasive
computing platform and methodologies of ORCATECH (Oregon Center for Aging & Technology). This new
approach has important application in many areas of dementia research beyond early detection, such as
caregiver/care recipient activities; agitation in institutional settings; and objective digital biomarkers (DB) of
sleep, physical activity, and the environment. Use of these technologies is not limited to assessment, but may
also deliver interventions, such as dementia care programs via home video. Given the growing use and
promise of DB and related technologies, this proposal will consolidate and build upon recent advances through
the Oregon Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center’s Digital Technology Core (DTC). Specific Aims are:
 1. To maintain and make available for research, an OADRC dementia-specific focused Life Laboratory
 cohort of research volunteers (healthy controls, MCI, and AD) who will have deployed in their homes

10797282,"Summary. This is a Type 2 R01 renewal application to continue studying Barrett’s esophagus (BE), a premalignant condition
wherein the normal squamous esophageal lining is replaced by a specialized metaplastic columnar epithelium in response
to chronic gastroesophageal reflux (GERD). BE patients carry an increased risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma
(EAC), a rapidly growing, lethal malignancy (5-year survival <20%) whose incidence in the U.S.A. has increased
exponentially over the past four decades.
 The first 5 years of funding by this Academic-Industrial Partnership award have resulted in the creation of a highly
successful new company, Capsulomics (also known as Previse), with the development of a fully licensed commercial
prognostic product to assess future neoplastic progression risk in BE. The current Type 2 renewal proposal will continue
this productive partnership, building on its success while tackling two major clinical dilemmas:
 1) The currently accepted marker for EAC risk in BE patients is histologic dysplasia, either high-grade (HGD) or low-
grade (LGD). In many centers, confirmed HGD is treated in the same manner as early-stage EAC, i.e., by endoscopic
eradication therapy (EET). However, unlike HGD, the predictive value of LGD for cancer risk assessment is weak; moreover,
high inter-observer variation in histologic assessment is problematic. Finally, most BE patients never develop LGD or HGD
and thus have no means of gauging their progression risk. Thus, accurate, objective, quantitative biomarkers of
progression risk in BE will be extremely useful.
 2) Early-stage esophageal neoplasia is highly curable; however, most EACs are detected at advanced, incurable stages.
Furthermore, only 5% of patients presenting with EAC were previously diagnosed with BE, suggesting that failed BE
detection leads to delayed EAC diagnosis. Thus, better early detection of BE and EAC is needed to improve patient
outcome. However, the current means of detection, upper GI endoscopy (EGD), is too expensive, invasive, and inaccessible
to be practical for population-based screening. Thus, nonendoscopic early BE and EAC detection strategies are needed.
 We will tackle these challenges by pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1. Analytically and clinically validate and
commercialize the EsoPredict methylation assay for personalized BE risk assessment; 1A: Perform an expanded analytical
and multicenter clinical validation study of the prognostic assay EsoPredict on FFPE tissue-derived DNAs from 400 patients,
incorporating multivariate analyses; 1B: Develop and implement pathways to introduce and establish EsoPredict into
clinical practice; 2. Develop, validate, and begin commercialization of the EsoDetect diagnostic assay for nonendoscopic
BE diagnosis, using a swallowable-retrievable sponge sampling device; 2A. Build and test a multivariate algorithm on
sponge-derived DNAs from 600 patients with various stages of BE neoplasia, incorporating multivariate analyses; 2B.
Initiate commercialization of the sponge sample-based EsoDetect assay; and 3. Conduct a prospective study of EsoPredict
in tissues and non-endoscopic sponge samples from 350 BE patients, including 260 carried forward from Aim 2."

10820570,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (and related dementias ADRDs) are the leading cause of dementia in those over the age
of 65. Attempts to develop therapeutics to treat the condition have, to date, yielded disappointing results in
clinical trials. Neuropathologies associated with the disease include increased levels of proteotoxic species of
both beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau. Aβ and tau have both independently been hypothesized to be the primary
agent driving ADRD-related neurodegeneration, although it is not clear that these “proteinopathies” are the
cause of these disorders. Neurotoxic proteins are certainly associated with intracellular and extracellular
protein aggregates in the form of tangles and plaques. These pathological features contain other insoluble,
aggregated cellular proteins. We and others have shown that increased protein insolubility is a feature of
normal aging. The proteins that enter the “insolublome” are enriched for lifespan determining functions, but it is
not clear how normal aging processes and the ADRD disease processes are related. “Geroscience” is a
concept that unites research on normal aging processes and research on chronic progressive diseases such
as AD. Integral to the Geroscience approach is that aging is a likely cause of multiple human chronic diseases.
It follows that interventions that target aging will provide novel therapeutic avenues for distinct diseases
including ADRDs. We have previously identified scores of chemical compounds that extend the lifespan of the
nematode C. elegans and have preliminary data that some of these compounds promote general protein
homeostasis and suppress aspects of neurological disease. Here we propose to exploit this resource to better
understand the relationship between normal aging and ADRDs but also to develop new potential therapies. We
propose to initially test the efficacy of aging interventions in C. elegans models of Aβ and tau neurotoxicity and
in human cell-based models of ADRDs. We will then screen for effects on age-related protein insolubility in
these models. We will use the powerful genetics of the worm and biochemical techniques to determine
pathways and mechanisms in a subset of lead compounds. Finally, we will utilize mouse models of ADRDs, to
gauge the effectiveness of aging intervention in the top 1-2 lead compounds. By undertaking such a
“Geroscience approach”, we aim to develop new methods to targeting the very earliest proteostatic changes
that lead to AD."

This proposal requests support for partial funding of the 2024 “Barriers of the Central Nervous System (CNS)”
GRC and GRS that will be held at Colby Sawyer College, New Hampshire, on June 8-9, 2024 (GRS) and June
9-14, 2024 (GRC). The overall goal of this international conference is to improve understanding of the highly
complex cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating the function of the endothelial (e.g., blood-brain barrier
(BBB)/blood-retina barrier (BRB) or neurovascular unit (NVU)), epithelial (e.g., blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB) and
arachnoid), and other neural barriers in health and disease. The 2024 meetings will achieve this goal by covering
major aspects of CNS barrier sciences and by making a special translational effort to include novel methods of
gene therapy, drug delivery to the CNS, delivery of macromolecules (such as antibodies and siRNA), and
organoid based approaches to understanding barriers of the CNS. Moreover, we have a dedicated session on
in vitro models and trafficking at the BBB and how these may be employed to examine drug delivery and BBB
(NVU) development and regulation. Additionally, our session on genetic diseases and gene therapies will seek
to explore how the power of molecular genetics can drive the development of the next generation of drugs for
CNS diseases. This interdisciplinary, highly translational knowledge exchange will be fostered by invited talks,
talks selected from abstracts, daily poster presentations and ample time for non-structured scientific discussions
amongst participants. The program will start with a keynote session addressing the role of the blood retina barrier
(BRB) in regulating disease severity for conditions such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and age-related macular
degeneration (AMD). We will also have a keynote address focusing on brain barriers in drug delivery and novel
approaches to overcome the barrier to treat neural malignancies such as high-grade gliomas. The conference
will conclude with a trendsetting keynote session focused on regulating the BBB to treat diseases. This is a fast
developing area and seeks to develop methods aimed at stabilising BBB integrity to treat disease. An additional
7 sessions will address: i) Genetic diseases and gene therapies targeting BBB biology, ii) In vitro models and
trafficking at the BBB, iii) Drug delivery to the CNS, iv) Understudied cell types and novel barriers of the CNS,
v) BBB regulation in neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases, vi) Neuroinflammation and neuroinfections in
BBB regulation, and vii) Dynamic flow and novel concepts in the CNS barriers. The inclusion of clinicians in the
meeting is a critical part of fostering translational discussion and establishing new collaborations between basic
and clinical scientists in this field. Additionally, we have sought to strike a balance between academic and
industry associated speakers as we believe that fostering cohesion between these groups will push the
translational focus of the meeting. This application addresses a major public health concern; diseases of the
CNS. Instructing young researchers to think of innovative and novel solutions, and to bridge disciplinary
interfaces in established laboratories will advance the capacity to develop new therapies for CNS diseases."

Durable tumor regression by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has been observed in a small cohort of cancer
patients, but ICB efficacy varies widely on an individual basis. ICB largely targets cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, but the
mechanisms regulating CD8+ T cell responses to ICB are yet to be elucidated. CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells remain
highly cytotoxic and proliferative within the tumor microenvironment and single-cell RNA-sequencing of
CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells from ICB responders exhibited a consistent decrease in expression of Dual Specificity
Phosphatase 2 (DUSP2), a nuclear phosphatase, compared to CX3CR1- CD8+ T cells. Peripheral human CD8+
T cells with DUPS2 knockdown (KD) increased tumor cytotoxicity in vitro, whereas overexpression (OE) trended
towards decreased secretion of effector molecules, Granzyme B and Interferon gamma. Recent reports have
additionally documented increased in vivo anti-tumor capacity in DUSP2 KO mice and have loosely made a
connection between DUSP2 and CX3CR1 expression6, but the role of DUSP2 in CD8+ T cells and in ICB
responses specifically, is a context not yet explored. Furthermore, the signaling pathways in human primary cells
have yet to be revealed. Our preliminary data initiated a goal to uncover DUSP2’s mechanistic role in ICB
response in hopes of pinpointing therapeutic targets that may improve ICB response rates. This proposal will
investigate the hypothesis that DUSP2 expression in CD8+ T cells negatively regulates effector function
in response to ICB. The proposed specific aims of this proposal are to 1) characterize the impact of DUSP2
expression in CD8+ T cells on ICB response and 2) determine the regulatory mechanisms of DUSP2
transcription in CD8+ T cells and the downstream pathways modulated by DUSP2. To determine the impact of
DUSP2 on ICB response, tumor size and kinetics, as well as CD8+ T cell phenotype will be analyzed in CD8+ T
cell Dusp2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice receiving tumor and ICB injection. The DUSP2 signaling network
will be uncovered by promoter pull-down assay, single-cell profiling, and RNA-sequencing analyses of human
CD8+ T cells with DUSP2 KD or OE. Identified pathways will be modulated (blocked or activated) in human
CD8+ T cells by in vitro administration of pathway inhibitors and agonists. DUSP2 expression will be
subsequently measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR, western blot, and flow cytometry and CD8+
T cells will be phenotyped by flow cytometry and included in tumor co-culture cytotoxicity assays. The proposed
in vivo experiments will expose DUSP2’s role in regulating ICB response. Uncovering the DUSP2 interactome
in human CD8+ T cells can provide a novel and translationally significant opportunity to improve ICB
response in oncology patients with limited therapeutic alternatives."

interdisciplinary experts in kidney function equations (Dr. Susan Furth, MD, PhD), qualitative research (Dr.
Elisa Gordon, PhD, MPH), consensus-building and implementation in surgery (Dr. Mehul Raval, MD, MS), and
advanced implementation science methodology (Dr. Justin Smith, PhD). Dr. Chu’s career development plan
will be supported by the exceptional institutional environment of Lurie Children’s Hospital and Northwestern
University, including the 1) Dedicated resources and research infrastructure within Lurie Children’s Hospital’s
Division of Urology and Department of Surgery; 2) Robust, high-volume, and multi-disciplinary Lurie Children’s
Hospital Spina Bifida Clinic; and 3) Strong research support from Northwestern University’s Clinical and
Translation Sciences Institute and the Institute for Public Health and Medicine. The overall objective of this
scientific proposal is to improve kidney health assessment tools and approaches in young patients with spina
bifida. Various guidelines prioritize preserving kidney health in these patients, but preliminary evidence
suggests that current tools and approaches for assessing kidney health are inaccurate, not patient-centered,
and not uniformly implemented by providers. The Aims of this proposal are to: 1) Compare current kidney
function estimating equations to gold-standard iohexol plasma clearance tests and develop novel, spina-bifida-
specific equations; 2) Assess patient knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs towards kidney health and evaluation,
guided by the revised Health Belief Model; and 3) Assess provider preferences, barriers, and facilitators
towards kidney health surveillance methods and strategies to create consensus implementation practices. The
combination of advanced quantitative, qualitative, and implementation research methods and mentored
training will ensure Dr. Chu emerges as a highly successful, independent investigator in spina bifida care."

10818163,"Project Summary
Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) are major human pathogens, which have a propensity to develop antimicrobial
resistance (AMR). Bloodstream (BSIs) and other serious KP infections are usually caused by strains that
colonize the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Emerging whole genome sequence (WGS) data show that the GI tract is
colonized by clonal bacterial populations, in which genetic diversity develops. It is unknown how often BSIs are
caused by clonal but genetically diverse strains of a given bacterium, since clinical labs generally characterize a
single colony from positive cultures. In preliminary studies, we performed WGSing on strains isolated from 10
independent colonies from carbapenem-resistant KP (CRKP)-positive blood cultures of 6 patients. In all patients,
blood cultures contained genetically distinct sequence type-258 CRKP strains, as evident by core genome single
nucleotide polymorphisms, gene deletions and other mutations, and plasmid or plasmid-borne gene loss.
Genetically distinct CRKP strains exhibited significant differences in antibiotic tolerance and AMR, capsular
polysaccharide content, and other virulence-associated phenotypes. Genetic variant strains from 2 patients
displayed significant differences in virulence during BSIs of mice. It is unclear whether our results were unique
to CRKP BSIs, which typically occur in patients who face significant selection pressures from long-term antibiotic
use and other stressors, or if the findings carry clinical significance. We hypothesize that: 1) baseline BCs from
patients diagnosed with antibiotic susceptible (S)-KP BSIs contain genotypically and phenotypically diverse
strains that are not identified by the clinical microbiology lab; 2) antibiotic treatment failures are associated with
emergence of KP strains with pre-existing antibiotic tolerance, AMR or virulence attributes; and 3) specific gene
variants in KP strains associated with treatment failure contribute to antibiotic tolerance, AMR, and/or virulence.
In aim 1, we will perform WGSing and phenotypic assays on 10 strains from positive baseline BCs from each of
10 patients with S-KP BSIs who were treated successfully with antibiotics, and from 10 patients who failed
treatment. We will determine diversity within each patient, and compare baseline diversity in patients who
responded to antibiotics and in those who failed. In aim 2, we will perform WGSing and phenotypic assays on
10 KP strains from antibiotic treatment failure blood cultures in each of the 10 patients from aim 1. We will
compare diversity at time of treatment failure with that at baseline. We will also validate certain genes and
mutations associated with strains from treatment failures for contributions to antibiotic responses and virulence.
Demonstrating within-host genotypic and phenotypic diversity of KP strains in this study would suggest that this
phenomenon is not limited to the most highly resistant BSIs, but rather a more generalized phenomenon. Finding
unrecognized antibiotic tolerance, AMR or virulence among KP in patients who fail treatment would indicate that
diversity is clinically relevant. Our project has the potential to impact medical and clinical lab practices, and to
afford new insights into determinants and mechanisms of KP antibiotic responses and pathogenesis."

Approximately 600,000 people live with partial hand limb loss (PHLL) in the United States, with an estimated
14,500 new cases occurring each year. Despite the advances in miniaturized electronics and motors, there has
been very little advancement in mechatronic prosthetic digits for this underserved patient population. In fact, to
date, there is only one myoelectric prosthetic option for individuals with PHLL in the US. This option is fragile,
often limited to light-duty tasks, and is too large to use on most partial hand loss cases. Considering this, it is no
surprise that less than half of the individuals with partial hand absence are able to return to their previous
employment, and those who do must often make considerable changes to their work-related tasks.
Thus, there is a substantial need to deliver a robust, low-profile myoelectric prosthetic digit system. To address
this need, we have formed a collaborative development team that has successfully launched eleven devices,
which have been fit on over 5,500 patients with upper limb loss and has significant regulatory experience, having
received two 510(k) approvals and nine CE marks for upper limb prosthetic devices.
Our funded Phase I project was focused on engineering development of a frame, transmission, and motor driver.
All eight Phase I milestones were successfully met, and we went further to complete a User Needs Analysis.
Based on these results, we now propose a Phase II effort focused on two highly focused engineering aims: 1)
To develop, implement and optimize a novel clutch design; and 2) To develop, implement, and optimize a
modular power system for partial hand myoelectric prostheses. Aim #1 is important since it will enable the finger
to tolerate a 10-fold increase in passive load transmission versus during active use. Aim #2 is important because
no currently existing power system meets the requirements determined by the User Needs Analysis, including:
1) low profile design; 2) allows users to replace the battery units themselves; and 3) compatible with single-
handed use.
The mission of Point Designs is to help individuals with PHLL regain the abilities that they had previously lost.
We develop products that provide prosthetists and patients with solutions to meet the unique needs of each
patient in this dynamic and challenging healthcare setting. To date, Point Designs has served over 1,100
individuals with partial hand limb loss (and our collaborative group has served an even greater number as noted
previously). The work proposed in this proposal is critical to our efforts to develop a myoelectric partial hand
prosthesis called Point Powered. We believe that this technology will provide an effective and durable solution
for many people with finger loss and ensure their ability to enjoy their work, family, and life to the fullest."
11166802,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
There are more than 230,000 new cases of lung cancer and over 130,000 deaths due to lung cancer each year
in the U.S. Approximately 120,000 people each year will present with metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
(mNSCLC) for the first time, and only 7% of these patients will survive five years or more.
accurius is developing the first of a kind inhalable agent that will be a safe and highly effective treatment for
mNSCLC and other cancers metastatic to the lung. The agent is an engineered oncolytic virus based on the
Influenza A virus (eIAV) which will selectively infect and destroy cancer cells while sparing healthy cells and
induce the body’s own anti-tumor immune response. This treatment will dramatically improve overall survival
rates for the metastatic NSCLC patient population as well for the 50,000 patients each year with different tumor
types that have their cancer metastasize to the lung.
Phase I of the accurius project will determine the top two eIAV candidates in the accurius pipeline, each of
which must improve median survival time by more than 50% versus the control arm in animal models while
showing significant ability to elicit the natural immune response to the presence of the tumors. Follow-up
testing will determine if either or both of the candidates can improve median survival time by an additional 25%
in combination with an immune checkpoint blocker.
Phase II will finalize the cell culture-based manufacturing process for the candidate(s) which passed both tests
in phase I and also optimize their inhalable form. The inhalable forms will then have to pass the same efficacy
and natural immune response stimulation tests as in Phase I as well as demonstrating safety in animal models
without tumors in order to proceed to further clinical testing in humans.
The potential realizable market for accurius’s safe, inhalable, effective eIAV is over 100,000 metastatic lung
cancer patients annually in the US alone, the vast majority of whom will not respond to currently available
treatments and face dismal survival prospects."
10822088,"SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a lethal tumor type characterized by exquisite response to chemotherapy
followed by rapid emergence of chemoresistance. Addition of PDL-1 inhibition to platinum/etoposide
chemotherapy leads to improved clinical responses but only a small subset of SCLC patients benefit. Distinct
subsets of SCLC have been identified including high-neuroendocrine and low-neuroendocrine (NE) subtypes.
High-NE SCLC, expressing high levels of ASCL1 (SCLC-A) or NEUROD1 (SCLC-N) is best understood, with
genetically engineered mouse models available. However, our understanding of low-NE subtypes is poor, owing
in part to a lack of mouse models. A low-NE immune “inflamed” subset of SCLC (SCLC-I) exhibited increased
response to immune checkpoint blockade and high expression of RE-1 Silencing Element (REST), a suppressor
of neuronal and neuroendocrine gene expression. Aim 1 tests hypotheses that REST overexpression in a
mouse model of SCLC will result in low-NE SCLC and that REST increases immunogenicity. We will use gain
and loss of function studies to dissect the contribution of REST to SCLC and to model low-NE SCLC. RNA-seq
analyses will use data from mouse GEM models and isogenic cell lines with REST perturbation to identify genes
consistently regulated by REST while CUT&RUN will identify direct targets of REST. We will perform gain and
loss of function studies to assess pathways through which REST alters the biology of SCLC, with an initial focus
on how REST controls the expression of MHC-I. Aim 2 builds from our preliminary data that implicate REST
expression in driving chemotherapy resistance. We performed an in vivo functional CRISPR activation
(CRISPRa) screen to identify genes that switch chemosensitive patient derived xenograft (PDX) models to
become chemoresistant when overexpressed and among the top screen hits was REST. We will study the
impact of REST perturbation on chemotherapy response and will test our hypothesis that REST expression will
cause a switch to chemoresistance. We will perform immunohistochemistry and molecular analyses to
characterize the response of REST-perturbed PDX models to chemotherapy in vivo. With the increased
appreciation of low-NE SCLC but poor understanding of the underlying biology, it is critical that this important
subset of SCLC be modelled and understood. This proposal provides new in vivo GEM and PDX models of low-
NE SCLC, which are essential reagents to link biologically distinct SCLC subsets to the most promising
therapeutic approaches."
10822418,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has dramatically altered the cancer therapy landscape, the
susceptibility of CAR T cells to succumb to exhaustion in response to chronic stimulation by tumor antigen
remains a major challenge. Strategies to overcome CAR T cell exhaustion are critically needed and represent a
key research priority. Epigenetic gene activating programs have emerged as important facilitators of CAR T
exhaustion, as demonstrated by the observation that CAR T cells lacking the DNA-modifying enzyme TET2
persist in the face of chronic antigen stimulation and the previous knowledge that TET2 reverses the gene
silencing program induced by DNA methylation. Taken together, these insights suggest that activation of specific
genes may be sufficient and necessary to promote exhaustion. This proposal aims to identify such genes, which
represent attractive targets for inhibition to generate more durable CAR T cells. Aim 1 focuses on creating the
first split-engineered CRISPR/dCas9-guided epigenome editors. These TET-based technologies (seEE)
inducibly activate under the control of a small molecule, enabling controllable activation of target genes in a
manner that recapitulates the dynamic, inducible nature of epigenetic reprogramming. Aim 2 seeks to
identify TET-regulated genes implicated in CAR T cell exhaustion, first by employing a novel inducible TET
overexpression construct (seTET) to decipher the dynamic epigenetic landscape of chronically stimulated
CAR T cells, and then by leveraging the unique properties of seEE to screen for genes involved in inducing
CAR T cell exhaustion. Candidate genes will be targeted for reactivation and the resulting impact on CAR T
cell phenotype will be evaluated, revealing actionable targets for inhibition as a strategy to improve the
therapeutic efficacy of CAR T cells. The proposed research will result in the introduction of novel epigenome
editing technologies and provide key insights into the epigenetics of CAR T cell exhaustion with high translational
potential. Importantly, this research will also train an MD/PhD student to become a well-rounded, independent
physician-scientist. In conjunction with clinical immersion activities within the Perelman School of Medicine’s
Medical Scientist Training Program, opportunities for collaboration and scientific communication both inside and
outside of Penn, and specialty-specific career development activities, the research performed under this funding
opportunity will prepare the student for a successful career as a physician-scientist focused on the extension of
cell-based immunotherapies and epigenetic prognostication strategies for various diseases of the
gastrointestinal tract."

Metabolomics technique holds promise for better understanding the role of diet in cardiovascular disease (CVD)
epidemiology and prevention. In particular, a multi-fluid multi-metabolite approach combining urinary and
plasma metabolomics will likely enhance the accuracy and precision of nutritional biomarkers, with strong
potential to develop novel tools for dietary assessment in precision nutrition research. This competing renewal
is aimed to examine the effects of the randomized Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) interventions on urinary
metabolite levels and to assess dietary biomarkers' predictive ability for future CVD risk in the landmark
PREDIMED trial. We will assess urinary metabolomics in relation to CVD through a case-cohort design,
including a representative subcohort randomly sampled from all PREDIMED participants (10%, n=779), and
incident CVD cases (including myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular deaths)
through December 2017 (n=529). The proposed Specific Aims are: (1) To identify specific urinary metabolites
and multi-metabolite signatures of the MedDiet pattern and its main food components; (2) To examine the
effects of the randomized dietary interventions on changes in the urinary multi-metabolite signatures of the
MedDiet pattern and its major food components from baseline to year 1 (post intervention); (3) To investigate
whether baseline and 1-year changes in urinary multi-metabolite signatures of the MedDiet pattern and of
individual foods are associated with subsequent risk of CVD; and (4) To develop a multi-fluid (urine and
plasma) multi-metabolite signature that robustly predicts risk of CVD and assess whether 1-year changes in
the signature mediate the effects of the dietary interventions on the composite CVD outcome. As a sub-aim, we
will compare the predictive roles of plasma and urinary metabolites of the MedDiet pattern on CVD risk. This
ongoing grant started in 2013 and was renewed in 2017. To date, 36 papers have been published or
submitted (including 20 papers in the current grant cycle). The PREDIMED metabolomics data have been
used as a resource for replicating metabolomics analyses of CVD outcomes in several US cohorts. This
competing renewal application will extend our long-standing research on MedDiet and CVD to multi-fluid multi-
metabolite profiling in a large randomized intervention trial. This project leverages numerous strengths of the
PREDIMED trial, a multi-disciplinary and highly productive team, cutting-edge metabolomics technologies, and
high-dimensional data analytics. The identified dietary biomarkers will enhance the quality and rigor of
nutrition research and strengthen the evidence base for developing dietary recommendations and nutrition
policies. The proposed work will facilitate the precision nutrition research agenda outlined in the 2020-2030
Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research."
10822733,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Preeclampsia (PE), a pregnancy-specific condition characterized by hypertension and other organ system
dysfunction, is a major contributor to worldwide morbidity and mortality for both the mother and offspring.
During PE, pregnant individuals may experience life-threatening complications and they harbor lifelong risks for
cardiovascular disease, while the offspring may experience complications related to prematurity. High-quality
evidence supports the use of low-dose aspirin to reduce the risk of PE in those at high-risk, and emerging data
suggests that tighter blood pressure control may also mitigate the risks. Identification of pregnancies at
high-risk, however, currently relies on crude assessment of clinical risk factors alone with poor positive
predictive values. Although screening programs outside of the United States (US) report high detection rates,
many include maternal clinical factors, serum biomarkers, and ultrasound measures. Testing of performance in
a US population has not been possible as these included metrics are not routinely measured as part of
standard prenatal care. Although PE is rooted in placental dysfunction, with aberrations, such as epigenetic
modifications, occurring early in pregnancy, the placenta remains inaccessible during pregnancy. Recent data
suggests that placental derivatives (RNA, cell-free DNA) circulating in maternal circulation can be interrogated
to understand developing pregnancy complications, including PE. Our key insight is that the sequencing data
generated via cell-free DNA based non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for aneuploidy screening can be
leveraged to infer epigenetic signatures specific to the placenta. With testing of over 1000 samples, we have
found that epigenetic signatures (in this case, nucleosome positioning) can be reliably inferred based on
available sequencing data, and that machine learning modeling can be used to predict early-onset PE. In the
proposed studies, Kanona, Inc and collaborators will build upon this work to refine/correct technical and
analytic variables, perform validation on a separate and distinct cohort, and optimize the methodology for PE
risk classification from cfDNA through sequencing of placental samples and deeper sequencing of first
trimester cfDNA samples. With the studies proposed here, and follow-up phase II external validation studies,
Kanona, Inc. will develop a test for PE prediction that can be easily performed in conjunction with cell-free DNA
based NIPT without the need for additional blood samples or dedicated laboratory workflows. This has the
potential to significantly alter the landscape of prenatal care, providing an element of precision medicine with
potentially actionable information that can prompt initiation of interventions or tailored monitoring programs to
ultimately decrease the incidence and potentially severity of PE."
10822142,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis and affects millions of people in the United States. No
disease-modifying drugs exist. Hence, treatment is currently limited to pain management, exercise and weight loss, or
ultimately total joint replacement. Approaches which can identify early signs of OA and OA progression are critically
needed for drug development. To better understand OA and to help identify genes associated with OA which might be
targetable for drug development, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted. As GWAS typically
require large sample sizes, meta-analyses have commonly been used to combine data from OA-specific and large-scale
population studies reaching close to a million samples.
However, endpoints for such studies are generally defined by radiographic diagnosis of OA, total joint replacement, ICD
codes, or self-reported OA. Hence, complicating the differentiation of genetic associations with early signs of OA
progression from genetic associations with later OA disease stages. Several studies indicate the utility of image
biomarkers for GWAS; but these imaging genetics (IG) studies only use relatively simple image biomarkers (such as bone
shape, bone area, alpha angle, or minimum joint space width). On the other hand, deep learning approaches (DL), which
can use image information in a more comprehensive way, have been successfully applied to segment cartilage and bone
from images at scale and have shown promise for disease prediction. Hence, this project will develop advanced image
biomarkers and related statistical approaches to improve OA GWAS results and to identify druggable genes associated
with early OA disease stages. By learning image biomarkers from longitudinal data we will directly link biomarkers to
progression.
Unfortunately, while OA image datasets amenable to IG exist, those are typically either relatively small, not OA-specific,
or provide heterogenous imaging modalities and acquisitions. This project will therefore develop computational
approaches which can take advantage of such heterogeneous datasets. We will base our analyses on the Osteoarthritis
Initiative, Johnston County, and UK Biobank datasets resulting in over 100,000 patients. We will focus on knee OA for
which no IG studies exist and will extract image biomarkers from DXAs, radiographs, and 3D MRIs, including from
longitudinal data to develop progression-sensitive biomarkers. Our resulting image analysis and statistical approaches will
be general and therefore applicable beyond knee OA.
To assure reproducible results we will provide all our analysis approaches in open-source form. They will be easy to use
and will simultaneously be targeted at users wishing to build upon our approaches as well as users who want to use them
for their own analyses. We will provide zero-install web-based data exploration capabilities to simplify analyses and
quality control. Our analysis approaches will be developed based on industry-strength software engineering, will
dramatically improve OA IG analysis capabilities, will benefit the entire research community, and will effectively
democratize OA analyses."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD), the graduate loss of kidney function, is an incurable condition which affects more
than 37 million individuals in the United States and is costly to manage. In particular, Black Americans face a
higher risk to develop CKD and progress to end stage kidney disease (ESKD) even after accounting for clinical
and socioeconomic factors. Recently, variants in the gene encoding for Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) have been
identified as risk factors for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and HIV-associated nephropathy
(HIVAN) in individuals with recent African ancestry. However, the cell-specific mechanisms that cause disease
are not well understood. In this study we propose to better understand the effect of risk variant APOL1 on
macrophage function and inflammation. Specifically, we hypothesize that risk variant APOL1 hinders the
macrophage's ability to polarize toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype and thus prolongs inflammation in the
kidney after injury. Because APOL1 is found only in humans and new-world primates, we will use induced
pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived macrophages to more accurately model native genomic regulation of
APOL1. To recapitulate the kidney microenvironment and its effects on macrophage activation, we will induce
inflammatory kidney injury in transgenic mice expressing the APOL1 variants. In both iPSC-derived
macrophages and transgenic mouse kidney macrophages we will observe the effects of risk variant APOL1 on
inflammatory signaling, metabolic activity, and mitochondria-mediated autophagy. We will also evaluate the
effect of risk variant APOL1 on anti-inflammatory polarization in macrophages. The goal of this study is to unveil
the mechanisms in risk variant APOL1 macrophages which contribute to kidney disease progression."
10820998,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Dendritic cells (DCs) are sentinels of the immune system that operate at interface of the innate and
adaptive immune response. DC-driven responses require their migration from peripheral tissue to the draining
lymph node in order prime naïve T cells. Understanding and discovering novel targets that can manipulate DC
localization will be beneficial for developing new therapeutic interventions, particularly in the context of
vaccination where DC-driven responses are critical for initiation of memory T cell responses.
 Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and CD80 are cell-surface protein ligands that belong to the B7
family of proteins and possess the ability to bind to the CD28 family of receptors on T cells in order to provide
coinhibitory or costimulatory signals. In addition to their roles in cell-cell communication between DCs and T
cells, how PD-L1 and CD80 regulate intracellular signals within migratory DCs remains understudied. Recent
published work from the laboratory of my mentor, Dr. Beth Tamburini, demonstrated that PD-L1 intracellular
signaling plays an important role in regulating DC migration by controlling chemokine receptor signaling in the
context of a type I immune response. My preliminary data suggest that blocking extracellular interactions of PD-
L1 with CD80, but not PD-1, decreases DC migration during an inflammatory response within the skin.
Additionally, I also found that increased amounts of pathogen-specific tissue resident memory T cells (TRM)
persist in the skin after resolution of vaccinia infection in mice with impaired PD-L1 intracellular signaling within
cross-presenting DCs. With these preliminary findings in mind, we hypothesize that PD-L1 cis interactions with
CD80 regulate intracellular signaling cascades needed to promote migration of DCs. We also hypothesize that
while PD-L1-mediated DC retention during cutaneous infection leads to enhanced formation of TRM cells,
persistent antigen presentation leads to T cell exhaustion and impaired cell-mediated immunity upon
rechallenge. Our aims are as follows: 1. Define which extracellular interactions between PD-L1 and CD80
regulate DC migration and 2. Determine how PDL1 intracellular signals facilitate memory T cell phenotype and
function during a viral infection. These studies present an opportunity to investigate the mechanism by which
PD-L1 governs migration of cDCs and characterize how retention of migratory DCs in the skin can alter T cell
responsiveness to viral antigen. These findings are especially significant in the context of PD-L1 immunotherapy,
currently used in the clinic, which prohibits both cis and trans PD-L1 interactions. Loss of these interactions by
PD-L1 binding partners could explain resulting off-target effects within nonlymphoid organs such the skin in
patients on PD-L1 immunotherapy."
10821004,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Allergen-induced asthma is a chronic disease predominantly characterized by dysregulated type 2
inflammation in the lung. While the adaptive immune system has been implicated in asthma pathogenesis for
many years, research over the last decade has recognized that Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are
potent drivers of type 2 inflammation in the lung and major contributors to allergen-exacerbated asthma. ILC2
are similar in function to Th2-polarized CD4+ helper T cells in that they produce Type 2 cytokines like IL-5 and
IL-13, but they lack rearranged antigen receptors and are instead activated predominantly by alarmin
cytokines. While their pro-inflammatory potential and connection to asthma has been established, the precise
mechanisms by which these cells are activated and proliferate in response to aeroallergens are ill defined. I
have utilized the Collaborative Cross recombinant inbred mouse panel to map a quantitative trait locus (QTL)
that associates with the number of lung ILC2, a function of activation and proliferation, in response to airway
challenge with extract from the common environmental allergen Alternaria alternata (Alt Ex). The Collaborative
Cross (CC) is an ambitious, multi-center mouse genetics project created to allow for the investigation of
complex polygenic traits. The panel boasts over 50 recombinant inbred lines created from 8 founder strains (5
lab-derived, 3 wild-caught) that encompass >90% of the known genetic diversity in the Mus musculus species.
I enumerated ILC2 after Alt Ex challenge in 45 unique founder and recombinant CC strains, and I successfully
mapped a novel 0.343 megabase QTL associated with ILC2 number in the lung containing 72 protein coding
genes. The goal of this proposal is to identify and define the precise function of the causative gene or genes
within this QTL that contribute to ILC2 proliferation in response to aeroallergen challenge. I identified CD22, a
Siglec family receptor that inhibits B cell proliferation, as the most biologically plausible of the 72 gene
candidates. I hypothesize that CD22 is the causative gene driving the observed phenotypic differences among
the CC lines and that CD22 signaling in ILC2 inhibits their activation and proliferation. I confirmed that CD22 is
expressed on ILC2, and I observed differences in CD22 expression between CC strains that had high and low
ILC2 number in response to Alt Ex challenge. I will further test this hypothesis with two specific aims. In Aim 1,
I will perform experiments in our Alt Ex challenge model using CD22 knockout mice to investigate the effect of
gene deletion on ILC2 proliferation in vivo. Further, I will utilize a CD22-blocking antibody to define the effect of
receptor blockade on ILC2 proliferation. In Aim 2, I will continue to reduce the interval of my QTL to narrow the
list of gene candidates through the phenotyping of additional mice. I will acquire Diversity Outbred (DO) mice
and utilize my Alt Ex challenge model, increasing my fine mapping power and further defining my genes of
interest. In completing these studies, I will characterize a previously unknown regulator of allergen-induced
ILC2 number in the lung and potential therapeutic target in the treatment of allergen-exacerbated asthma."

Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus of the Togaviridae family that causes fever, rash, and arthralgia
in humans, leading to debilitating illness and poor quality of life. In the past 20 years, CHIKV has greatly
expanded its geographic distribution in part due to climate changes as well as its adaptation to Aedes
albopictus mosquitoes and remains a global health threat due to its high rate of infectivity and the severity of
disease it causes. Estimates indicate that over 1.3 billion people reside in areas at risk for CHIKV
transmission, with over 114,181 cases and 43 deaths reported to date in 2023 alone. Despite CHIKV’s
classification as a category C priority pathogen and its recent identification as a prototype pathogen for NIAID’s
Plan for Pandemic Preparedness, there are currently no licensed vaccines or therapeutics to protect against
CHIKV infection. While a few vaccine candidates have progressed to advanced stages of development,
manufacturing challenges exist for complex vaccine compositions for enveloped viruses. This is compounded
by an incomplete understanding of virally-induced chronic CHIKV disease mechanisms that can introduce
adverse event risks, especially for replication-competent vaccines. Alternate vaccines utilizing methods that
can offer better safety profiles as well as benefits in manufacturing are warranted. We have developed a
promising recombinant subunit CHIKV vaccine that induces high levels of neutralizing antibodies, prevents
viral replication in immunocompetent mice and protects immunocompromised mice from lethal challenge. The
role of antibodies in protection was demonstrated in a passive transfer study where immune sera was injected
into naïve immunocompromised mice and full protection was achieved after lethal virus challenge. The overall
goal of the current Phase IIB renewal research is to support preclinical efforts to further advance the CHIKV
E2/E1 recombinant subunit vaccine candidate formulated with the next-generation adjuvant SLA-LSQ. These
efforts will enable human clinical trial evaluation and further the potential for commercialization. The proposed
research aims to 1) Evaluate the E2/E1 vaccine in chronic disease and durability studies; 2) Prepare cGMP
lots of E2/E1 vaccine antigen; 3) Submit a pre-IND package to FDA for review and conduct a rabbit toxicology
study; and 4) Prepare and submit IND to the FDA. Completion of the proposed work will promote the clinical
advancement of a safe and stable vaccine alternative using an established recombinant protein manufacturing
platform that can combat the significant disease threat posed by CHIKV."

The inner blood-retina barrier (iBRB), formed by retinal endothelial cells (RECs) and pericytes, and supported

healthy iBRB. In Aim 2, we will develop a tissue-engineered capillary model of the healthy iBRB. In Aim 3, we
will increase the complexity of iBRB models’ extracellular mimicry environment.
In vitro microphysiological models capable of recapitulating the healthy iBRB can be applied to examine tissue
perturbations towards addressing the knowledge gaps in our understanding of the processes that lead to retinal
vascular dysfunction. Challenges in developing such in vitro model include a need for necessary cellular
components, physiological and pathological environment mimetics, and controlled perfusion conditions.
Moreover, there are significant differences along the arterio-venous axis, from arterioles to capillaries to venules,
in physical dimensions, flow rates, and supporting cell organization. Therefore, the significance of this work
lies in developing mimicry iBRB models that further capture different zonations in the retina’s vascular system.
No model has been developed that uses human retina vascular cells and astrocytes in a 3D setting with
controllable perfusion at the post-capillary venule and capillary size scales, and no study further introduced
changes in oxygen concentration and matrix mechanics that allows an understanding of the impact on the retinal
barrier function, underscoring the innovation herein.
We use cutting-edge tissue-engineered microvessel models, stem cells, and biomaterials to develop iBRB in
vitro models. Successful completion of the Aims is ensured by the interdisciplinary environment at Duke
University and Johns Hopkins University, as well as the collaborative track record among Drs. Sharon Gerecht
and Peter Searson, and newly joined Drs. Jeremy Kay and Xi Chen, with relevant neuroscience and clinical
research expertise. The proposed work will engineer the next generation of human iBRB microphysiological
systems that will enable future mechanistic studies of tissue development, function, and aging in health and
disease states."
10822567,"Project Summary: Targeted degradation of NaV1.8 as a therapeutic strategy for pain.
Chronic pain is a massive global health burden, and therapeutic options for pain are limited and have a spectrum
of adverse effects. Alternative treatments for pain that are specific, effective, and non-addictive are an urgent
need. NaV1.8 channels are critical determinants of nociceptor excitability—they contribute to most of the current
underlying the rising phase of action potentials and have been implicated in human pain conditions and in animal
models of pain. Gain-of-function mutations in NaV1.8 result in painful neuropathies in humans, and a loss-of-
function in NaV1.8 dulls pain sensitivity in animal models. This genetic dichotomy suggests that reducing sodium
influx through NaV1.8 channels can provide analgesia without CNS side-effects or addictive potential. To date,
the principal strategy for targeting these channels has been to directly inhibit sodium conductance through the
channel. While promising, agents with this mechanism of action have not yet been deployed in the clinic. An
innovative approach may be to reduce the number of channels present at the neuronal surface by selective
degradation.
I have generated a bifunctional protein (named UbiquiNaV) composed of a NaV1.8 selective binding sequence
and the catalytic domain of the NEDD4 ubiquitin ligase. This engineered protein should bind specifically to NaV1.8
and subsequently ubiquitinate the channel, targeting it for degradation. My preliminary data shows that
expression of UbiquiNaV in rat DRG neurons reduces NaV1.8 current. This proposal will test the hypothesis that
this bifunctional molecule will reduce nociceptor excitability via selective degradation of NaV1.8 channels. In Aim
1, I will investigate the specificity of UbiquiNaV for NaV1.8 and demonstrate how UbiquiNaV expression impacts
rat nociceptor excitability. Aim 2 will use a live-cell imaging assay developed in our lab coupled with an inducible
activation mechanism to examine the temporal and spatial regulation of NaV1.8 channels in DRG neurons by
UbiquiNaV. Together, my work will a) delineate the mechanism of action of this newly engineered bifunctional
molecule, and b) reveal the selectivity of UbiquiNaV for NaV1.8. In doing so, this work will demonstrate the viability
of targeted degradation of NaV1.8 as an analgesic strategy."
10809032,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The ε4 variant of apolipoprotein E (APOE4) is the strongest and most common genetic risk factor for sporadic
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which makes up more than 95% of AD cases. APOE4 has been demonstrated to
contribute to a number of molecular processes implicated as promoting AD pathology, including accelerated
aggregation of amyloid-β and tau proteins, increased immunoreactivity, altered lipid metabolism, and impaired
cerebral blood flow, but an over-arching mechanism of the conveyed AD risk remains unclear. As a leading risk
factor for atherosclerosis as well as AD, APOE4 has profound effects on vasculature. Previous studies have
found dysregulated neurovascular coupling, high levels of the vasodilator nitric oxide, and impaired flow of
cerebrospinal fluid around arteries in the brain, suggesting decreased glymphatic clearance, a process that
occurs most dramatically during sleep. Consequently, physiological sleep patterns are also known to be
disrupted in AD, suggesting a common theme in many of the identified APOE4-dysregulated processes. We
propose that altered neurovascular coupling and vasodilation will alter sleep stage patterns and disrupt
sleep, which will impair the clearance of cellular waste products from the brain. Many of these waste
products, such as protein aggregates, inflammatory cytokines, and metabolites can be neurotoxic, and can
create a positive feedback cycle as they in turn affect neural activity and vascular integrity and function, further
disrupting sleep. To test this idea, we will combine the neurobiological and technical expertise of three research
groups studying distinct levels of brain function to perform an integrative, multi-scale study of brain physiology
and function in knock-in mice carrying humanized APOE4 and APOE3. First, we will use custom-developed
hardware for chronic, long-term EEG monitoring of APOE4 and APOE3 mice and specialized machine learning
for real-time characterization of sleep stages to identify shifts in sleep patterns and quality over the course of
aging (3 months to 15 months). Second, we will quantify impairment of cortical vasodilation and vasoreactivity
by conducting 2-photon imaging to measure the diameter of cortical arteries in behaving APOE4 and APOE3
mice, both awake and in natural sleep, at different time points over the course of aging. Third, we will perform
multiplexing and -omics assays of brain tissue from APOE4 and APOE3 mice during day (light) and night (dark)
over the course of aging to quantify the levels of inflammatory cytokines and metabolites. Finally, we will further
test our hypothesis and attempt to ameliorate AD-promoting pathology by introducing exercise as a potent
vasodilator and stimulus of cerebrovascular health. Upon completion of the proposed work, we will have
determined the trajectories of altered sleep stages and quality, impaired vasodilation, and dysregulated
production and clearance of immune and metabolic products in APOE4, and tested the relationship between
these pathologies by introducing exercise from young age to ameliorate vascular dysfunction."
10807694,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD; methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone) are highly efficacious
treatments for OUD; risk of fatal and nonfatal overdose is significantly reduced during their use. However,
MOUDs are vastly underutilized, and MOUD adoption is particularly low in residential treatment programs
(RTPs). Individuals with OUD are particularly vulnerable to overdose directly following discharge from controlled
environments such as RTPs when tolerance is greatly diminished. RTPs therefore represent a novel touchpoint
for initiating MOUD treatment for individuals with OUD, and additional research is urgently needed to identify key
factors that support scaling-up of MOUD in these settings. Recent policy changes by the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS) allowed state Medicaid programs to reimburse services delivered in Institutions
for Mental Disease (IMDs; “IMD waiver”), i.e., RTPs with 16 or more beds, and required RTPs ensure access to
MOUD. This presents a unique opportunity to study MOUD adoption in RTPs and learn about the factors that
support its uptake by a particularly vulnerable population, Medicaid beneficiaries with OUD. The overall goal of
this K-99/R-00 Pathway to Independence application is to supplement the candidate’s existing skillset by
providing structured, intensive training in implementation science frameworks and study design, integration and
analysis of large data sets to study state policies targeting adoption of evidence-based addiction treatment, and
career development activities during the K-99 phase of the award. This training will take place in an outstanding
training environment, fostered by an exceptional mentoring team including Dr. Stephen Crystal (Primary Mentor)
and co-mentors Drs. Shawna Hudson, Frederick Altice, and Ayse Akincigil. The candidate will work closely with
her primary mentor to gain expertise in working with “big data” including national Medicaid claims to study state
policy natural experiments. Drs. Altice and Hudson will provide training in implementation science frameworks
and study designs including mixed methods. Dr. Akincigil will support skills development in the application of
novel advanced econometric methods relevant to observational study designs. The applicant will also complete
formal coursework and workshops in these subject areas and participate in career development activities.
Applying these newly acquired skills, this research proposes to: characterize state strategies for scaling-up
MOUD in RTPs nationally (K-99 Aim 1), define national trends in MOUD utilization trajectories during RTP
episodes in early-adopter states (K99 Aim 2), describe NJ RTP provider experiences with MOUD scale-up (R00
Aim 1), identify predictors of trajectory group membership in all IMD-waivered states and test the effects of a
New Jersey Medicaid RTP MOUD pay-for-performance incentive (R00 Aim 2). The proposed training and
research program aligns with the candidate’s long-term goal of developing an independent research program
focused on the implementation of state policy interventions targeting the scale-up of evidence-based practices
in addiction treatment settings."
10807365,"Project Summary/Abstract
This proposal presents a four-year Research Career Development program focused on
understanding the mechanisms by which myopia increases glaucoma susceptibility. The
candidate is currently a Clinical Instructor/PhD candidate with 80% protected research time, who
was the first to complete the combined Residency/PhD program at the SUNY College of
Optometry. The proposal builds on the candidate’s previous clinical and research experience in
ocular disease, myopia, and glaucoma, and integrates her mentors’ unique fields of expertise.
Under the guidance of her primary mentor and co-mentors Drs. Alexandra Benavente-Perez,
Stewart Bloomfield, Miduturu Srinivas and Suresh Viswanathan, she will gain a deeper
understanding of cellular and electrophysiology methodologies applied to this proposal. The
research plan proposed will provide a distinctive set of multidisciplinary skills to develop the
candidate into an independent investigator in the translational research field of myopic
complications, in particular glaucoma.
Myopia is projected to become a public health crisis that will affect half the world population by
2050, and is characterized by excessive eye growth that can affect the structure and function of
vital cells that form the retinal neurovascular unit. Glaucoma is a multifactorial blinding disease
estimated to affect more than 120 million people worldwide by 2040. While strong evidence
confirms that myopic patients are at higher risk of glaucomatous degeneration, the mechanisms
behind this association are unknown. Our current understanding of this relationship has two major
gaps: 1) the longitudinal effect that myopic eye growth and stretch have on the cellular structure
and function of ganglion cells, glia and vasculature remains unknown, and 2) there are no non-
human primate (NHP) animal models that combine myopia and glaucoma to study how myopic
progression predisposes the retina to glaucomatous remodeling. I hypothesize that myopia and
glaucoma are linked via the effect that myopic stretch has on the neurovascular unit. The overall
goals of this proposal are to define the longitudinal effect that myopia has on 1) retinal ganglion
cells, 2) astrocytes and 3) associated vasculature, and their relationship with glaucoma
susceptibility. This proposal is innovative because it focuses on studying longitudinally three key
neurovascular elements affected by myopia, using a novel NHP experimental model with anatomy
and physiology comparable to the human eye, and induced with myopia and subsequently
glaucoma. This research will have a direct positive impact and is significant because it is expected
to provide strong evidence of the unknown nature of the myopia-glaucoma relationship."
10800746,"In the US, perinatal hypoxia-ischemia (HI) encephalopathy brain injury remains one of the major causes of
cerebral palsy and other life-long neurological disability. The life-time cost for patients with cerebral palsy is
estimated to reach 11.5 billion dollars. This dictates a need for therapeutic strategies based on better
understanding the mechanisms of hypoxic ischemic injury. HI-reperfusion-associated oxidative stress negatively affects glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, mitochondrial
energy metabolism, and causes abnormal permeability of the inner membrane and oxidative stress. These serve
as the major factors associated with brain tissue damage in HI. However, the exact mechanisms of the so-called
secondary energy failure in ischemia/reperfusion are not known. We propose that, brain oxygen deprivation
leads to conditions in which mitochondrial complex I loses its natural cofactor, flavin mononucleotide (FMN). Our
preliminary data identifies the mechanism of flavin loss by mitochondria and show that it is taking place in the
brain in vivo and can be prevented by the administration of FMN precursor, riboflavin and hypothermia. We pursue a novel hypothesis which is consistent with experimental data observed in HI and stroke models: increased ROS generation and mitochondrial bioenergetics failure. This project investigates preclinical
approaches to attenuate this damage by modulating FMN handling. The data obtained in this study will
significantly alter the current paradigm of the origin of neuronal ischemia/reperfusion damage. We aim to prove
the major role of FMN release from mitochondria in bioenergetics failure in stroke and HI. The preclinical impact
of this project is to provide a rationale for further clinical studies aimed at the reduction of post-HI brain injury."
10799482,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Microglia, the primary mediators of innate immune activation in the brain, are increasingly recognized as key
modulators of neuronal activity and excitability. There is growing evidence in many neurological diseases,
including traumatic brain injury (TBI), that prolonged activation of the innate immune system can impede repair
and promote disease, and it is not understood if or how microglia's impact on neuronal excitability might
contribute or protect. One interesting microglial subtype that may be critical in the monitoring and feedback of
neuronal excitability is the perineuronal satellite microglia. These microglia are juxtaposed to neurons with their
soma and processes entwined around the neuronal cell body. Our published and preliminary data in TBI show
a dramatic increase in the percentage of neurons with satellite microglia at both one week15, and several
months after TBI that is associated with network hyperexcitability and behavioral dysfunction with deficits in
reversal learning. However, our preliminary data indicate that satellite microglia suppress neuronal excitability,
in control mice, but lose this ability in chronic TBI with an associated decrease in expression of P2Y12
receptors. With this proposal, we will investigate the role of perineuronal satellite microglia and P2Y12 receptors
in neuronal, network and cognitive dysfunction after TBI. In aim 1, we will utilize transgenic mice that allow
identification of microglia and associated neuronal subtypes to establish cell type-specific interactions of
satellite microglia with neurons and the associated effect on neuronal function. In aim 2, we will test the
mechanistic role of P2Y12 signaling in satellite microglial-associated neuronal interaction and function, network
hyperexcitability and cognitive deficits after TBI. In aim 3, we will validate satellite microglial-neuronal
interactions, P2Y12R expression, function and microglial expression profiles in human tissue in the context of
TBI compared to our murine model. Results from these studies will yield an in-depth understanding of how
microglial-neuronal interactions contribute to changes in neuronal excitability after injury and will give insight
into therapeutic targets for TBI-induced circuit and cognitive dysfunction."
10799382,"Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-
1RA) are rapidly changing the therapeutic landscape for patients with diabetes and kidney disease, but are
underutilized in high-risk populations. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have robustly demonstrated the
cardiovascular and renoprotective benefits of these agents. For the first time in decades, we have new drugs to
slow kidney disease progression, yet newer medication classes are still underprescribed in patients with DKD.
One of the major prescribing barriers is the lack of safety data in real-world patients with DKD, a
complex, older population with multimorbidity and polypharmacy, who are at greater risk for adverse events
and drug-drug interactions (DDIs), but who are underrepresented or excluded from RCTs. This dearth of safety
data cannot be addressed by RCTs, since the RCTs were powered for effectiveness, not safety, did not
represent real-world patients with DKD who are an older, frailer population, and did not address DDIs in this
population with a high burden of polypharmacy. Yet, over time, these drugs should and will be prescribed to a
broader spectrum of patients with DKD. Methodologically rigorous studies using large, national healthcare
databases are an ideal vehicle to address these knowledge gaps with much larger sample sizes than in RCTs
across the broad spectrum of patients with DKD. Our overarching goal is to develop a framework to optimize
the safety of newer diabetes medications in real-world patients with DKD. We will investigate kidney-related
and other safety outcomes that were not systematically evaluated in RCTs in patients with DKD, using a new-
user, active comparator cohort approach (Aim 1). We will develop two safety monitoring approaches to assess
both anticipated and unanticipated adverse event signals associated with the newer diabetes medications as
they are used in real-world patients with DKD (Aim 2). Patients with DKD are at higher risk for DDIs since they
are older with impaired kidney function and have more multimorbidity and polypharmacy. We propose a novel
two-stage screening approach to detect and evaluate clinically relevant drug-drug interactions that could affect
the safety profile of newer diabetes medications in patients with DKD (Aim 3). This proposal will advance our
understanding of these drugs’ safety and, thus, will help overcome barriers to prescribing in patients with DKD
who may largely benefit from them. The filling of critical knowledge gaps and new insights regarding safe
prescribing will significantly influence the clinical management of patients with DKD."
10800808,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Growing up in poverty is associated with emotion regulation (ER) problems, which increase risk for
psychopathology and disease as children age. High quality early care and education (ECE) programs were
designed to prevent the negative effects of poverty and its associated stressors by strengthening young
children’s ER capacity, through responsive and nurturing relationships with teachers and evidence-based
teaching practices and curriculum. However, real-world ECE programs lack the internal support to sustain best
practices that are linked to positive child outcomes. Teachers are trained to use evidence-based skills by external
consultants or interventionists, but then drift from these practices once those supports are no longer available.
Thus, the public health need to increase quality of support for teachers within an ECE program cannot be
overstated, especially given findings that lack of support from program directors is associated with reduced use of
evidence-based practices over time, and teacher stress, burnout, and turnover, which leads to poor
socioemotional environments for children. Therefore, the proposed study aims to train ECE directors to use
Reflective Practice and Supervision (RP/S), a relationship-based, culturally responsive model of supervision, with
their teachers to improve teaching quality and increase use of evidence-based skills to promote adaptive ER in
children. This innovative research will be conducted in two phases: an open trial and a fully powered cluster
randomized controlled trial (CRT). The goal of the Aim 1 open trial is to assess feasibility, acceptability, and
implementation barriers and facilitators. Quantitative and qualitative data will be used to refine RP/S prior to the
CRT. The second phase will test RP/S against a waitlist control condition (i.e., standard administrative
supervision). Aim 2 will determine whether RP/S is associated with increases in teaching quality and teacher use
of evidence-based skills from pre- to post, and at 3-month follow-up. Aim 3 will determine whether RP/S is
associated with increases in adaptive ER among children, measured with a multi-method assessment battery.
This will be the first rigorous evaluation of RP/S as an enhancement to ECE programming, and results will be of
high interest to local and national stakeholders. A highly structured training plan will ensure achievement of the
proposed research aims. Specifically, the PI will receive specialized training in (1) infant mental health, (2)
implementation within ECE systems, (3) pragmatic CRT development, delivery, and evaluation, (4) clinical trial
and multilevel modeling methods, and (5) mentoring and leadership skills. Training will be guided by an
outstanding mentorship team with highly relevant expertise and outstanding track records of mentorship and
collaboration. The proposed research and training plan is further supported by the rich training environment in the
Brown Medical School and Bradley Hospital. Through this K23, the PI will launch her career as an independent
clinical scientist focused on developing and evaluating systems-based preventive interventions in community
settings to improve emotion regulation in young children exposed to adversity."

Our healthcare system faces larger numbers of individuals with early to late Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and other
neurodegenerative disorders requiring anesthesia associated procedures for serious health related conditions
(e.g., cardiac), screening (e.g., colonoscopy), or quality of life improvement (e.g., joint replacement). Despite
evidence that preoperative cognitive status is a risk factor for negative post-operative outcomes, there is a
scarcity of research addressing perioperative cognitive-biomarker-anesthesia interactions, and evidence based
anesthesia-surgical practices for patients with prodromal or diagnosed dementias. The K07 applicant- an NIH
funded independent investigator and board certified neuropsychologist with expertise in the cognitive sequelae
and associated neuroimaging markers of AD, vascular dementia, and other neurodegenerative disorders, and
cognitive and neuroimaging predictors of perioperative cognitive complications and delirium. The applicant (with
support of the institution) is proposing a Perioperative Cognitive Anesthesia Network (PeCAN) Program for AD
and related dementia. The purpose– to promote institutional and community awareness of cognition and memory
in older adults electing surgical procedures with anesthesia, intensify collaborations on AD biomarkers-
anesthesia interactions, and promote translation of research findings to clinical care. The applicant will complete
advanced leadership training and three programmatic aims. Aim 1- convene a multidisciplinary advisory team to
establish four integrated PeCAN research cores targeting AD and related dementia perioperative research.
Cores include a Cognitive-Clinical Core, a Neuroimaging Core, a Biomarker Core, and a Data Science Core.
Aim 2- enhance defined and supportive pathways to the PeCAN cores so that early stage investigators can
efficiently initiate and complete perioperative-neurodegenerative research. The applicant will integrate pathways
between multiple institutional resources including NIH funded 1Florida Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center,
Evelyn F. McKnight Brain Institute, the University of Florida (UF) Institute on Aging Pepper Center, and the UF
Fixel Center for Neurological Diseases. Aim 3- promote the emergence of highly trained scientists and educators
for innovative team science addressing perioperative neuronal risk and mechanisms for protection. Methods will
involve implementation of a certificate program, interdisciplinary team-science research opportunities, and pilot
funding supported through this grant and institutional matching funds. Trainees will initially include appropriate
predoctoral T32 trainees, neuropsychology fellows, and anesthesiology fellows. Milestones- annual analyses of
programmatic strengths/weaknesses, multidisciplinary proposal submissions, and evidence of trainee success

10800816,"Airway smooth muscle (ASM) is a key cell type in asthma, contributing to airway hyperreactivity (AHR) and
remodeling (proliferation, fibrosis). Asthma is more prominent in women and multiple studies highlight a role for
sex hormone effects on ASM. However, it is unclear whether sex hormones are protective or detrimental, given
observations of enhanced inflammation vs. promotion of bronchodilation.
These uncertainties led us to consider
if mechanisms upstream or even independent of sex hormones play a role, or alternatively, if asthma involves
loss of intrinsic protective mechanisms. Drawing upon data in CNS, particularly in puberty which associates with
more asthma in women, and preliminary data, we propose that the gonadotrophin regulators kisspeptins (Kp)
and their receptor (KISS1R) serve a normally protective, anti-remodeling role when locally expressed in airways.
We further propose that inflammation/asthma and estrogens compromise Kp/KISS1R roles.
There is currently
no information on Kp/ KISS1R in airways and/or in asthma, but potential relevance lies in the fact that Kp
signaling can regulate proliferation, migration and signaling elements also important for ASM remodeling and
contractility.
Preliminary studies show human ASM from females have less Kp and KISS1R compared to males,
further reduced during asthma/inflammation. In addition, physiological levels of 17-β-estradiol (E2) reduce Kp in
ASM. Functionally, Kp via KISS1R downregulates ASM proliferation and remodeling and reduces ASM [Ca2+]i.
In a mixed allergen mouse model of asthma, Kp agonist (metastin) improved lung resistance and compliance.
Our overall hypothesis is that ASM-derived Kp signaling has a protective role lost in inflammation and asthma,
permitting AHR and remodeling. Our proposed studies will define the role of Kp and KISS1R in asthma via three
Aims: Aim 1: Determine mechanisms by which inflammation and E2 regulate Kp/KISS1R in human ASM in the
context of asthma. Aim 2: Determine mechanisms by which Kp/KISS1R signaling influences ASM structure and
function in the context of asthma. Aim 3: In a mouse model of allergic asthma, determine role of Kp/KISS1R in
AHR and remodeling. Using human ASM cells and tissues of male vs. female (asthmatics vs. non-asthmatics),
Aim 1 explores the idea that asthma and inflammation or E2 decrease expression of Kp and KISS1R. Aim 2
explores Kp/KISS1R-based signaling in human ASM proliferation, migration, ECM production, and autocrine role
of ASM-derived Kp, further exploring interactions with inflammatory cytokines or E2. We will also explore if
Kp/KISS1R is important for Ca2+/contractility. Aim 3 applies a mixed allergen model of asthma to WT and KISS1R
KO mice to study importance of Kp (metastin vs. KISS1R inhibitor). Ovariectomy (OVX) is used to distinguish E2

10925423,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this project we aim to validate tools that researchers (including other All of Us researchers) can utilize to
assess and follow the severity of metabolic syndrome (MetS) among study participants, and we will also
evaluate characteristics of MetS among minoritized groups for use in personalized medicine in clinical
practice. MetS is a cluster of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors that occur together more frequently
than would be expected by chance, as though they are driven by a common underlying process that is related
to risk for future Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and CVD. We previously formulated MetS severity z-scores (MetS-Z)
specific to sex and to three different race/ethnicities (individuals who are non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black or Hispanic), but we did not previously have statistical power to assess for—and if necessary derive—
unique MetS-Z scores for other racial/ethnic and sexual/gender groups. In particular Asian American
individuals have been noted to manifest insulin resistance at a lower BMI (suggesting unique manifestation of
MetS), and many sexual/gender sub-groups have been noted to have high levels of chronic stress from
discrimination, which could also affect MetS severity.
We propose to use confirmatory factor analysis to assess MetS severity among multiple minoritized
race/ethnicity and sexual/gender groups in All of Us. If the loading factors for the individual MetS components
differ for a specific population sub-group, we will derive a unique MetS severity z-score for that group (e.g.
among individuals who are Asian American); if the MetS loading factors are similar to other groups, we will
utilize the corresponding MetS-Z score for that group’s set of loading factors. We will then assess how these
MetS-Z scores relate to social determinants of health (SDOH), including perceived discrimination and
depressive symptoms— the physiological stress from which can exacerbate MetS. This may help in
highlighting the importance of assessing and considering SDOH in clinical care.
Finally, we will evaluate how baseline MetS-Z is related to longitudinal risk for T2D and CVD, including
assessing for whether this differs by racial/ethnic and sexual gender sub-groups. Our overall goal is to
provide support for personalized medicine considerations for all individuals, including minoritized groups.
These data will help validate specific MetS-Z scores that can be used to assess relationships with metabolic
health for other topics of interest to multiple investigator teams in All of Us."
10812227,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most common congenital disorders, affecting about 1% of all live
births. More than half of children with moderate or severe CHD have neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD)
that persist into later life. Quantitative methods that can objectively identify subjects at high risk for NDD as
early as possible are needed to allow for characterization of the mechanisms underlying NDD and monitor the
success of potential therapeutic interventions. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies provide
evidence for a prenatal origin of NDD by detecting reduced global brain volumes and gyrification in fetuses with
CHD. However, these whole-brain measures do not provide insight into regional brain vulnerabilities or second
trimester differences in brain development. In addition, no studies have yet explored the potential role of
genetic variants and attempted to disentangle the relative contributions of genetic and hemodynamic factors on
prenatal brain development in CHD. Since patients with single-ventricle (SV) CHD suffer high rates of NDD
and show both severe in utero reduction in oxygenated cerebral blood supply and frequent damaging genetic
variants, fetal SV CHD cohort is an ideal group in which to explore markers of altered early brain development
influenced by genetic and/or cerebral hemodynamic factors. This study will examine sulcal patterns and
regional cortical growth (thickness and surface area) to indicate the effects of genetic variants and altered
cerebral hemodynamics respectively using a large dataset of retrospective and prospective longitudinal MRIs
from the second trimester to birth with three time points in 175 SV CHD and 260 typically developing (TD)
subjects. Sulcal pattern development will be compared between SV CHD and TD subjects and correlated with
rare damaging variants in high heart expression (HHE) genes and presence of neuroprotective APOE allele in
SV CHD. We will also develop surface-based regional analysis of fetal cortical thickness and surface area.
Regional cortical thickness and surface area will be compared between SV CHD and TD subjects and
correlated with different types of cerebral blood flow in SV CHD. We hypothesize that sulcal pattern alterations
will be detected in SV CHD in the second trimester and more abnormal in SV CHD subjects with rare
damaging variants in HHE and/or neuroresilience APOE genes. Differences in cortical thickness and surface
area between SV CHD and TD subjects may be regionally inhomogeneous and more severe in the frontal
regions. Regional cortical growth will be more reduced in SV CHD subjects with aortic outflow obstruction and
retrograde aortic arch flow compared to the subjects with pulmonary obstruction with anterograde arch flow or
unobstructed outflow tracts. This project would allow early identification of the relative roles of altered genetics
and cerebral perfusion and lay the foundation for early selection and optimization of individual therapy and
deciding the efficacy of the interventions in CHD."
10812231,"This application is a competing renewal of the ""Vervet Research Colony as a Biomedical Resource"" 
(VRC, P40-OD010965). The VRC is the only NIH-funded biomedical research resource for US-born 
vervet/African green monkeys (AGM; Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus) and has been continuously funded 
since 2005. The VRC serves a wide range of local, regional and national investigators by providing 
animals, biological samples, data, consultation and training pertaining to the use of vervets/AGMs 
as multi-categorical, translational models of human disease. Since the previous renewal, the VRC 
has provided resources to over 100 investigators, including over 250 animals and over 1,500 
biological samples, as well as data and consultation. The VRC has also provided the necessary 
infrastructure and technical expertise enabling the on-site use of over 600 animals across 30 
different studies. The VRC has facilitated critical translational research across a wide variety of 
disciplines, including: a) the development of the vervet as an emerging nonhuman primate model of 
Alzheimer's disease risk with a focus on the assessment of amyloid burden, neurodegenerative 
disease biomarkers, and synaptic degeneration; b) investigations into the efficacy and enhancement 
of vaccines for infectious diseases such as neonatal influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and 
dengue fever; c) studies focused on the etiology and health consequences of diabetes, metabolic 
disease and obesity; d) the development of novel, non-invasive biomedical imaging methodologies; 
and e) the expansion of the critical genetic resources available for vervets, including the 
sequencing of the vervet genome. The aims of the VRC resource are to: 1) provide the scientific 
community with access to animals, biological samples, data and expertise to facilitate the use of 
vervets for a wide-range of biomedical research; 2) to provide exceptional training opportunities 
for veterinarians and researchers interested in using vervets for translational research, and to 
serve as a platform for community and scientific outreach to foster better understanding of the use 
of nonhuman primates in biomedical research; and 3) to enhance the resource by engaging in applied 
research focused on continuing genetic and phenotypic characterization of vervets across the 
lifespan and evaluation of the vervet as a potential translational model in novel research areas.

Project Summary
 Epidemiologists have long recognized the immense potential of targeting high-risk ‘core groups’ and
‘superspreaders’ to efficiently control infectious diseases. For HIV/AIDS, high-risk behaviors, such as in persons
who inject drugs (PWID) and female sex workers, establish core groups of superspreaders that drive disease
spread, exemplified by the HIV outbreak among PWID in Scott County, Indiana (Peters et al. NEJM 2016;
Campbell et al. JID 2017). Failure to target disease-control measures to these groups substantially weakens
the ability to contain HIV outbreaks and reduce incidence (UNAIDS Global AIDS Update, 2019). Unfortunately,
despite tremendous potential benefits, targeting disease-control measures to these high-risk groups is often not
feasible in practice due to the high cost and effort of reaching them (Maxmen Nature, 2018).
 To reach these key populations, this project will capitalize on gene drive technologies (National
Academy of Sciences, 2016 report). Gene drives are synthetic constructs engineered to expand within key
populations, genetically displace the pathogen, and thereby control disease spread. Modern gene drives—
based upon Cas9—are currently in field trials to control malaria in Burkina Faso, Brazil, and other locations. The
rationale for an HIV gene drive is based upon our extensive preliminary studies showing that prototype HIV gene
drives have demonstrated efficacy in humanized mice and could constitute single-administration interventions
with a high barrier to resistance (Tanner et al, Nature, in review). Epidemiological analyses indicate that gene
drives would spread through high-risk HIV-infected groups via the same risk factors as HIV. In particular, for
injection drug use in PWID—when multiple HIV variants co-transmit—gene-drive platforms would be uniquely
suited to overcome existing targeting obstacles and reach precisely those hardest-to-reach superspreaders.
 This proposal will test a prototype gene drive for HIV. First, prototype gene drives will be tested in patient
cells from PWID to validate preliminary in vitro efficacy in primary cells and humanized mice. Second,
established non-human primate (NHP) models of HIV infection will be used to assay safety (immunogenicity and
genotoxicity), efficacy, and the potential of gene drives to expand and transmit within HIV-infected PWID
populations using an injection drug use animal-to-animal transmission model in NHPs. Finally, based on our
positive humanized-mouse data and existing clinical trial precedents (e.g., NCT03617198, a 24-week ATI trial
that was approved based on humanized-mouse data) we will initiate an early Phase-I/0 clinical intervention trial
in an end-of-life HIV cohort (Last Gift cohort, a drug-use population). This trial will test safety and efficacy of the
HIV gene drive in lowering set-point viremia. Overall, these studies will propel development of gene drive
technologies to target high-risk PWID populations. Ultimately, HIV gene drives could complement and serve as
a platform to incorporate existing gene-therapy approaches (e.g. RNAi, eCD4, etc.), thereby yielding the high-
efficiency benefits of targeted control without the cost and challenge of identifying and reaching high-risk groups."

The gut microbiota has been linked to many aspects of human health and disease. These finding have ignited
efforts to precisely modulate gut microbiota composition and function to promote health-associated features.
The nutrient landscape within the gut shapes, and is influenced by, the gut microbiota. Bacteria respond to
available nutrients and utilize them to support their own metabolism, sharing the metabolic by-products with
other bacteria and the host. Carbohydrates within the gut, both consumed in the diet and produced by the host,
impact gut bacteria composition and function via their utilization as a carbon source. The biological function of
the polysaccharides that cover gut bacteria however, remains unclear. Bacterial cell surface polysaccharides
act as a barrier between the microbe and its environment, enhancing bacterial growth and survival through
mechanisms that include resistance to toxic small molecules, nutrient adaptation, and immune evasion. The
central hypothesis I will test in this proposal is that microbiota bacterial polysaccharides modulate gut
community structure and function via utilization as a nutrient by other community members, and
through interaction with soluble immunoregulatory proteins. AIM 1 will employ isolated bacterial
polysaccharides and in vitro growth assays to identify genetic features that enable utilization of bacterial
polysaccharides. AIM 2 will define whether bacterial polysaccharides are consumed in vivo by cultured,
genome sequenced microbial communities installed in gnotobiotic mice using microscopic recoverable
paramagnetic beads coated in polysaccharides. AIM3 will test whether cell surface polysaccharides from
probiotic dietary supplements alter gut microbiota polysaccharide utilization and recognition of community
members by immunoregulatory proteins in the gut lumen of gnotobiotic mice. This series of experiments that
blends chemistry, glycobiology, genomics, and gnotobiotic mouse models will define mechanisms of bacterial
polysaccharide utilization, increase understanding of how nutrients in the gut shape the microbiota, and
suggest a bioactive component of bacterial dietary supplements. These combined finding should improve
development of microbiota-derived and -directed therapeutics for targeted microbiota manipulation.
This award will also support by career development. During completion of the supervised portion of this grant I
will gain critical computational research skills that includes bacterial genome sequencing and annotation,
bacterial RNA-sequencing to characterize function, and metagenomic analysis. Ultimately, this award will
facilitate my successful transition into an independent academic position at a research-intensive university
where I will lead, teach, and mentor an interdisciplinary group of students, postdocs, and clinicians defining
mechanisms of microbiota assembly, function, and regulation with a goal to translate my findings into methods
for targeted microbiota manipulation to improve human health."

COVID-19 is caused by a bat-borne coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that has resulted in more than 1 million deaths
in the USA. Experimental and bioinformatic analyses suggest cricetid rodents, but not murid rodents, may be
susceptible to the virus. We determined that two such cricetid rodents, the North American deer mouse
(Peromyscus maniculatus) and California deer mouse (P. californicus) are susceptible, with some of the latter
species developing severe disease that required euthanasia. This raises the concern that spillback from
humans or susceptible domesticated animals, such as mins (Neogale vison), to North American cricetid
rodents could occur and lead to establishment of SARS-CoV-2 in secondary reservoir hosts in the New World.
Several rodent species in Europe and Asia have been found to harbor coronaviruses but, surprisingly, there
are no reports wild rodents in the New World have been examined for coronaviruses, even though they are
found in several bat species. Moreover, because of disease that occurred in California deer mice, it is possible
that it or other North American rodents could serve as new pathogenesis models for COVID-19. To examine
these possibilities, we will survey cricetid rodents in Colorado for the presence of coronaviruses, which we
have detected at a site in Utah, and generate genome sequences of these viruses for phylogenetic analysis
and important domains (e.g., protease cleavage sites). We will also determine the T cell response of deer mice
vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 using single-cell RNA seq analysis and compared to unvaccinated deer mice.
This will lay the foundation of using deer mice as a long-lived small animal model (8 years), which cannot be
replicated with Syrian hamsters or human ACE2 laboratory mice (2 years). Together this work will determine
coronavirus diversity in North American rodents, and whether the deer mouse can serve as a durable immunity
model for SARS-CoV-2."
10935986,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacteriophages (phages) are gaining traction as antibacterial therapeutics largely due to several high profile
uses as emergency-approved experimental biologics. A perceived problem with phage therapy is that the
development of bacterial phage resistance will curtail the use of phages as clinically relevant therapies. This
conclusion overlooks a fundamental flaw in the development of phage resistance, that is, bacteria often incur
reduced fitness as a result of acquired phage resistance. These fitness tradeoffs include enhanced antibiotic
susceptibility, reduced virulence, and the inability to stably colonize their host. The work described in this
proposal will capitalize on the emergence of phage resistance as a means to successfully treat recalcitrant
opportunistic pathogens that reside in the intestine. We will use the Gram-positive intestinal commensals and
opportunistic pathogens Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium as model organisms to determine
how phage resistance phenotypes influence their fitness in the intestine and whether these outcomes can be
leveraged as novel therapeutic approaches. Specifically, we will define the mechanisms that drive phage
resistance fitness defects of E. faecalis and E. faecium within the intestine by executing three specific aims: 1)
to define the mechanism(s) driving the intestinal colonization deficiency of phage resistant strains harboring cell
surface exopolysaccharide mutations; 2) to examine how phage-mediated mutations in the peptidoglycan
hydrolase gene sagA result in antibiotic sensitivity; and 3) to determine if phage-antibiotic combinations reduce
enterococcal intestinal colonization."

Acute alcohol use and intoxication proximally increase the likelihood of college students’ intimate partner
violence (IPV) perpetration underscoring the need to detect and intervene with alcohol-related IPV during critical
drinking periods. Problematically, retrospective self-reported alcohol use has been the only method used to
assess college students’ alcohol use in relation to IPV perpetration in their natural environment (e.g., ecological
momentary assessment [EMA]). College students’ self-reported alcohol use underestimates their breath alcohol
content (BrAC) by as much as 54% and is fraught with limitations; investigators’ ability to deliver and evaluate
crucially-needed ambulatory alcohol-related IPV interventions (e.g., just-in-time interventions) is hindered by
inaccurate alcohol assessment. Recent advancements in mobile breathalyzer technology allow investigators to
remotely and objectively assess undergraduates’ alcohol use and intoxication in naturalistic settings. When
paired with EMA of IPV, mobile breathalyzers offer a novel approach to strengthening alcohol-related IPV
monitoring; no study has used portable breathalyzers to remotely assess alcohol use in relation to IPV. As a
critical first step toward enhancing remotely-delivered alcohol-related IPV interventions, the overall objective of
the proposed study is to determine the feasibility of using smartphone-linked, portable breathalyzers in
conjunction with smartphone-based EMA to capture alcohol-related IPV episodes and contexts among heavy
drinking college students with a recent IPV history.
We will leverage our team’s established remote alcohol monitoring and EMA procedures to address three aims:
The first aim is to examine the feasibility and acceptability of using portable breathalyzers paired with EMA to
investigate the association between BrAC and IPV among heavy drinking, previously-aggressive college
students. The second aim is to determine if breathalyzer-derived BrAC is a stronger predictor of different forms
of IPV perpetration than is self-reported alcohol use, and whether there are gender differences in these
associations. Our exploratory aim is to examine contexts (e.g., where, when, and with whom one drinks) in
which alcohol-related IPV events occur, which will help optimize EMA delivery in future alcohol-related IPV
studies. Across 30 consecutive days, 100 heavy drinking college students with an IPV perpetration history will
use smartphones to complete 5 daily (1 morning, 4 evening) self-reports of IPV and drinking context;
smartphones will prompt 4 evening BrAC submissions to a smartphone-linked portable breathalyzer (plus event-
triggered reports) to provide the most rigorous, accurate, and ecologically-valid assessment of alcohol-related
IPV to date. Results will provide EMA+ feasibility data to inform a future R01 using EMA+ with a large sample of
couples to identify intra/interpersonal and contextual antecedents of college alcohol-related IPV. Consistent with
the NIAAA’s priorities, the proposed study will enhance methods of tracking alcohol-related IPV in college
students’ natural settings and is an essential first step toward strengthening alcohol-related IPV interventions."

Patient activation, cognition, and self-management for LVADs
We propose to study patient activation (PA) for patients with left-ventricular assist devices (LVADs).
LVADs are the most complex machines ever designed for home use with rigorous demands for self-
management (SM) of alarms, batteries, anticoagulation, and complications, in addition to the routine burden of
heart failure (HF) care. Since 2012, 27,000+ LVAD implantations have extended the life of the sickest HF
patients. Most LVADs are implanted permanently. LVAD SM must combat infection, stroke, GI bleed, and
device malfunction further challenged by medical comorbidities and tenuous caregiver availability. Healthcare
utilization (HCU) for post-LVAD complications is high and costly. PA is the willingness and ability to manage a
health condition and influences HF SM and HCU. PA can be improved with treatment. PA for LVAD patients
has received little attention and is not usually assessed before or after surgery. Cognitive impairment is
common in HF, reduces HF SM prior to LVAD, and impacts pre-LVAD candidacy decisions. Cognition affects
LVAD SM and predicts LVAD stroke, death and hospitalization, but the relationship between cognition, PA,
and LVAD SM is unknown. We believe PA influences the impact of cognition on outcomes and offers
unique insights and treatment opportunities for LVAD SM. We plan analyses of the relationships between
cognition, PA, LVAD SM, and HCU and preliminary examination of whether PA acts as a mediator for the
relationship of cognition with LVAD SM and HCU. Specifically, we will first examine the associations among
PA, cognition, LVAD SM (care-adherence reported by patients and caregivers) and LVAD HCU (total days out
of hospital, LVAD complications, telephone calls) through assessments 3-,6-,9-,12-months after LVAD surgery.
We will next explore whether PA behaves as a mediator of cognition for LVAD SM and HCU. This innovative,
interdisciplinary study will build the science for optimizing SM and HCU for patients with complex, chronic care
needs. As a modifiable construct, PA is a novel intervention target. Findings will identify relationships between
cognition, PA, and LVAD SM and optimal assessment points to guide future intervention trials. Results may be
relevant to PA and SM for the escalating number of HF patients without LVAD, as well as patients with other
chronic illnesses."

This research project focuses on the fibrinolysis system and its activity in regulating innate immunity. We have
shown that tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) functions as an antagonist of pro-inflammatory responses
triggered by Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) in macrophages and in vivo in mice. Mechanistically, the activity of tPA
is mediated by a receptor system that includes the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) and LDL Receptor-
related Protein-1 (LRP1). Although the function of enzymatically-active tPA in innate immunity is regulated by
the Serpin, PAI1, and by plasmin generation, enzymatically-inactive tPA (EI-tPA) is resistant to these regulatory
pathways. EI-tPA fails to inhibit pro-inflammatory responses mediated by Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs)
other than TLRs; however, in mouse models of disease in which multiple PRRs function in concert, including the
Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) colitis model and the K/BxN serum-transfer arthritis model, EI-tPA is efficacious
as a candidate therapeutic. In this application for continued support, we propose studies to elucidate the activity
of tPA and its receptors in regulating inflammation and determine the potential to generate novel anti-inflam-
matory drugs based on the structure of tPA. Four specific aims are proposed. In Specific Aim 1, the structural
elements in tPA required for regulation of innate immunity will be determined by genetic engineering. Novel
recombinant derivatives of EI-tPA will be developed and tested with the goal of optimizing tPA for use as a
candidate anti-inflammatory therapeutic in vivo. Specific Aim 2 is focused on understanding the anti-inflam-
matory cell-signaling pathway activated by tPA downstream of the NMDA-R. New preliminary results implicate
a novel system, involving Trk receptor transactivation by Src family kinases, which is previously undescribed in
macrophages and other inflammatory cells. The proposed studies in Specific Aim 2 will not only contribute to
our understanding of tPA signaling in general but also may identify novel intracellular targets for anti-inflam-
matory drug development based on our analysis of tPA-activated cell-signaling. In Specific Aim 3, we will breed
mice available in our laboratory to generate animals in which macrophages and other cells in which the LysM
promoter is active do not express the NMDA-R. This will allow us to definitively test the hypothesis that the anti-
inflammatory activity of EI-tPA in vivo, for example in neutralizing LPS toxicity, requires the NMDA-R and that
macrophages and/or neutrophils are EI-tPA target cells. In Specific Aim 4, we will study the activity of tPA and
its anti-inflammatory receptors, the NMDA-R and LRP1, in the DSS colitis model. Single-cell transcriptome
profiling studies are proposed to identify, in an unbiased manner, colon cells targeted by EI-tPA in vivo and
identify novel pathways by which EI-tPA elicits a favorable response in this model system. Collectively, the
studies proposed herein should further our understanding of the interface between hemostasis and immunity
and further efforts to mine the fibrinolysis system for novel anti-inflammatory drug development."

Over 1 million Americans undergo surgical treatment for a fracture each year. Despite advances in clinical
research over the past few decades, poor outcomes remain unacceptably common in this population. The
conventional clinical trial design remains slow, inefficient, and unmalleable to a changing clinical landscape.
Adaptive platform trials have emerged as a highly efficient alternative, enabling the simultaneous comparison
of multiple interventions under the same infrastructure and the addition of new interventions after trial initiation.
However, to realize these efficiency gains, substantial pre-trial planning is required. Our trial’s study population
will broadly include patients 65 years or older admitted with a fracture of the lower extremity, pelvis, or
acetabulum. We will focus on comparative effectiveness interventions and have a roster of comparisons ready
to launch once the platform is developed. The comparisons can apply to the entire study population or a
specific therapeutic domain, defined as a subpopulation for a decisional dilemma exists, and the interventions
will be compared (e.g., plate vs. IM nail in patients with a distal femur fracture). We will assess all comparisons
using the win ratio approach four months after randomization based on a common hierarchical composite
endpoint of death, ambulation status, and days at home. To successfully initiate this adaptive platform trial, we
propose an 18-month planning period. In that time, we will leverage our team’s experience designing,
implementing, and conducting multicenter trials in orthopaedics and adaptive trials in other areas of clinical
research. During the planning period, we will complete the following three specific aims: 1) perform computer
simulations to determine adaptation parameters, 2) establish stakeholder groups and structure for determining
the sequence of research comparisons and therapeutic domains, and 3) establish clinical trial infrastructure for
the platform."
10811070,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The reasons for persistent symptoms following a concussion, such as dizziness and imbalance, are not well
understood. While common perceptions attribute dizziness and imbalance after concussion to vestibular
problems, recent evidence points towards abnormal integration of sensory information, as measured by static
assessments (i.e., balance while standing), rather than peripheral sensory dysfunction. However, many
everyday tasks, like navigation, require dynamic central sensory integration of vestibular, visual, and
proprioceptive cues. The lack of knowledge of central sensory integration during dynamic activities leaves a
critical gap in understanding the consequences of concussion during daily life. Our central hypothesis is that
concussion alters central sensory integration required for dynamic mobility, including spatial updating and
control of balance. This exploratory proposal will begin to address the role of sensory integration in the
dynamic task of spatial updating, which is a process that is required for effective navigation and uses visual,
proprioceptive, and vestibular information to keep track of one’s location and orientation in space. Spatial
updating is a necessary component for forming an accurate cognitive map of the environment, which is crucial
for independent living. The proposed work will consider the overlap and potential interference between spatial
updating, a cognitive application of central sensory integration, and the control of balance, a motor application
of central sensory integration. The long-term goal of the work is to improve rehabilitative care for people with
persisting imbalance after concussion by directing patients to targeted treatments that improve their mobility
and navigation in daily life. As traditional rehabilitation for post-concussion imbalance focuses on sensory
integration for balance, we will use virtual reality to determine how concussion affects sensory integration
during spatial updating and how this integration relates to sensory integration for balance. In Specific Aim 1, we
will assess concussion-related differences in performance and sensory integration on an ambulatory VR spatial
updating task by varying visual and self-motion cues. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the association
between sensory integration for dynamic spatial updating and sensory integration for balance. In Specific Aim
3, we will test the extent of dual-task interference between spatial updating and dynamic balance. Overall, our
innovative study will use state-of-the-art technology (virtual reality) to assess central sensory integration during
a dynamic spatial updating task and then relate performance on that task to the ability to control balance.
Overall, the results of this study will open a new significant line of research that can use virtual reality as an
innovative and clinically-translatable assessment, and potentially future treatment, of sensory integration for
spatial updating and sensory integration for balance in clinical settings for people with persisting symptoms
after concussion."

 This Exploratory/Developmental Research Grant proposal seeks to advance the state of the art in
diagnostic ophthalmic imaging with a novel, robotically-aligned optical coherence tomography (OCT) system
capable of automatically measuring a retinal biomarker that cannot currently be identified with standard of care
OCT devices. Prevention of irreversible vision loss in leading retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (DR)
depends on identification of disease changes. While DR has historically been researched and treated as a
microvascular complication of diabetes, much less is understood regarding the changes in neurons and
photoreceptors in DR. Prior studies in animal models with induced diabetes have demonstrated atrophy in the
outer nuclear layer (ONL), which primarily consists of photoreceptor cell bodies. However, the lack of sufficient
data in humans means there is still not a widely accepted understanding of the role of photoreceptor loss in DR.
 OCT is a low coherence interferometric technique that has found widespread adoption in ophthalmology
for providing high-resolution, volumetric imaging of the retina. Quantifying changes in the ONL with OCT offers
a non-invasive method to follow and understand the course of the photoreceptor degeneration in DR described
above. However, conventional OCT systems are not able to discriminate the ONL from Henle’s Fiber Layer
(HFL). In order to visualize HFL and therefore isolate the ONL, the pupil entry position of the OCT sample beam
must be offset for each individual cross-sectional B-scan. To perform this process volumetrically would require
manual adjustment and a great deal of operator time and input.
 Our research group has pioneered the invention of a robotically-aligned OCT (RAOCT) system capable
of imaging both the anterior and posterior eye with active tracking to compensate for subject motion. Our RAOCT
system exhibits precise lateral, axial, and angular control of the sample beam and can perform autonomous
imaging of freestanding individuals. In the proposed project, we will leverage the micrometer-scale control of the
pupil entry position with RAOCT to develop a method for automatically acquiring retinal volumes that provide
complete visualization of HFL and the ONL, without the need for operator input.
 The expected outcome of this proposal is a set of technologies that will provide automated measurements
of a retinal biomarker that is otherwise unable to be measured with conventional methods. We expect that our
proposed RAOCT system will consistently provide reproducible ONL thickness measurements when accounting
for the obscured presence of HFL. We will also demonstrate our device in the clinic in patients with and without
diabetic retinopathy. We believe that our results will contribute to our understanding of photoreceptor changes
in DR and pave the way for future studies that investigate using ONL thickness measurements to monitor the
progression of leading retinal diseases."

Campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of bacterial foodborne diarrheal disease in the USA. The majority of
C. jejuni isolates express surface glycans mimicking human gangliosides that play a key role in triggering
Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) through formation of anti-ganglioside antibodies (Abs) that fix complement onto
human neurons and Schwann cells. Due to the commonality of C. jejuni infection worldwide, GBS has now
become the leading cause of paralysis since the near-eradication of polio. Patient treatment involves use of
intravenous immunoglobulin G (IVIg) intended to compete with these auto-antibodies, but up to one-third of
patients do not respond to this treatment. We hypothesize that specific IgGs exist in the B cell repertoire of
Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) patients that can be exploited for GBS therapeutic development. We will
screen B cells derived from former GBS patients for anti-ganglioside IgG expression using human Ab isolation
to identify IgG sequences linked with pathogenesis. These Abs will be tested in competition ELISAs and C. jejuni
serum bactericidal assays. The most effective Abs will be verified on human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived
Schwann cells and assessed on hPSC-derived myelinated peripheral neurons measuring electrical activity and
myelin complex disruption. Candidate IgGs will be transformed into therapeutic blocking Abs by Fc modification
and tested against the original Abs in our combined assays. The most effective blocking Abs will then be tested
on two IVIg-responder and two IVIg-non-responder patient induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons
in comparison to pooled immunoglobulins typically used for IVIg treatment. This study will identify therapeutic
blocking antibodies for the development of a targeted GBS treatment."

Care Pathways for Individuals with Histories of Exposure to Violence,” this R61/R33 project seeks to develop
and evaluate a brief video and text messaging intervention delivered in the emergency department (ED) to
prevent the onset or escalation of opioid use, misuse, or disorder among recent sexual assault (SA) survivors.
More than 1 in 4 women will experience an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime. PTSD and opioid
misuse are prevalent in the wake of sexual violence, and the opioid epidemic is having a unique impact on
women, with sharper increases in prescription opioid deaths, a greater likelihood of meeting criteria for opioid
use disorder (OUD), and increased likelihood of comorbid mental health conditions compared to men. ED visits
for sexual assault medical forensic exams (SAMFEs) have increased more than 1500% in the last two decades
and may provide an important opportunity to intervene to prevent the onset or escalation of PTSD and opioid
misuse and disorder. Our team developed and tested a brief video intervention delivered in the ED to women
presenting for a SAMFE in two randomized controlled trials. Compared to treatment as usual (TAU), the video
was associated with reductions in PTSD, depression, suicidality, alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine use for
subgroups of survivors when followed over 6 months. However, in our second RCT, an active control
mindfulness video better reduced post-SA opioid use compared to TAU for survivors with pre-SA opioid
misuse. Thus, we propose to develop a new video, Skills Training in Active Recovery (STAR) based on the
evidence-based principles of both videos to better address PTSD and opioid misuse. In the previous RCTs,
survivors reported substantial distress at the SAMFE; given that distress can impair memory encoding, we
propose to develop a 3-week daily text messaging program called TextSTAR that will reinforce content
presented in the video but give opportunities for survivors to engage with the material in a different setting and
over a longer period of time. During the R61, we propose to develop the STAR video and TextSTAR and get
feedback from a community advisory board of sexual assault survivors about the wording and presentation of
the content to maximize acceptability and utility. We will pilot test STAR and TextSTAR with a separate sample
of survivors (N = 50) recruited from 5 ED sites within the Better Tomorrow Network, a research network of
SAMFE programs throughout the US, to gather preliminary data about our recruitment approach, acceptability
of the intervention, and efficacy. In the R33, we will conduct a SMART trial where survivors will be randomized
to receive STAR or no video at the ED, assessed at 1 week, and those above threshold for acute stress/PTSD
or opioid use, misuse or disorder will be randomized to receive TextSTAR or no text intervention for 3 weeks.
We will re-assess PTSD and opioid misuse and disorder at 1, 3, and 6 months. If efficacious, this intervention
is a low-cost and easy-to-disseminate approach to reduce PTSD and opioid outcomes among SA survivors."
10812121,"The goal of this project is to develop smart targeted lipid ECO/siRNA nanoparticles (ELNP) to target
oncogenic long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as a novel therapy to treat triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC). Metastasis and drug resistance are the main causes for the high mortality rates of women
diagnosed with TNBC worldwide. Although targeted therapies have been developed to treat some
subtypes of breast cancer, the TNBC subtype is particularly refractory to these therapies. Oncogenic
lncRNAs play a critical role in tumorigenesis, metastasis, drug resistance, and immune suppression of
cancer by simultaneously manipulating multiple cancer-associated signaling pathways. We have
demonstrated in this project that onco-lncRNAs are promising therapeutic targets to treat TNBC, and
that downregulation of an onco-lncRNA with systemic delivery of targeted ECO/siRNA nanoparticles
results in significant suppression of TNBC proliferation. We have identified a novel lncRNA BORG,
which is associated with TNBC development, metastasis, drug resistance and immune invasion, as a
compelling therapeutic target to treat TNBC. It is overexpressed in invasive BC, including TNBC, but
not in normal tissues. Downregulation of BORG with targeted ECO/siRNA nanoparticles has potential
to inhibit metastasis, sensitize TNBC to chemotherapy, and enhance antitumor immunity for curative
treatment of TNBC. In this project, we will optimize and develop the smart ECO/siBORG nanoparticles
to efficiently deliver siBORG in TNBC to silence the cancer-promoting lncRNA. We will also explore
the combination therapy of silencing BORG with a tumor-specific peptide drug conjugate and/or
immunotherapy to treat TNBC and to eventually eradicate this deadly disease. The specific aims of
this project are 1) to optimize and develop smart siBORG-ELNP for efficient and specific gene
silencing in breast cancer cells; 2) to determine the efficacy of targeted siBORG-ELNP as single
therapy and in combination with targeted chemotherapy in animal TNBC models; and 3) to determine
the efficacy of targeted siBORG-ELNP in modulating TIME for improved immunotherapy in animal
TNBC models. Our long-term goal is to develop a novel and feasible therapy based on the smart
nanoparticles to treat life-threatening breast cancer."
10813705,"Enamel is the only epithelial derived tissue that mineralizes. It develops in an extracellular matrix secreted by
highly specialized epithelial cells, the ameloblasts, which synthesizes a host of specific matrix proteins with little
homology to any other known proteins. Amelogenin is by far the largest constituent of the developing enamel
matrix (DEM) comprising ~90% of all secreted protein. Amelogenin’s primary structure encodes a series of critical
functions of the DEM that ultimately allow for control over the uniaxial growth of apatite nanofibers and their
three-dimensional organization into a stiff, hard and fracture-resistant tissue optimized for mastication and
integration with the underlying dentin. Previously, we have demonstrated the biological significance of the
amyloid-like character of amelogenin which allows the protein to adopt ß-sheet structure and to self-assemble
into nanoribbons (Amel-NR) that guide the growth of mineral ribbons. Based on this data, a new model of enamel
biomineralization founded on the activation of the mineralization process by the enzymatic cleavage of
amelogenin by matrix metalloprotease-20 (MMP20) has been proposed and will be further evaluated in this
application. We have hitherto shown, that removal of the hydrophilic C-terminal domain allowed an acidic
polymer to interact with Amel-NRs thereby initiating the deposition of an amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP)
layer. Subsequently, ACP transformed into crystalline apatite in the form of ribbon-like mineral about 15-20 nm
wide that followed the morphology of the Amel-NRs. The sequential process of biomineralization observed in
our in vitro model correlates with biological events of tissue mineralization and reinforces emerging concepts of
biomineralization not only valid to enamel but other hard tissues. Such concepts include: a) biomineralization is
regulated by proteolysis; b) presence of a carrier-protein that acts as a process-directing agent and delivers
mineral ions to a self-assembled protein framework; c) carrier-protein interactions produce amorphous mineral
deposits onto the protein framework; d) the supramolecular structure of the organic phase directs the phase
transformation into defined crystal habits by oriented crystallization.
In continuation of previous studies, we propose to identify constituents of the DEM that are critical for the
templated growth of crystalline apatite nanofibers in association with the protein nanoribbons. By determining
the three-dimensional structure of Amel-NRs at near-atomic resolution, further functional domains will be
identified and associated with critical molecular and structural mechanisms in enamel formation. Ultimately, we
plan to use the unique ability of Amel-NRs to direct the fibrous growth of apatite and synthesize nanomaterials
through hierarchical design at the micro- and nanometer length scale."

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the 8th most common form of adult cancer in the US. Despite recent
improvement in treatment options, the majority of patients with metastatic RCC continue to succumb to this
disease, resulting in over 100,000 deaths per year worldwide. Thus, it is important to identify novel therapeutic
strategies to more effectively treat this deadly disease. My preliminary studies suggest that YAP/TAZ function
as master regulators of the core oncogenic transcriptional network and are required for maintaining the
transcriptional homeostasis of RCC tumors. The first major aim of my proposal is to determine the effects of
pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of YAP/TAZ on oncogenic transcription and super enhancer maintenance
in patient-derived primary RCC cells. I will employ cutting-edge epigenomic techniques including Cut&Tag and
QuantSeq to probe how genetic and pharmacological inhibition of YAP/TAZ affects the compositions and
activities of the YAP/TAZ transcriptional complexes and the global RCC epigenetic and transcriptional
landscape. Given the reported functions of YAP/TAZ in orchestrating phase-separated transcriptional
condensates at super enhancers, I will combine immunofluorescence analysis of endogenous YAP/TAZ and
other components of the YAP/TAZ transcriptional complexes, along with DNA fluorescent in situ hybridization
(DNA-FISH) against YAP/TAZ-bound enhancer regions, to investigate how genetic or pharmacological
inhibition of YAP/TAZ affects the formation of active transcriptional condensates at these particular genetic
elements and their necessity in regulating YAP/TAZ target genes. Through these analyses, I will be able to
gain critical insights into the molecular functions of YAP/TAZ in RCC tumors, but also reconstruct the core
ensemble of the RCC oncogenic transcriptional network. The second major aim of this proposal is to determine
how YAP/TAZ functionally interacts with hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF2A) and whether YAP/TAZ co-
inhibition can overcome resistance to HIF2A inhibitors in an in vivo model. While HIF2A inhibitors are in late
stage clinical trials, upfront and acquired resistance to this small molecule inhibitor is prevalent. My preliminary
findings suggest that YAP/TAZ signaling may contribute to resistance to HIF2A inhibitors. Using
pharmacological inhibitors of YAP/TAZ and HIF2A, I intend to use Cut&Tag and QuantSeq to investigate the
functional interactions between HIF2A and YAP/TAZ in maintaining clear cell RCC oncogenic transcription, as
well as possible YAP/TAZ regulated genes mediating resistance to HIF2A inhibitors. Furthermore, I will
investigate how YAP/TAZ inhibitors, in combination with HIF2A inhibitors, impact the in vivo growth of HIF2A-i-
resistant patient-derived ccRCC xenografts, performing QuantSeq on harvested tumors to validate my in vitro
findings. Together, these studies will greatly enhance our understanding of the crosstalk and redundancies
between the oncogenic pathways that govern the growth and survival of RCC cells, potentially yielding more
effective combination strategies to overcome treatment resistance in RCC patients."
10813709,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Using brain lesions and deep brain stimulation to identify an epilepsy circuit
Focal epilepsy is common in patients with brain lesions such as stroke, trauma, and tumors. Why some patients
with brain lesions develop epilepsy while others do not is unknown. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) offers new
therapeutic promise for patients with focal epilepsy, but seizure freedom is rare. Why some patients improve
after DBS while others do not is also unknown. Current dogma focuses on the lesion location or DBS site alone.
We hypothesize that connectivity of lesion locations and DBS sites to remote nodes distant from the lesion or
DBS sites itself can explain variance in lesional epilepsy and DBS response.
 New techniques developed by the Fox lab (PI) can identify remote nodes connected to lesions causing
and DBS sites treating brain diseases. These techniques combine the location of the lesion or stimulation site
with a normative atlas of human brain connectivity termed the connectome. As such, they do not require
connectivity data from the patients themselves and can be applied to almost any clinical lesion or DBS dataset.
This approach has successfully mapped circuits involved in parkinsonism, amnesia, depression, and over 20
other brain diseases. Moreover, identifying circuit nodes connected to both lesions causing and DBS sites
treating the disease can identify new or improved therapeutic targets.
 Our preliminary data in ischemic stroke suggests there is a common brain circuit involved in epilepsy.
Lesion locations that cause epilepsy (n = 76) are more connected to the cerebellum and basal ganglia (‘Ce-BG’)
compared to control lesions (n = 625). Connectivity of anterior thalamic DBS sites to these same circuit nodes
is correlated with seizure reduction after DBS (n=30). While epilepsy is often considered a cortical disease, these
subcortical Ce-BG nodes have previously been implicated in the modulation of seizures and cortical excitability.
Although promising, further work is needed to determine if these results generalize across lesion types (Aim 1,
n = 2,700), prospectively predict epilepsy risk (Aim 2, n = 6,000), and correlate with DBS response (Aim 3, n =
198). For each aim, we will focus on our Ce-BG nodes as an a priori hypothesis, but also perform data-driven
(unbiased whole-brain) analyses to minimize risk of false positives or negatives. We will perform all analyses
using a functional connectome (primary outcome) and structural connectome. Completion of these aims will
determine whether connectivity of lesion locations and DBS sites to a common set of subcortical nodes can
explain variance in lesional epilepsy and DBS response. Identifying this circuit could identify patients at high risk
for epilepsy, guide DBS programming, and serve as a target for future brain stimulation trials. Collectively, these
results could facilitate a shift in focus from the seizure-onset zone itself, which differs in every patient, to a brain
circuit that may represent a new therapeutic target for focal epilepsy."
10785367,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Nitrogen fixation by the metalloenzyme nitrogenase supports nearly 50% of the global
population and is the only biological pathway for nitrogen reduction. Nitrogenase consists of two proteins, the
obligate reductase Fe-protein and the catalytic MoFe-protein, both of which are rapidly inactivated by oxygen.
Biochemical, crystallographic, and spectroscopic studies have yielded seminal insights into the structures and
functions of purified nitrogenase proteins, but a unified understanding of the enzymatic mechanism is still
unrealized. These proteins are expressed in a small subset of prokaryotes termed diazotrophs, including aerobes
and anaerobes, which inhabit a diverse array of environments. Despite this evolutionary demonstration of
compatibility between nitrogen fixation and a variety of metabolisms, robust heterologous expression of the
nitrogenase proteins has not been achieved. Instead, endogenous expression within the free-living soil bacterium
Azotobacter vinelandii remains the most widely used system for the purification and study of nitrogenase. Several
peculiar features of this obligate aerobe have been annotated under nitrogen-limited conditions, to wit, the
formation of an intracytoplasmic membrane network, but a comprehensive investigation of these features and
their relationship to the nitrogenase proteins is lacking. The primary hypothesis of this proposal is that
interactions with cellular ultrastructures and as yet unidentified binding partners in vivo significantly
regulate and promote nitrogenase activity. My goal is to identify and characterize these states of nitrogenase
in diazotrophic organisms by training in and applying emerging cryoelectron tomography (cryoET) methodologies
and performing experiments outlined in two Aims. Aim 1: Revealing the architecture of the nitrogenase
interactome in A. vinelandii with mass spectrometry and single particle (SP) cryoEM. Aim 2: Determining in situ
structures of nitrogenase complexes in conjunction with cellular features using cryogenic correlative light and
electron microscopy (cryoCLEM/ET) and sub-tomogram averaging (STA). As a postdoctoral fellow I have gained
expertise in anaerobic SP cryoEM to obtain high resolution structures of nitrogenase. These skills will provide a
foundation for the proposed research. However, I seek training in the growing field of cryoET for the study of in
situ structures. Throughout the outlined aims, I will train in genetic manipulation of non-model organisms, mass
spectrometry, and cryoET from my advisory committee, the Caltech CryoEM and proteomic facilities, and
national facilities while continuing to expand my mastery of SP cryoEM and metalloenzyme chemistry. In my
independent career, I will apply this training to the continued study of nitrogenase and other anaerobic systems
relevant to environmental and human health. The proposed aims will yield the first comprehensive investigation
of nitrogenase in situ with the increasingly high resolution technique of cryoET, and will provide insight not only
into cellular regulation of nitrogen fixation, but also structures of true turnover states within the cell thus
fundamentally moving our understanding of this important biogeochemical process forward."

Career Goal: I am committed to a career as an independent research scientist contributing to the design,
implementation, and evaluation of interventions to improve sexual health among adolescents, and reduce
disparities in health outcomes. Career Development: This K99/R00 Award will provide an additional period of
mentored training to support my transition to an independent investigator by the end of the K99 phase. My
training objectives are to: (1) master methodological strategies for conducting formative research necessary for
health intervention adaptation and tailoring; (2) gain a proficient understanding of adolescent sexual minority
male (ASMM) health and sexual assertiveness training needs; (3) identify core principles and applications of
implementation science to successfully conduct a clinical trial with an effectiveness-implementation hybrid
design; and (4) develop skills and expertise to facilitate a successful transition into a fully independent research
scientist, including those needed to conduct randomized controlled trials of behavioral interventions. Research
Project: ASMM are at disproportionately high risk for acquiring HIV/STIs and report lower rates of condom use
compared to their heterosexual peers. Assertive sexual communication is associated with higher rates of
condom use among adolescents; however, ASMM do not receive adequate information or skills about sexual
assertiveness. The purpose of this research is to adapt an existing digital health intervention, originally
designed to provide a general population of teens with information about sexual consent, to include a focus on
condom negotiation and tailor content specifically for ASMM. The project has two Specific Aims: (1) adapt the
sexual consent intervention (PACT) to serve as skills-based sexual assertiveness and condom negotiation
training for ASMM; and (2) evaluate the adapted PACT intervention among ASMM in an effectiveness-
implementation hybrid design. Mentorship: I have assembled a dedicated mentoring team of experts to
provide ongoing guidance on my proposed research and training activities. This team includes a primary
mentor (Dr. Eric Walsh-Buhi, Department of Applied Health Science, Indiana University School of Public
Health-Bloomington [IU SPH-B]), a secondary mentor (Dr. Kathryn Macapagal, Department of Medical Social
Sciences, Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine), and a panel of scientific advisors in the
Department of Applied Health Science at IU SPH-B (Drs. Kristen Jozkowski, Karla Galaviz, and Debby
Herbenick). Future Directions: Skills and data acquired from this proposal will support a future R01 proposal
to conduct further trials of PACT."

This R21/R33 application is to develop our proprietary chemically ligated guide RNA (lgRNA)-based
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology for therapeutic elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) covalently closed
circular DNA (cccDNA) and cure of chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Prior studies have already demonstrated in
hepatocyte cultures and in mice models that HBV cccDNA can be successfully edited by several clustered
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) gene editing technologies. Apparently,
achievement of CHB cure requires elimination and/or inactivation of the vast majority of cccDNA, if not all, in
the liver to allow the ultimate clearance or immune control of residual HBV infection. However, due to the
relatively low in vivo editing efficiency, multiple doses of current candidate CRISPR/Cas therapeutics under
preclinical development are most likely required for significant reduction of cccDNA pool in the liver, which
may be limited by the immunogenicity of the CRISPR ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes and of their delivery
vehicles, such as adeno-associated viruses (AAV). To improve the gene editing efficiency, accuracy and
durability, we are focusing on the chemical optimization of guide RNA. Particularly, for robust, convergent,
and scalable chemical synthesis and chemical modification of guide RNA, instead to synthesize a full-length
single guide RNA (sgRNA), the guide RNA was synthesized through ligation of two or three short RNA
segments via non-phosphoramidite chemistry, i.e., chemically ligated guide RNA (lgRNA). This new
technology not only makes the manufacture of long RNAs cost-effective but also gives access to high-quality
validated full-length products with much fewer synthetic errors at the critical spacer segment than classic
sgRNA. Obviously, it enables cost-effective global chemical modifications for better efficacy, selectivity and
stability as well as targeted delivery by molecular tagging and various formulation technologies. Thus far, we
have already developed state-of-the-art chemical methods for the synthesis of lgRNAs that support efficient
cleavage of target DNA in vitro by Cas9 and edit HBV cccDNA as well as integrated HBV DNA in human
hepatoma cells supporting HBV replication and gene expression. In R21 phase, we will further chemically
optimize lgRNA and identify at least three lgRNAs that can efficiently edit cccDNA in human hepatoma cells.
In R33 phase, Cas9 mRNA and lgRNA will be co-formulated into lipid nanoparticles (LNP) and their efficiency
on cccDNA editing and viral gene expression will be evaluated in HBV infected hepatoma cells and primary
human hepatocytes. The therapeutic efficacy and durability of optimized Cas9 mRNA-lgRNA LNP on HBV
infection will be evaluated in HBV infected FRG-human hepatocyte chimeric mice model, alone or in
combination with a HBV DNA polymerase inhibitor. Successful completion of the proposed work should well
position the candidate therapeutics for further preclinical/clinical development for treatment of CHB."
10785992,"Abstract
 Immunotherapy is a promising therapeutic strategy for many cancers. Anti-tumor immune responses are
elicited against neoantigens that arise from genetic alterations within tumor cells that give rise to a repertoire of
peptides that the immune system recognizes as non-self and attack, killing the tumor cells harboring them.
Cancers with a high mutational load generally benefit from immune checkpoint therapy, but some solid
malignancies, like pancreatic cancer, have a low mutational burden that hampers immunotherapy. One strategy
to overcome this limitation is to deliver exogenous neoantigens to cancer cells. Here we propose an approach
that uses the tumor penetrating peptide iRGD, to deliver neoantigens to pancreatic tumors. Unlike conventional
RGD peptides, iRGD, is not only able to target and the tumor vasculature through αv integrin, but also to
extravasate and penetrate tumor tissue via neuropilin-1 delivering conjugated or co-administered drugs or
peptides. Pancreatic cancer long term survivors often have neoantigens that mimic common viral epitopes,
suggesting the possibility that these individuals benefited from an immune response against neoantigens that
mimic viral components. We posit that iRGD-mediated delivery of these antigens to pancreatic tumors will
redirect pre-existing antiviral immunity against them. For this purpose, we will use peptides activating
cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific T cells. CMV is a β-herpesvirus infects >60% of the population and elicits a
strong immune response accounting for >10% of all circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells.
 Our preliminary data show that mice latently infected with CMV containing orthotopic pancreatic tumors
respond to treatment with iRGD plus CMV peptides with tumor regression associated to increased necrosis, and
marked T cell infiltration. Here we propose experiments to determine in an orthotopic pancreatic tumor mouse
model, what are the best neoantigens and the optimal treatment conditions for achieving long lasting tumor
regression (Aim 1). We will also assess the presence of CMV specific T cells in human pancreatic tumors, a
necessary step toward the eventual translatability of this approach (Aim 2)."
10789898,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Our goal is to improve skeletal muscle growth and body composition in the fetus, neonate, and adult affected by
intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Fetal skeletal muscle growth is profoundly limited as a result of placental
insufficiency and leads to lifelong reductions in muscle mass (sarcopenia) and metabolic disease risk, making
restoration of muscle mass during the perinatal period a high priority. During the previous project period, we
found multiple defects in fetal skeletal muscle growth in a highly relevant sheep model of IUGR, including lower
muscle protein synthesis (MPS) rates, lower muscle mass relative to brain and whole-body weights, smaller
myofibers with lower myonuclear number, and fewer total myofibers compared to normally-growing controls.
Based on our preliminary data, we have identified adaptations within branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)
catabolism that result in lower MPS in the IUGR fetus. Weight-specific BCAA uptake rates by the IUGR hindlimb
are reduced despite normal circulating BCAA concentrations, the likely result of lower Na+K+-ATPase activity to
drive BCAA into the myocyte. Branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT) protein expression is higher, which is
the first step in BCAA catabolism and results in de novo alanine and glutamine synthesis to support
gluconeogenesis, anapleurosis, and energy production. Despite our recent progress, however, critical
knowledge gaps remain regarding the mechanisms by which placental insufficiency programs the IUGR myocyte
to reduce BCAA uptake and increase BCAA catabolism. Furthermore, it is not known when during an IUGR
gestation these mechanisms become intrinsic to the myocyte or how they may be prevented and/or reversed to
improve muscle growth. We have assembled a research team of highly qualified experts in metabolism and
state-of-the-art metabolomic and proteomic techniques to fill these knowledge gaps. We will test the hypothesis
that lower Na+K+-ATPase and higher BCAT activity are intrinsic to the fetal myocyte to increase BCAA catabolism
and limit MPS by the end of an IUGR gestation, but that a targeted therapy (L-alanyl-L-glutamine, AG) delivered
during a critical developmental window will ameliorate these defects to increase MPS. In Aim 1, we will determine
the cellular mechanisms that reduce MPS and test the extent to which these adaptations are intrinsic to the
myocyte and/or induced by extrinsic circulating factors the IUGR fetus. In Aim 2, we will address when MPS
becomes limited during the course of an IUGR pregnancy. This information is critical to inform the timing of
therapies during pregnancy aimed to increase fetal growth. In Aim 3, we will test the capacity of an AG infusion
into the IUGR fetus to activate Na+K+-ATPase, stimulate BCAA uptake, and reverse BCAA catabolism to increase
intramuscular BCAA for MPS. In summary, this proposal will address gaps in knowledge about how BCAA
utilization is regulated in the fetus exposed to placental insufficiency when myofibers are forming, myonuclei are
accreting, and hypertrophy rates are some of the highest during the lifespan. These studies are a necessary
prerequisite for designing novel approaches to restore muscle growth."

Candidate background: Dr. Glazer received a B.S. from MIT in biology and a Ph.D. from the
University of California-Berkeley in evolutionary genetics. As a postdoctoral fellow in Dan Roden's lab
at Vanderbilt, he has developed high-throughput methods for studying cardiac ion channels. He has
also begun in vitro studies of candidate disease variants discovered through biobank genetics.
Research strategy: Thousands of rare Variants of Unknown Significance (VUS) exist in Mendelian
disease genes. To improve the accuracy and impact of genomic medicine, the field must develop
efficient, scalable methods for identifying variant associations with disease and testing these variants
in vitro. This proposal focuses on cell surface transmembrane proteins, which comprise ~20% of the
proteome and are associated with many Mendelian diseases. Aim 1 will use genetic discovery in a
large biobank to identify new disease-variant associations, using a method to aggregate multi-organ
phenotypes called the Phenotype Risk Score (PheRS). PheRS scores will be refined and validated for
~50 candidate transmembrane gene-disease pairs. These scores will be deployed in BioVU,
Vanderbilt's biobank (recently expanded to >100,000 genotyped individuals), and other cohorts.
Variants will be tested for association with PheRS scores to discover high-priority variants statistically
linked with disease. Aim 2 will test the in vitro function of high-priority transmembrane variants using a
mixture of gene-specific and general assays. These studies will begin with 4 variants statistically
associated with Mendelian diseases by PheRS scores, but still classified as a VUS. This approach
will be expanded to test in vitro function of additional variants discovered in Aim 1. Aim 3 will develop
and validate Surface-seq, a general method for comprehensively measuring the cell surface
trafficking of nearly every variant in a transmembrane protein. This method will first be optimized on a
small gene, KCNE1, which is associated with arrhythmias and deafness. It will then be extended to
larger transmembrane genes, including BMPR2, a gene linked to pulmonary hypertension. Overall,
this work has the potential to identify many new pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in
transmembrane genes. Variants will be reclassified with data from Aims 1-3, and the classifications
will be published and deposited into the ClinVar database.
Career development and training: This proposal takes advantage of the applicant's expertise in
genetics, genomics, and high-throughput assays. It includes many new training opportunities with the
Roden and Denny groups and other collaborators, especially involving biobank genetics and new
methods for studying transmembrane genes. The additional training will help lead to the candidate's
goal of establishing an independent lab studying genomic medicine and transmembrane proteins."

Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, leading to the
pathogenic expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. The key pathological features include
striatal medium spiny neuronal loss, and the presence of cellular inclusion bodies containing mutant HTT
proteins. There is no disease-modifying treatment for HD. The recent failure of the clinical trial of HTT reduction
approaches indicates the urgent need for development of novel therapeutic modalities. Neuroinflammation has
implications in HD pathogenesis. HD human tissue and mouse models demonstrate activated microglia and
astrocytes and elevated levels of plasma cytokines and chemokines, all potentially contributing to HD pathology.
Inflammasomes are key components of the innate immune response, whose formation is triggered by
substances produced through infections, tissue damage, or other disorders. Inflammasome activation has
implications in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Our pilot studies found that HTT interacts with NLRP3
and activates NLRP3-inflammasome, and that knockdown of NLRP3 protects against mHTT-induced
neurodegeneration in cultured human striatal neurons. These results suggest that HTT/NLRP3-linked
inflammasome pathways may play a critical role in HD pathogenesis. Thus, we propose to test the hypothesis
that mutant HTT interacts with and activates the NLRP3-inflammasome in neurons, thereby resulting in
neurodegeneration and HD pathology, and thus that NLRP3 could be a therapeutic target via 3 aims. Aim 1. We
will characterize the interaction of HTT and NLRP3. Aim 2. We will assess whether mutant HTT activates the
NLRP3-inflammasome in neurons, leading to neurodegeneration. Aim 3. We will evaluate whether
downregulation of the HTT/NLRP3-inflammasome pathway as a novel treatment strategy in HD mouse models.
These studies will elucidate the roles of mHTT and NLRP3 interactions in activation of the inflammasome
pathway and determine how this contributes to the neurodegeneration underlying HD pathogenesis. Our results
may provide novel drug targets and therapeutic strategies for future HD interventions, and may also implicate a
shared mechanism of inflammasome activation for other neuroinflammation-related neurological disorders."

Immune coreceptors play an important role in tuning adaptive T cell responses. Inhibitory receptors have
emerged as a target for immune therapy because of their ability to dampen protective immunity in cancers,
chronic inflammation, or chronic viral infection. Lymphocyte activation gene-3 (Lag3) is a CD4-like surface co-
receptor expressed on the surface of activated lymphocytes. MHCII molecule is the most well characterized
Lag3 binding ligand. Lag3-MHCII binding during CD4 T-APC interaction has been shown to inhibit optimal T cell
activation. Blocking the interaction with anti-Lag3 antibody or loss-of-function mutant Lag3 renders the T cells to
hyper-proliferate and to produce more IL-2. Lag3 has thus emerged as an important immune checkpoint
molecule and a potential therapeutic target to reinvigorate anti-tumor immunity. Besides conventional T cells,
Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), a central regulator of immunity and tolerance, are also known to express high
level of Lag3. Many studies demonstrated that Lag3 expression on Tregs is necessary for optimal Treg
suppressive function, although there has been a controversial finding that Lag3 instead limits adequate Treg
function to control autoimmune diabetes. The precise cellular and molecular mechanisms by which Lag3 controls
Treg functions remain largely unknown. During the previous funding period, we uncovered that IL-27 signaling
in Tregs is critical for Treg functions to suppress chronic inflammation. We also found that IL-27 induces Lag3
expression in Tregs. By transferring Tregs deficient in Lag3 function, we demonstrated that Lag3 is necessary
for Tregs to mitigate chronic autoimmune and allergic inflammation. The overarching goal of this renewal
application is to investigate the mechanisms by which Lag3 controls Treg function. We generated novel mouse
models in which Lag3 extracellular Ig domain necessary for the function, Lag3 cytoplasmic domain, or Lag3
KIEELE motif is selectively deleted in Tregs and found that the loss-of-function mutation or loss-of-intracellular
signal in Tregs drastically impairs Tregs’ ability to suppress autoimmune neuroinflammation. The central
hypothesis is that Tregs control inflammatory responses via the Lag3-induced intracellular pathways and that
Lag3 regulates Treg metabolic activity. Two specific aims are proposed. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the role
of Lag3 in Treg function to control autoimmune inflammation. Specific Aim 2 will investigate the molecular
mechanisms by which Lag3 regulates Treg metabolism and functions. Successful completion of the study will
not only broaden our understanding Lag3 biology but also identify novel therapeutic strategies targeting Lag3
and its downstream signaling pathways."

The overall objective of this study is to refine newly developed Optical Coherence Tomography-based
imaging technology to investigate the role of cilia in the fallopian tube in vivo.
 Ciliopathies in women are associated with fertility disorders and ectopic pregnancies. Ciliated epithelial cells
lining the lumen of the fallopian tube (oviduct) are known to play an essential role in reproduction. However,
these very dynamic and complex reproductive processes have not been directly observed in vivo (yet), and the
environment of the female reproductive tract is too complex to model. In particular, the dynamics of the fallopian
tube cilia, their coordinated function, and their contribution to infertility are poorly understood, limiting the
development of infertility treatments and assisted reproductive technology (ART). Here, we propose the first live
dynamic investigation of cilia function in the mouse fallopian tube and the effect of ciliopathy on reproductive
function. To do so, we will integrate technology development in functional optical coherence tomography (OCT),
unique intravital imaging methods we recently established, and the mouse model of human ciliopathy with a
fertility defect. This proposal will introduce a novel measure of coordinated ciliary dynamics, build a
comprehensive visual understanding of the ciliary role in reproductive processes, and produce the first functional
analysis of reproductive failures in a mouse model of ciliopathy toward a better understanding of the ciliopathy
link to infertility.
 New methods developed in this study for dynamic cilia analysis can potentially be directly adapted for
diagnostic purposes in clinics, and novel scientific findings in mice could be corroborated in humans, making a
significant impact.
 Scientific Premise, Scientific Rigor, and Relevant Biological Variables: This proposal is clinically
relevant and aims to fill a significant gap in the field of reproductive biology through highly innovative live imaging
methods which we develop. Solid preliminary data and rigorous validations support all proposed experiments.
“Sex as a biological variable” does not apply to our study design. Extensive details and references to our
published protocols are provided to ensure that preliminary and proposed experiments can be replicated in other
laboratories."
10797107,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Pregnancy is a physiological state of continuous and significant adaptation to changing maternal and fetal
nutritional needs ensuring successful completion of pregnancy at term. To this end, as pregnancy progresses,
the placenta produces multiple hormones that participate in modifying maternal metabolism to meet the
metabolic needs of both fetus and mother. Of the placental hormones, circulating kisspeptin1 (Kiss1) levels
progressively increase by several-hundred-fold during pregnancy. Although certain metabolic actions have been
assigned to Kiss1, little is known about how Kiss1 contributes to the metabolic adaptations of pregnancy.
 In addition to developing insulin resistance, maternal hepatic glucose output (rate of appearance) increases
as does the propensity to developing hypoglycemia and ketosis even after short periods of fasting. The
mechanism underlying the tendency of the pregnant female to develop ketosis remains unknown. Further,
insufficient glucose and nutrient supply to the fetus poses a significant health risk for the developing child.
 Based on our preliminary studies, we hypothesize that during gestation placenta-derived circulating Kiss1,
activates its cognate G-protein coupled receptor Kiss1R on hepatocytes and signals via Gaq-inositol
triphosphate receptors (IP3R) to activate AMPK (adenosine-monophosphate dependent kinase), lipolysis and
ketogenesis. Absence of Kiss1R in hepatocytes of female mice during pregnancy leads to excessive lipid
accumulation in maternal hepatocytes and to increased risk of hypoglycemia in the third trimester.
 Furthermore, our preliminary studies indicate that the pancreatic hormone glucagon stimulates hepatic Kiss1
production, whereby Kiss1 acts in the liver in an autocrine manner. Absent liver Kiss1R, glucagon-induced IP3
production as well as hepatic glucose output are blunted in fasting mice, suggesting that kisspeptin induction is
an integral part of glucagon action in hepatocytes. These observations reveal a novel regulatory interplay
between glucagon and Kiss1 in regulating hepatic metabolic pathways.
 We now seek to expand our novel and exciting findings specifically a) to understand the molecular
mechanisms that shape maternal liver metabolism in gestation; b) to understand different Kiss1R-IP3R signaling
pathways in regulating liver metabolism, and c) to understand the role of glucagon-stimulated kisspeptin
production by the liver in modulating liver metabolism during gluconeogenesis.
 We will use complementary in vivo and in vitro approaches to elucidate these important signaling pathways
in hepatocytes using newly generated unique mouse models as well as in vitro in human hepatocyte cell lines.
 Our studies will yield important insights into kisspeptin’s role in liver metabolism during eutherian pregnancy
and into how kisspeptin and glucagon signaling interplay in hepatocytes to regulate metabolism. Further, our
studies will dissect signaling pathways as potential therapeutic targets in metabolic liver disease and diabetes
mellitus."

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the causative agent of a growing proportion of incident cases of head and neck
squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). HPV type 16 is responsible for over 90% of HPV+ HNSCCs diagnosed
in the United States. The HPV16 E7 antigen is an attractive immunotherapeutic target for HPV-associated
cancers since it is a unique virus-specific oncoprotein constitutively expressed by all cancer cells. T cells that
are genetically engineered to express an HLA-A*0201-restricted T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes the
HPV16 E711-19 epitope can mediate regression of HPV16-associated cancers in a preclinical model.1 A phase 1,
first-in-human (FIH) multi-center study demonstrated the safety and efficacy of an autologous HPV TCR-
engineered T cell (TCR-T) therapy which targets the HPV16 E7 binding epitope in HLA-A*0201-expressing HPV+
cancer patients (NCT03912831).2 However, the realized challenges with adoptive cell therapy (ACT) are: i) the
high costs associated with manufacturability and monitoring and managing the toxicities from the supra-
physiological bolus of ACT products which are combined with systemic IL-2 administration, and ii) the limited in
vivo persistence due to the lack of appropriate antigen-specific stimulation due to poor intra-tumoral T cell
recruitment into solid tumors. Herein, we propose innovative proof-of-concept (PoC) experiments to determine
whether a low dose of adoptively transferred HPV16 E711-19 TCR-T cells can be exponentially expanded in situ
by administering a novel biologic fusion protein, CUE-101, which delivers the HPV16 E7 antigen-specific
stimulation with localized delivery of high doses of IL-2.3-5 Furthermore, we determine whether HPV16 E7 TCR-
T cell persistence translates into an enhanced anti-tumor effect in preclinical HPV+ tumor models (Aim 1). Lastly,
we build upon our team’s discovery of the role of the CXCR6:CXCL16 axis in the recruitment of peripheral
circulating CD8+ T cells to perivascular niches of the tumor populated by CXCL16-expressing CCR7+ DC3s,
which can sustain the survival of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells.6 Thus, we assess whether the efficacy of HPV16
E7 TCR-T cells can be improved through engineering strategies that introduce CXCR6 to the TCR-T cells, which
can facilitate intra-tumoral recruitment, proliferation, and survival in situ (Aim 2). The completion of these aims
will generate the supporting rationale for a future clinical trial administering HPV16 E7 TCR-T cells and CUE-
101 in HPV+ cancer patients. These efforts can potentially transform our current approaches to adoptive cell
therapy."

Stroke is a major public health problem in the United States, where it is the 5th leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability. There is great need for translational and clinical research to develop interventions that prevent, treat, or enhance recovery after stroke. However, clinical trials require significant infrastructure, and the time and energy required to assemble this infrastructure for individual trials is a major barrier to progress. The NINDS Stroke Net was established in 2013 (we joined in 2018) as a national stroke trials infrastructure, designed to maximize efficiencies by centralizing regulatory and contractual agreements. With a single National Clinical Coordinating Center (NCC), a single National Data Management Center (DMC), and 29 Regional Coordinating Centers (RCCs) throughout the US, Stroke Net was established to efficiently recruit patients for stroke trials. The existing Stroke Net RCC28 Mid-America Regional Coordinating Center (MARCC) at Washington University School of Medicine (WU) and affiliated Barnes-Jewish Hospital (BJH), in collaboration with five other high-volume tertiary care Stroke Centers spans the Midwestern and Southern states of MO, KS, IL, TN, AR: St. Luke’s Hospital in Kansas City, MO; The Order of St. Francis Medical Center (OSF) in Peoria, IL; University of Tennessee Health Sciences in Memphis, TN; Cox Medical Center in Springfield, MO; and the University of Missouri in Colombia, MO. While not heavily represented in NIH clinical trials, these states have some of the highest stroke prevalence in the US. Missouri is ranked 19th in stroke mortality, Tennessee ranked 8th, Mississippi ranks 1st, Illinois 15th and Kansas 27th among all states according to 2020 CDC data. Since our last submission in 2018, the Mid-America Regional Coordinating Center (MARCC) at Washington University School of Medicine (WU) and affiliated Barnes-Jewish Hospital (BJH), has grown through enhanced attrition of low performing sites and addition of new sites including a large academic hub and five satellite high-volume tertiary care Stroke Centers. Each center has been carefully selected to serve as a tertiary care hub with large networks of referring hospitals, and has extensive experience in multi-center stroke trials. We consider MARCC a “Network of Networks”. Drawing from both rural and urban settings, the hospitals of MARCC admit over 7,500 stroke patients per year, including patients from diverse racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. Moreover, the MARCC collective group of stroke clinicians, investigators, coordinators, and scientists has successfully conducted Stroke Net trials, ranking 4th in overall Stroke Net Subject Enrollment from 2018-23 and ranking 4th in overall enrollment of Black Americans. We propose that MARCC will continue to perform as one of Stroke Net’s highest performing RCCs with the following specific aims: Aim 1. To maintain a seamless multi-state stroke trials infrastructure—the Mid-America Regional Coordinating Center (MARCC). Aim 2. To lead NINDS Stroke Net enrollment of patients from diverse racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. Aim 3. To recruit and train future clinician-scientists in stroke research through fellowship training and career enhancement."

Bariatric surgery is increasingly used to treat severe obesity and related comorbidities. However, clinical practice
guidelines now recognize associated skeletal consequences, as mounting evidence implicates surgical weight
loss in the onset of skeletal fragility. To address this, the randomized controlled trial, Strategies to Reduce the
Onset of Sleeve Gastrectomy Associated Bone Loss (STRONG BONES; U01AR080969) is testing if the
bisphosphonate, risedronate (a first-line osteoporosis drug), can effectively counter bone loss secondary to the
most common bariatric surgical procedure, sleeve gastrectomy (SG). This trial is randomizing 120 SG patients
(ages≥40) to 6 months of risedronate or placebo treatment, and assessing skeletal changes via dual energy x-
ray absorptiometry (DXA), computed tomography (CT), and blood-based biomarkers at baseline, 6, and 12
months; yet, these modalities are not sufficient to measure bone microstructure changes that are expected with
surgical weight loss and bisphosphonate treatment. The proposed ancillary study leverages the patient cohort,
infrastructure, and data of the parent STRONG BONES trial, and enhances its scientific value by adding high-
resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) imaging to assess interventional effects on
bone microarchitecture, density, and strength of the tibia and radius. HRpQCT is the only in vivo image modality
with sufficient resolution (61µm) to assess trabecular and cortical microarchitecture. Using longitudinal HRpQCT
imaging and micro-finite element (microFE) analysis of bone strength, we can pinpoint local areas of dynamic
bone formation or resorption and examine the mechanoregulation of this bone remodeling. The ancillary study
will add HRpQCT measures of the STRONG BONES participants, with four HRpQCT scans (distal tibia and radius;
diaphyseal tibia and radius) per visit (baseline, 6 and 12 months). Building on the parent trial, this ancillary study
is a timely, efficient, and cost-effective means to definitively test the scientific premise that risedronate can
attenuate deterioration of bone microarchitecture, density, and strength secondary to SG. Specific Aims are to:
(1) Determine the effect of risedronate vs. placebo on 12-month change in microFE-derived bone strength (failure
load) of the tibia and radius following SG. (2) Determine the effect of risedronate following SG on 12-month
change in HRpQCT-acquired trabecular and cortical bone mineral density and microarchitecture (e.g., trabecular
number, spacing; cortex thickness, porosity). (3) Investigate the localized remodeling and mechanoregulation of
bone in the microenvironment, and the associations of HRpQCT metrics with other skeletal outcomes obtained
in the parent study [DXA, CT, and bone turnover/tissue-crosstalk biomarkers] to elucidate biological mechanisms
underlying SG-associated bone loss and potential counteractant effects of risedronate. Definitive data supporting
use of an existing, cost-effective, and safe medication to offset rapid degradation of bone microstructure after
SG has the potential to shift current clinical practice paradigms, and offer mechanistic insight on the biology of
SG-associated bone loss and risedronate as a treatment option to counteract microstructural tissue damage."

Sex is an important biological variable as it has dramatic impacts on health and disease. Males have a greater
risk for infection and severe outcomes, while females have increased incidence of autoimmunity. This is often
attributed to sex differences in the immune system, as females have higher numbers of activated T cells with
more potent cytotoxic activity than males. Despite these differences, biomedical research has historically used
males only and many studies still do not stratify for sex. As a result, the biology underlying sex differences in
disease is poorly understood. As many discovered pathways in diseases may only be relevant to one sex, this
results in new therapeutics that are not always appropriate for both sexes. Thus, the need to understand the
major driving mechanisms for sex differences in immunity is urgent. Metabolism is a major biological factor with
significant sex differences. At the systemic level, there are fundamental metabolic differences between the
sexes, such as in fuel utilization, lipid metabolism in liver and adipose, and core body temperature. Cellular
metabolism is heavily influenced by systemic metabolism, yet little is known about sex-specific immune cell
metabolism. Cellular metabolism dictates the fate and function of immune cells as it powers all immune cell
functions but also metabolites act as signaling molecules and building blocks for effector molecules. Thus, we
hypothesize that there are sex differences in immune cell metabolism, which may be related to sex
differences in systemic metabolism, and these in turn influence disease outcome. Further, such
differences are likely driven by sex hormones and/or chromosomes. The specific aims to address this
hypothesis are 1) to assess sex differences in T cell function and metabolism and 2) to investigate the
contribution of sex hormones versus sex chromosome complement to these putative differences in the context
of viral infection. Key metabolic pathways that have sexually dimorphic expression in CD8+ and CD4+ T cells
will be uncovered via imaging, untargeted metabolomics, flow cytometry and Seahorse following T cell specific
or viral-induced activation in vivo. To study the mechanism behind sex-biasing factors modulating T cell
metabolism we will use the sex-reversed “four core genotype” mouse model and sex hormone receptor knockout
mice. These proposed studies will provide a mechanistic basis of sex differences in T cell metabolism following
activation and during viral infection. Understanding fundamental sex differences in T cell metabolism and the
sex-biasing factors that modulate them will provide a basis for future sex-specific therapeutics. My research
passion for the last 5 years has been to study sex differences. Now, this F31 training plan, coupled with the
research plan and the support of my Sponsor in the invigorating and collaborative research environment at
Harvard, will prepare me for my longer-term goal of an independent academic career combining the field of
immunometabolism and sex differences."

Corneal blindness is one of the leading causes of vision loss worldwide, with 10 million individuals having bilateral
corneal blindness globally. Allogeneic corneal transplantation (CT) to treat genetic and acquired corneal blindness is the
most common form of tissue transplantation worldwide, annually accounting for >50,000 surgeries in the United States
and ~180,000 globally. In high-risk CT, which accounts for >20% of the 180,000 transplants performed worldwide
annually, all grafts are rejected within 10 years of CT, despite the current standard of care, topical and systemic
immunosuppressive agents which have dose-limiting adverse side-effects including vision loss. Bedrock Therapeutics’
goal is the clinical translation of our single dose ex vivo adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy approach of the
corneal donor tissue to shield it from the host’s immune response. Phase I STTR Milestones were successfully achieved;
a novel lead candidate (BDRK-401) that demonstrates immunosuppression and anti-vascularization functions was
selected and a protocol for efficient corneal graft gene transfer was optimized towards feasibility of application in a
hospital setting. Furthermore, corneal grafts treated with AAV-BDRK-401 prior to high-risk CT were completely
protected from acute immunological rejection in a rabbit model. The objective of this Phase II proposal is to advance
the clinical development of BDRK-401 for prevention of CT rejection in humans by receiving FDA guidance, large scale
AAV-BDRK-401 manufacturing, and by performing a long-term safety and efficacy study. Successful completion of these
goals will generate a BDRK-401 data portfolio sufficient for IND application submission and, optimistically, attract
significant investment for GMP AAV-BDRK-401 production and the execution of a Phase I/II clinical trial. While
Bedrock’s initial focus is on preventing high-risk corneal transplant rejection, our novel immunomodulatory technology
is a single drug also applicable to other ocular and non-ocular diseases including the prevention of rejection in any solid
organ transplantation, wet age-related macular degeneration, and type 1 diabetes."
10821018,"SUMMARY
The extraordinary functional range of the mature CNS requires synchronized activity of neural circuits. Formation
of such circuits involves the timely specification and correct positioning of neural progenitors, and disruptions to
this process are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Hence, a key goal of developmental
neurobiology is to understand the control of neural progenitor specification in space and time in embryogenesis.
 One mechanism for proper spatiotemporal formation of neural progenitors involves morphogen gradients
that specify distinct progenitor types at different positions. While we know that morphogens do induce
different progenitor types at different positions, we do not understand how individual cells interpret
morphogen signals, nor how they convert this information into distinct cell identities. An informative
example of CNS morphogen action is the developing hindbrain, where retinoic acid (RA) and fibroblast growth
factor (Fgf) control formation of neural compartments (rhombomeres) – each of which represents a unique
progenitor population. However, we do not understand the distinct genetic programs that define individual
rhombomeres, nor how they arise from the earlier hindbrain primordium. Filling these knowledge gaps is
essential, but a profound barrier has been the lack of comprehensive molecular data for individual
progenitors as they undergo specification in response to morphogen signals. We overcame this barrier
by applying scMultiome analysis – which combines RNAseq and ATACseq of individual nuclei – to several stages
of hindbrain development. At the earliest stage, we detect three populations (a.k.a., PHPDs) containing
progenitors with mixed rhombomere (r) identities representing r2/r3, r4 and r5/r6 and we find that these
PHPDs form in response to RA and Fgf. At later stages, our analyses – for the first time – molecularly resolve
all rhombomeres and define their unique gene regulatory networks (GRNs). These advances now allow us
to address several key questions: How do progenitor cells respond to morphogens? How are the mixed
progenitor identities resolved into individual rhombomere identities? How are unique GRNs formed in each
developing rhombomere? We will answer these questions in the context of our hypothesis that morphogens act
via specific cis-regulatory elements to induce mixed identity GRNs in the PHPDs, and these are
subsequently resolved via repressive genetic interactions into rhombomere-specific GRNs that specify
unique progenitor types.
 Our project will delineate how morphogens control genetic programs for positioning and specification of
neural progenitors in the hindbrain. Since morphogens control neural specification throughout the developing
CNS, our findings will be broadly applicable to normal brain development, to modeling of neurodevelopmental
disorders, and to the implementation of restorative or replacement strategies as clinical treatments."

Congenital heart defects are present in 1.8% of newborns and account for one third of congenital defects. Despite
all the research that has been done, 80% of cases have no identifiable causes. Biomechanical factors are known
to regulate cardiac development, but the lack of methods to analyze flow in live embryos limits progress in
biomechanical studies. Mouse models have revealed much about cardiovascular development, but
biomechanical studies are extremely limited as imaging motion in embryonic hearts requires high speed, spatial
resolution, and imaging depth. Our lab’s recent advancements in optical coherence tomography (OCT) uniquely
meet these requirements for live embryo imaging through the heart, but quantitative flow tracking remains
inadequate despite the critical importance of blood flow. This project aims to develop a novel optical coherence
tomography (OCT) based method for volumetric, dynamic, and quantitative analysis of blood flow based on the
hypothesis that temporal spatial analysis of pixel fluctuation in OCT images over multiple cardiac cycles can
reveal quantitative measures of blood flow. In this cross disciplinary project, I will combine live mouse embryo
dissection and culture, optimize a custom operation protocol for our lab’s house-built OCT system, and develop
quantitative approaches for OCT image processing. This method will be applied to build the first 4D (volume +
time) map of early mouse embryonic blood flow and will set a platform for functional cardiovascular phenotyping.
Structural OCT imaging will be performed on cultured mouse embryos on embryonic day 8.5 (E8.5) volumetrically
and heartbeats aligned based on previously established methods. The proposed flow speed analysis will be
based on the duration each pixel detects a particle, particle size statistics, optical microangiography, and the
periodicity of the cardiac cycle. Doppler OCT in regions of defined orientation will be used as calibration and
validation. The proposed quantitative OCT angiography approach for blood flow analysis in the early mouse
embryonic cardiovascular system will be applied to build the first 4D quantitative cardiac flow pattern in early
embryos. Implementation of this approach in existing mouse models of congenital heart defects will provide
insight into the interplay between genetic and biomechanical factors in cardiac development and disease,
contributing to better diagnostics, prevention, and early treatment of human congenital heart disease.
 Through this fellowship, I will master unique cross-disciplinary skills ranging from mouse embryo dissection,
custom-built imaging systems, quantitative approaches for OCT image processing, and cardiodynamic
development analysis. I will train with experts in development, optics, computation, and cardiovascular biology
to advance my scientific career at the frontier of cardiovascular biomechanics."

Inflammation and ulceration of mucosal tissue, called mucositis, is a severe side effect of many common
treatments in oncology, including chemo- and radiotherapy. Mucositis development is costly to the health care
system and can lead to poorer outcomes for patients. Mucositis of the mouth and esophagus, called oral
mucositis, is particularly common in head and neck cancer patients receiving radiation therapy, where roughly
80% of patients develop this side effect. Treating oral mucositis remains a large clinical unmet need with no FDA
approved treatments. Using Sinopia Biosciences’ computational platform, we identified a target class and an
associated small molecule for preventing and/or treating mucositis. The target class has an established safety
profile in patients with solid tumors. In two studies with the acute radiation-induced hamster model of oral
mucositis, we observed compelling results that oral administration of the compound significantly decreased the
duration of ulcerative mucositis and in some animals completely prevented the development of ulcers. The
observed effect size was as large or larger than other compounds currently in the clinic tested in the same model.
The test compound is a pan-inhibitor of several targets in the target class, each with multiple binding domains.
In Phase I, we identified the specific domain within this target class that most safely contributes to mucositis
amelioration. Selective inhibition of this domain retains the efficacy of the pan-inhibitor, but avoids the general
toxicity issues seen with pan-inhibition. In this Phase II proposal, we will develop a novel orally bioavailable
compound that selectively inhibits this specific target domain. We will then characterize this new compound in
the fractionated radiation model of oral mucositis mucositis to advance the program towards the clinic."

Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient for nearly all eukaryotic organisms. Cells must maintain a careful Cu
homeostasis to balance cellular needs while minimizing toxicity due to excess Cu accumulation. Fungi, such as
Candida albicans, must acquire, route, store, use, and continually monitor levels of Cu to thrive in human hosts.
To survive as a human pathogen, C. albicans must be able to withstand the manipulation of Cu metal
concentrations at the host-pathogen interface, forcing the fungi to rely on complicated Cu homeostasis pathways
to adapt to Cu-replete and Cu-depleted environments. Although commonly used as a treatment, fluconazole is
fungistatic, merely inhibiting growth of C. albicans and increasing the risk of developing resistant strains.
Fluconazole induces a Cu-deficient response in C. albicans, despite an increase in total Cu levels compared to
untreated cells. The Cu-deficient response includes the induction of the Cu-import gene CTR1, repression of the
Cu exporter CRP1, and a switch in expression of cytosolic superoxide dismutase from CuZnSod1 to MnSod3,
controlled by the transcription factor Mac1. Mac1 is regulated by Cu levels in the cell, binding Cu ions under Cu-
replete conditions and binding DNA under Cu-deficient conditions. Despite understanding the metalloproteins
involved in the Cu-deficient response, there are still numerous gaps in our understanding of the response. It is
known that Mac1 must lose its Cu ions to bind DNA; however, the molecular basis for activation, including the
discrete entity involved, is unknown. The work described within this proposal seeks to further illuminate our
understanding of the Cu-deficient pathway of Cu homeostasis in C. albicans by investigating the role of
CuZnSod1. CuZnSod1 has been primarily characterized its role as global antioxidant, removing reactive oxygen
species; however, there are novel roles proposed for Sod1 in sensing the Cu levels of the cell and participating
in the Cu homeostasis response by directly activating Mac1. Here, I aim to probe the location and metalation
state of CuZnSod1 under fluconazole-induced Cu-deficient conditions and characterize the conditions for a direct
interaction between CuZnSod1 and Mac1, using biophysical techniques. Collectively, this work will allow us
further insight into the Cu-deficient homeostasis mechanisms of C. albicans and will allow us in the long-term to
apply this understanding to design more effective antifungal treatments exploiting metal-specific weakness to
increase potency and decrease changes of developing resistant strains."

The purpose of this Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Individual Pre-Doctoral
Fellowship in Nursing Research (F31) application is to provide research training for Ms. Frazier, a third-year
doctoral student at the University of Washington School of Nursing. The long-term goal of this training is for
this applicant to develop into an independent nurse scientist in a research-intensive academic setting with a
program of research dedicated to interventions that integrate biological and socioecological factors to reduce
and ameliorate symptom burden in individuals living with atrial fibrillation (AF). As the U.S. population ages, the
number of individuals with AF is rapidly increasing, with cases projected to more than double by 2030. Most
individuals with AF experience bothersome and at times debilitating symptoms that significantly impair quality
of life (QOL). Women with AF bear the burden of more frequent and severe AF symptoms and lower QOL.
While prior studies have consistently identified gender differences in AF symptom and QOL outcomes, the
multilevel factors contributing to such differences in women and men are largely understudied. The applicant
proposes a cross-sectional study (N=124) that employs both quantitative (Aims 1 and 2) and qualitative (Aim 3)
methods to elucidate social factors and novel biological markers that contribute to differences in AF symptoms
and QOL in women and men with AF. The specific aims are to: 1) Compare epicardial adipose tissue volume,
adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), AF symptoms, and QOL between women and men with AF; 2) Examine
for associations linked to potential intermediating pathways between epicardial adipose tissue volume,
adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), AF symptoms, and QOL for women and men with AF; and 3) Explore
perceptions of social factors (social support, living situation, and social network interactions) and their influence
on AF symptoms and QOL for women and men with AF. Through advanced coursework and direct research
experience, qualitative and quantitative methods, focused analysis of gender and social contexts in AF, and
discovery of highly relevant links among biological markers of and AF-related outcomes, this award will provide
a firm foundation for the long-term goal to develop behavioral interventions and upstream solutions to improve
symptom experiences and QOL in women and men with AF."

The overarching goal of this project is to identify tissue-specific genetic variants and genes that
are associated with cellular and tissue morphology in normal tissues. We plan to apply advanced
computational pathology methods based on machine learning and computer vision to analyze
normal tissue histology H&E images from Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), extracting
interpretable image features as quantitative traits. Next, we will apply bioinformatic and statistical
genetic methods to identify the morphological traits that are correlated with eQTLs in donor
population, thus generate image QTLs (a.k.a. imQTLs) for all normal tissue types in GTEx with
over 100 samples. In addition, we will apply advanced functionally informed GWAS (FiGWAS),
which has been successfully applied to eQTL research and significantly boosted the detection of
rare variants in genomic association study, to further investigate the association of non-eQTL
genetic variants with the interpretable quantitative morphology features described above and to
generate supplementary imQTLs. Neither of these two approaches has previously been applied
to identify imQTLs. The workflow will initially focus on cell type morphological features, then
expand to features related to tissue development and cell-cell interactions. The identified imQTLs
(or the genes/image traits associated with them) will be further tested in histopathological images
in corresponding tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for any difference in terms of
imQTL presence, abnormality in the associated image traits, or expression in the associated
genes. The identified imQTLs will not only generate new insights about the tissue differentiation,
development, and morphological variations in the normal population, but also will provide a solid
basis for comparing pathological changes in many types of diseases and help quantify the level
of the corresponding histopathological changes. The resulted image features and imQTLs will be
made available through a web portal called PathoGenome Viewer for general public query and
use."

and cardiometabolic complications. The specific aims will: 1) assess the contribution of asymptomatic CMV
replication to soluble markers of microbial translocation and vascular dysfunction in treated HIV infection, 2)
assess the degree to which treated HIV infection is associated with inflammatory CMV-specific CD8+ T cell
infiltration of adipose tissue and insulin resistance, and 3) assess whether maturational defects in CMV-specific
CD8+ T cells occur in treated HIV infection. These studies will also serve as ideal POR training platforms for
his mentees."
10809038,"Neurofibrillary tangles, composed of intracellular aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein are by far the
most correlated pathology with clinical symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD). Emerging evidence suggests
that extracellular vesicles (EVs), such as exosomes and microvesicles, transfer pathological tau protein
between cells as vehicles, and propagate tau pathology in different brain regions. It is urgently important to
find the molecular basis of brain-derived EV, which critically regulates the transport and uptake of pathogenic
tau protein between neuronal cells and aggregation of tau protein in recipient neurons.
 The purpose of the current application is to delineate the effect of P2RX7, a purinergic receptor, on EV-
mediated tau propagation. Our preliminary data have shown that suppressing microglial EV secretion by GSK
1482160 compound, a specific inhibitor of the P2RX7, dramatically reduces tau aggregation in CA1 and CA3
pyramidal neuronal cells and dentate granular cells with P301S tauopathy animal model. Interestingly this
coalesces with reduction of exosome-specific ‘endosomal sorting complexes required for transport’ (ESCRT)
EV marker, TSG101, in the same hippocampal regions, suggesting the possible EV trafficking from microglia
to hippocampal neurons, which may transfer and seeds misfolded tau and accelerate protein aggregation in
receiving neurons. Thus, those data indicate the regulatory mechanism by P2RX7 on EV mediated tau
propagation and posit the therapeutic potential of the P2RX7 inhibitor for AD or other tauopathy. We
hypothesize that P2RX7 critically regulates the transfer of EVs between microglia and neurons in the
hippocampal neurons, thereby facilitate spreading misfolded tau. We will validate the effect of
GSK1482160 on tau propagation by recapitulating those findings using P2rx7 deletion in P301S tau mice and
adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based tau propagation mouse model.
 In Aim 1, we will determine the effect of systemic deletion of P2rx7 in P301S mouse. The distribution of
EV markers and tau pathology in the hippocampal regions will be evaluated and compared with the findings
from GSK1482160-administered P301S mice. In Aim 2, we will determine the effect of P2RX7 on secretion
and transfer of EV and EV-associated tau and its aggregation potency in vitro. This will determine which cell
type is particularly responsible for P2RX7 regulated tau spread into hippocampal neurons. In Aim 3, we will
confirm the cell type, which is selected in Aim 2, for the export of EVs into hippocampal neurons by cell type-
specific deletion of P2rx7 or Tsg101, an exosome synthesis molecule, and validate if P2RX7-mediated EV
secretion are responsible for tau propagation using AAV-based tau propagation mouse model. Successful
completion of this study will enhance our understanding of molecules that mediates secretion of EVs from glia
to neurons in vitro and in vivo, and identify novel targets for AD."

There is a well-known gap between what we know can optimize health and healthcare and what
happens in everyday practice. Implementation science (ImS) holds promise for generating new
knowledge to close this gap. ImS is especially important for addressing health inequities which
result, in part, from failure to deliver evidence-based practices to marginalized and minoritized
racial and ethnic groups. Implementation science (ImS) is a branch of research that focuses on
the “use of strategies to adopt and integrate evidence-based health interventions and change
practice patterns within specific settings.”1 Appropriate training of junior faculty from
underrepresented minority (URM) backgrounds in ImS may uniquely position them to pursue
innovative research of interest to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and to
launch successful careers as independent investigators. The UCSF Research in Implementation
Science for Equity (RISE) program is an innovative research and career development program
grounded in social cognitive career theory that integrates mentoring and targeted social support
with concrete knowledge and skill building. In particular, RISE has provided didactic training,
research experiences, and on-going research mentoring in ImS for URM junior faculty focused on
cardiovascular or pulmonary research, leveraging the considerable expertise in ImS training at
UCSF. These research skills building activities focused on ImS are paired with an innovative
career development program that includes critical activities of importance for this career stage
(including manuscript and grant writing). The training program is led and delivered by successful,
NIH-funded investigators and other outstanding researchers in cardiovascular and pulmonary
diseases at UCSF, and by former RISE scholars. Through this unique combination, RISE and
RISE-2 have provided 75 URM junior faculty with tangible methodological and academic skills to
enhance their own research and compete successfully for NIH resources, while also developing
a strong network of junior faculty conducting research of relevance to the NHLBI. The proposed
RISE-3 builds on the success of RISE and RISE-2 and will add several new components: 1)
expansion of the ImS program curriculum to include content on how to link ImS and health equity
frameworks for designing interventions, collecting data, and assessing outcomes; 2) additional
CIP (Careers in Progress) sessions in the monthly longitudinal curriculum; 3) enhanced
opportunities for peer support, mentoring, and networking, including connecting RISE-3 scholars
to established ImS investigators and to the robust RISE alumni network."

Dr. Brady Post’s long-term goal is to explain how system-level integration affects quality and equity, specifically
for rural residents. The American health care system has moved quickly toward greater integration between
hospitals and physicians. As a way to organize healthcare services, hospital-physician integration has
generated much controversy within the health policy community. Advocates hope for more efficiency and care
coordination while skeptics raise concerns over costs and quality. This pressing policy issue, poised to be a
defining issue in health care for decades to come, requires dedicated scholars. Dr. Brady Post has focused his
scholarship on this topic since his doctoral studies at the University of Michigan and he continues to build the
evidence base as an Assistant Professor at Northeastern University. A natural next step in his career is to
advance the science on hospital-physician integration using a more sophisticated set of methodological
approaches that will round out his skillset and, simultaneously, help to fill persistent gaps in the literature.
Through a comprehensive training plan that includes formal coursework and mentored, project-based learning,
this project will equip Dr. Post with (1) deep knowledge of rural health needs, policy, and service delivery (2)
qualitative and mixed-methods techniques, and (3) survey design and measurement theory needed for survey
research. This unique combination will position Dr. Post to direct innovative studies of how hospital-physician
integration reshapes health care in rural communities. This training will build his skills as an independent
researcher and prepare him to successfully compete for R01-level grants. This project will examine the effects
of hospital-physician integration on care coordination, patient access to care, and disparities in health
outcomes across rural and urban areas. It will leverage rich survey data to highlight patients’ perspectives and
use in-depth interviews to highlight physicians’ and mangers’ perspectives. With this award, Dr. Post will bring
new concepts and new approaches to the literature on hospital-physician integration at a time when the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Federal Trade Commission, and other policymakers are
actively weighing the benefits and drawbacks of increased integration. This proposal directly answers AHRQ’s
request for health services research to advance health equity (NOT-HS-21-014) and focuses on the AHRQ
priority population of rural residents. This award will support Dr. Post’s transition to independence, establishing
him as a leading scholar on the quality and equity implications of increasingly integrated health care systems."
10807366,"Cognitive dysfunction is a highly prevalent feature of depression that is resistant to anti-depressant treatments
and associated with a worse course and outcome. Although a broad range of cognitive deficits are observed in
depression, it is psychomotor speed and executive function that are most severely impacted during a
depressive episode. A mechanistic understanding of why cognitive deficits emerge in depression is needed to
identify treatment targets. Activated inflammatory physiology - a process in which TNF signaling is critical -
plays a causal role in a substantial proportion of depressed cases based on genetic, clinical, experimental and
observational research. In contrast, evidence that inflammation causes cognitive dysfunction, particularly in the
context of depression, is less clearly established. Both theory and observational data, however, indicate that
inflammation may account for deficits in psychomotor speed and executive function during a depressive
episode. Determining how inflammation relates to cognitive dysfunction in depression is complicated by
notable methodological limitations. First, the nature of the associations between inflammation, depression, and
cognition is difficult to characterize because multiple, overlapping confounds exist (e.g., stress). Second,
cognition is typically assessed intermittently (months/years apart) due to a reliance on in-person, lengthy
cognitive measures that lack (“real-time”) temporal sensitivity. To overcome these limitations, this K23
application proposes using an intensive sampling methodology within a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to
determine whether administration of an anti-inflammatory agent that inhibits tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
signaling improves psychomotor speed and executive function in depressed individuals exhibiting an
inflammatory phenotype over two weeks; exploratory analyses will examine whether decreases in inflammatory
biomarkers are associated with improvements in cognition. Advances in cognitive neuroscience will be
leveraged to assess cognition daily and generate sophisticated estimates of cognitive performance that
address known limitations in conventional indices. A TNF antagonist was selected because of its critical role in
inflammation, known association with psychomotor speed and executive function and because clinical trials
have shown that a TNF antagonist (infliximab) can reduce depressive symptoms and increase effortful
motivation after two weeks in depressed individuals exhibiting an inflammatory phenotype. The applicant
proposes training in the: conduct of experiment research that is well-equipped to determine causality (i.e.
RCT); use of intensive sampling methodologies in clinical samples; use of remote cognitive assessment tools
and sophisticated analytic approaches; and further training in immunology. An interdisciplinary team of
scientists will provide expert mentorship within the highly resourced environment of the Massachusetts General
Hospital. The proposed study will advance the candidate’s long-term career goal of developing a mechanistic
understanding of cognitive dysfunction in depression and accelerate the transition to research independence."

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), recently renamed metabolic dysfunction associated fatty liver
disease (MAFLD), is a worldwide public health problem. Despite major investments by the pharmaceutical
industry, there are no approved drugs for the treatment of MAFLD, reflecting the heterogeneous
pathophysiology of this disease. We have implemented a platform focused on a human vascularized liver
acinus microphysiology system (vLAMPS) biomimetic that incorporates four human liver cell types and uses
genomic, biochemical, and phenotypic metrics, and quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) to identify
mechanisms of disease progression that can be used to inform new or repurposed drugs for MAFLD. Genome-
wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several variants that are associated with MAFLD
susceptibility, including mutations in PNPLA3, TM6SF2, and MBOAT7. In contrast to these variants that
increase MAFLD risk, recent studies have identified two novel protective variants, HSD17B13 and MTARC1,
that are linked to lower risk of MAFLD. However, little is currently known regarding the biological function of
these protective variants. Thus, our goal is to harness the computational and experimental QSP platform with
genome-edited iPSC-derived liver cells to experimentally test probe drugs and drug combinations predicted by
computational analysis to normalize key disease phenotypes and to provide mechanistic insight into the role
novel protective variants have in both alleviating MAFLD progression and as attractive new pharmacological
targets; thus, linking specific genetic variant risk factors with successful intervention on druggable pathways.
We will test the following Specific Aims: (1) Implement optimized biomimetic vLAMPS to recapitulate both
normal liver function and MAFLD disease progression using iPSC-derived liver cells harboring clinically
relevant variants (2); Test the response to drugs predicted to halt or reverse MAFLD disease phenotypes using
iPSC-derived high-risk variants in vLAMPS; (3) Test the response to drugs predicted to halt or reverse MAFLD
disease phenotypes using iPSC-derived high-risk variants in vLAMPS.
The lack of approved drugs for treatment of MAFLD is due to the heterogenous pathology of disease
progression and the limitation that animal models do not fully recapitulate the human disease. The use of a
combined QSP and iPSC-derived MPS experimental platform to examine mechanistic detail of key disease-
related genetic variants and to use for testing predicted drugs serves as a starting point to identify optimized
therapeutics that will advance the approach to MAFLD drug discovery."
10797328,"Project Summary/Abstract
Current research activities in the laboratory of the Nominee concentrate on repetitive mild traumatic brain injury
rmTBI), Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses (GWVI), and substance abuse disorders (SUD). Each of these conditions
has in common damage to the brain. These conditions can also interact and serve as a co-morbid condition for
the others. These illnesses are over-represented in Veterans and represent serious health concerns for them
and their families. There are no effective therapies for rmTBI, GWVI and SUD. The overarching goal of this
research program is to achieve a better mechanistic understanding of rmTBI, GWVI and SUD so that
evidence-based therapies can be developed which will restore and return brain function in Veterans with these
disorders. rmTBI is a complex and chronic condition that has remained untouched by therapeutic interventions.
Despite numerous treatment successes in animal models, all clinical trials of TBI therapies in humans have
failed to date. This situation can be attributed to inappropriate animal models, at least in part. This project will
use a new mouse model of rmTBI that closely mimics the human condition insofar as symptoms and
pathologies in brain develop very slowly. Treatments directed at arresting increased glial reactivity will be
started after head impacts have been completed in order to maintain a translational approach. GWVI is another
chronic condition in Veterans of the Gulf War and this condition is characterized by three main symptom
clusters- gastrointestinal disorders (like IBD), chronic fatigue, and anxiety/PTSD-like conditions. Perhaps the
largest obstacle to achieving better treatments for GWVI is the fact that the toxins to which military personnel
were exposed are not known (dose, length of exposure, combinations). This project recognizes that all three of
the major symptoms of GWVI can be traced one-by-one to an altered gut microbiome. It also recognizes that
any toxins to which military personnel were exposed have been eliminated from their bodies soon after they
redeployed home. Therefore, we hypothesize that lifestyle risk factors, common among Veterans (e.g., obesity,
smoking, alcohol abuse), all of which can also disrupt the gut microbiome, interact with these exposures to
accentuate and prolong symptom expression. Research on this project will therefore target the gut with
therapies intended to correct the gut microbiome disruption that results from GWVI-lifestyle interactions (e.g.,
probiotics, short chain fatty acids, microbiota-accessible carbohydrate and/or low-fat diets). A second phase of
this project will develop a humanized mouse model of GWVI by transferring the diseased gut microbiome from
Veteran donors into mice and examining the mice for symptoms of the human disorder. This project bypasses
the uncertainly regarding toxin exposure in GWVI and will incorporate an important complicating factor in this
disorder- human GWVI shows much more symptom variability than the mouse model. This individualized
medicine approach will then target specific treatments aimed at symptom reduction. Finally, it is emerging that
Veterans with rmTBI and GWVI are at risk for co-morbid SUDs. This project will therefore examine opiate use
in models of rmTBI and GWVI using oxycodone self-administration. Oxycodone is the most abused
prescription drug worldwide and has become infamous in the opioid overdose epidemic. New research in our
lab has shown that oxycodone self-administration causes significant disruptions in the gut microbiome.
Therefore, we will extend the rmTBI and GWVI projects to incorporate tests of oxycodone abuse. It is
hypothesized that animals with rmTBI and GWVI will self-administer significantly greater amounts of
oxycodone and cause further disruptions of the gut microbiome. Attempts to rebalance the gut microbiome in
these conditions will be tested as therapies. These studies have been made possible by generous support
from VA-funded instrument grants."
10797342,"Insulin resistance is a major cause of type 2 diabetes (T2D), heart attacks, strokes and cancer. These chronic
metabolic diseases disproportionately affect veterans, especially black veterans. Targeting insulin resistance by
treating obesity is effective but the major clinical options, low calorie diets or bariatric surgery, are difficult to
sustain and scale for the over 40% of veterans afflicted with obesity. Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), specifically
target insulin resistance and have proven clinically effective in preventing T2D, heart attacks and strokes, but
serious side effects have limited their clinical use. New therapeutic targets to treat insulin resistance are
needed. In theory, ‘omics’ approaches such as genome wide association studies (GWAS) of surrogate
measures of insulin resistance or mining the transcriptomic response caused by weight loss/ TZD treatment
could provide a source of novel target genes, but both approaches have limitations including identifying
specific genes/mechanisms for GWAS and distinguishing correlation from causation in gene expression
studies. Importantly, existing GWAS studies contain predominantly European samples and thus bias against
genetic discovery in African ancestry individuals. Ultimately, the dozens to hundreds of genes nominated by
‘omics’ approaches must be sifted by functional investigation for biological mechanism and therapeutic
translation. Even when a potential insulin sensitizing effector gene is validated in the lab, credentialing its
relevance to human insulin sensitivity necessitates drug development and human trials, another poorly
scalable process that usually results in failure for lack of efficacy. However, the recent accumulation of genome
sequences in large, clinically characterized populations has revealed that nature has performed countless
human trials in the form of millions of naturally occurring, protein-altering genetic variants scattered throughout
almost every gene in the genome. High-throughput functional assays are the key to unlocking these
opportunities: 1) identifying novel candidate genes for insulin resistance and 2) leveraging nature’s clinical trials
for assessing therapeutic potential. In this application, we propose to utilize a newly developed massively
parallel adipocyte differentiation/ lipid accumulation assay in an integrative genomic approach to:
Aim 1: Systematically identify novel insulin resistance genes incorporating African ancestry specific genetic
discovery in the VA population and
Aim 2: Determine the clinical effect of novel insulin resistance genes on metabolic disease in humans using
data from 488,000 sequenced individuals.
This work will identify novel insulin sensitivity genes relevant to the VA population and include African
ancestry-specific genes. It will also provide critical information on the human, clinical consequence of
modulating function of selected genes to enable therapeutic translation."
10799518,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As the second most common neurological emergency, status epilepticus (SE) is a group of life-threatening
conditions that are characterized by hypersynchronous epileptic activity that lasts for five minutes or longer
without full return of consciousness, and the overall SE-associated mortality rate in adults is about 20-30%.
The generalized convulsive SE constitutes about 45-74% of all cases and has long been known to trigger
neuronal damage, and patients who survive SE can develop long-term neurological sequelae. As such, SE
triggers changes in the brain that can lead to lifelong epilepsy and overall increases the risk of epilepsy by
more than three times compared to non-SE seizures. Despite an increasing list of US FDA-approved
antiseizure drugs (ASDs), about 23-43% of SE patients will progress to refractory SE and do not satisfactorily
respond to current medications, and the mortality rates in these patients can approach up to 39%. Current
ASDs are also well known for their broad neurotoxic adverse effects that are often unbearable and can further
complicate the management of seizures. It is another unfortunate fact that these medications only provide
symptomatic relief and have not been shown to prevent the development of epilepsy after de novo SE or
modify the progression of seizures. Development of the prevention and/or modification strategies for post-SE
epilepsy must hinge on a good understanding of signaling pathways that are provoked by SE and in turn
trigger epileptogenic processes, such as brain cytokine surge, reactive gliosis, neuronal damage, blood-brain
barrier disruption, and brain infiltration of leukocytes and blood proteins, which eventually accumulate in the
occurrence of unprovoked seizures, i.e., chronic epilepsy. Previous studies by us and others show that the
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor EP2 plays essential roles in brain inflammation, neuronal damage, and
behavioral deficits after SE in rodents. Our results from the previous grant cycle also reveal that Gαs-coupled
EP2 regulates microglial activation to release cytokines via its downstream effector – exchange protein
activated by cAMP (EPAC), and the SE-upregulated EPAC in turn contributes to neuroinflammation. Objective
of this proposed study is to reveal the molecular and cellular mechanisms whereby PGE2/EP2/EPAC axis
triggers these neuroinflammatory processes after SE and thus contributes to acquired epilepsy and behavioral
comorbidities. To achieve this goal, we will use multiple in vitro (aim 1) and in vivo (aims 2 and 3) models
engaging a unique set of genetic and pharmacological approaches that we developed during the previous
funding cycle. Completion of this study will provide novel insights into the regulation of neuroinflammatory
processes in the epileptogenesis after de novo SE, which should be also relevant to epilepsies triggered by
other brain insults, such as strokes, TBIs, brain infections and tumors, owing to the shared commonalities in
epileptogenic processes. If successful, this work will have identified new targets for disease modification and/or
prevention of epilepsy and could guide the drug development for novel antiepileptogenic pharmacotherapies."

Understanding the factors related to for whom and why evidence-based human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine
implementation strategies are effective and sustainable will inform the development of tailored or
complementary strategies aimed to increase health equity. Rates of HPV vaccination among adolescents in
the United States continue to remain below recommendations. Florida adolescents are particularly vulnerable
due to the state’s rank of 4th for HPV-related cancer diagnoses, but 46th for HPV vaccine initiation (≥1 dose)
and 47th for up-to-date rates (2 doses when first dose < 15 years; 3 doses when first dose ≥ 15 years). Despite
evidence of HPV vaccination disparities by geography and social determinants of health (SDOH), most HPV
vaccination implementation strategies have employed universal methods or tailored education material by
vaccine concerns and ignored the potential influence of key SDOH-related differences. Text & Talk is a 30-
clinic pragmatic trial in Florida assessing the effectiveness of two HPV vaccine implementation strategies:
(a) provider-targeted recommendation training encouraging providers to use a C-LEAR – Counsel, Listen,
Empathize, Answer, and Recommend – approach and (b) parent-targeted text messages. Text & Talk has 58
participating providers (37 trained during the study period and 21 to be trained after data collection) and 7,837
11- to 12-year-olds randomized for their parents to receive text messages about the HPV vaccine. The goal of
this proposal is to understand the factors related to for whom and why the Text & Talk implementation
strategies were effective and sustainable. For the provider-targeted training, the hypothesis is that providers
will have different experiences with implementing and sustaining C-LEAR in their practice that will guide
improvement and refinement of future trainings. For the parent-targeted text messages, text message
effectiveness is hypothesized to be differentially moderated by parental and neighborhood SDOH. Specific
aims are to: (1) Evaluate providers’ experiences with and sustainability of integrating C-LEAR into their
practice; and (2) Measure moderation of the effectiveness of a parent-targeted text message intervention on
increasing HPV vaccination by social vulnerability themes. Hypotheses will be evaluated by triangulating data
collected in Text & Talk with additional data collected during the extension period via mixed methods including
in-depth, semi-structured provider interviews, provider behavioral surveys about intent to sustain and continue
the use of C-LEAR, and spatially linking adolescent addresses to SDOH measures at census block group. The
innovations are a more in-depth focus on provider learning than previous studies and expanding existing
understanding of HPV vaccine reminder/recall moderation from primarily demographic variables to parent
factors and well-established, multicomponent risk scores measuring neighborhood-level SDOH. The
significance lies in the potential to improve the effectiveness, equity, and sustainability of HPV-related cancer
prevention implementation strategies."

 144 million children suffer from undernutrition, a condition with numerous long co-morbidities. A delay in
growth, including stunting of height and wasting of weight, is one of the most prominent morbidities of
undernutrition. While current therapeutics against undernutrition have reduced mortality, they have had very
limited efficacy in repairing the associated morbidities. Recent studies have indicated that undernutrition is also
associated with failed gut microbiota development, resulting in undernourished children having an immature gut
microbiota. Research efforts in mice have shown that transplanting immature gut microbial communities
transmits the growth faltering phenotypes seen in undernourished children. Repair of microbiota immaturity could
represent a new therapeutic strategy for treating childhood growth delays caused by undernutrition.
 To investigate whether more mature gut microbiota could rescue this delayed growth, the Gordon Lab
designed a series of microbiota-directed complementary foods (MDCF) that were able to repair microbiota
immaturity. Recently, we performed a proof-of-concept controlled feeding trial where undernourished
Bangladeshi children consumed either our most promising MDCF (MDCF-2) or a ‘standard’ ready-to-use
supplementary food (RUSF) not designed to repair microbiota immaturity. MDCF-2 produced a significantly
greater rate of weight gain than RUSF even though MDCF-2 has a lower caloric density than RUSF. This study
also revealed 23 bacterial strains whose abundance in the gut was associated with host weight changes.
Recently, it was also shown that MDCF-2 has a different set of carbohydrates compared to RUSF. These very
encouraging results provide the motivation for this proposal which seeks to better understand the genomic
features of these weight-associated taxa and uncover the mechanisms by which they respond to MDCF-2.
 Given that the gut microbiota plays a key role in processing of dietary polysaccharides and that
differences in carbohydrate-associated enzymes (CAZymes) gene repertoires are known to affect bacterial
fitness, I hypothesize MDCF-2 promotes host weight gain through the presence of specific bioactive
carbohydrates that are metabolized by CAZymes in growth-promoting members of the developing microbiota.
The goal of this proposal is to identify these putative weight-promoting CAZymes first in silico and then validating
those CAZymes in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 1, I seek to computationally identify CAZymes associated with weight
gain, characterize the genomes of their ‘host’ bacterial strains, and characterize their expression in the gut. In
Aim 2, I will directly test whether bacterial strains containing these CAZymes promote weight gain in gnotobiotic
mice fed a diet supplemented with MDCF-2. This effort to identify specific microbes containing growth-promoting
CAZymes will allow us to develop effective therapeutic foods in different populations of undernourished children
and expand our understanding of the mechanisms by which the microbiome influences postnatal development."
10800767,"A central modern tenet of atherosclerosis is that inflammation is a key driver of the process, and likely provides
at least a partial explanation for the excess CVD risk observed even after optimal treatment of traditional risk
factors. There is a critical unmet need for imaging tools that accurately risk stratify atherosclerotic patients based
on their inflammatory phenotype and identify those where a given therapy is indicated and then monitor its effect.
The monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 / C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (MCP-1/CCR2) axis is of particular
interest due to its central role in recruitment of pro-inflammatory monocytes which through their conversion of
pro-inflammatory macrophages are crucial for early atherosclerotic lesion formation and its progression. We
have developed a copper-64 radiolabeled extracellular loop 1 inverso (ECL1i) peptide PET radiotracer that
targets CCR2 ([64Cu]DOTA-ECL1i). We have shown this radiotracer provides sensitive and specific detection of
CCR2 receptor expression in a human monocytic cell line and ex-vivo human peripheral arterial atherosclerotic
plaque and tracks disease progression and treatment response in pre-clinical atherosclerotic models. Moreover,
we have initial human subject PET data to suggest [64Cu]DOTA-ECL1i noninvasively detects atherosclerotic
lesions.
Our objective is to perform the initial evaluation of the imaging performance of [64Cu]DOTA-ECL1i in humans
with peripheral carotid and femoral arterial atherosclerosis and obtain key biological information that is
foundational for the design of future studies to assess its capability for diagnosis, prognosis assignment and
evaluation of new therapies. To achieve this objective we will address, in parallel, the following Aims:
Aim 1. Evaluate the performance of [64Cu]DOTA-ECL1i PET/MR to detect CCR2+ monocytes and
macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques from patients undergoing carotid or femoral endarterectomy
(CEA and FEA): In Aim 1A we will evaluate the imaging characteristics of [64Cu]DOTA-ECL1i in normal
volunteers (Group 1) and in patients undergoing CEA (Group 2) or FEA (Group 3). Imaging performance will be
determined by correlation with standard MR readouts of plaque presence, size and stage and with ex-vivo tissue
measurements of CCR2 content/expression and inflammation determined by autoradiography and molecular
profiling assays. As an exploratory Aim we will assess the relationship between hematopoiesis and
atherosclerotic plaque progression. In Aim 1B we will determine the reproducibility of this approach in patients
with carotid and femoral artery atherosclerotic occlusive disease managed non-operatively.
Aim 2. Determine in ex-vivo human atherosclerotic CEA and FEA plaque samples the relationship
between [64Cu]DOTA-ECL1i binding, CCR2+ cellular expression, immune cell composition, cytokine
expression and plaque complexity. Atheromas are often heterogeneous with areas of variable intraplaque
calcification, hemorrhage, and inflammation. We will define lesion types with variable [64Cu]DOTA-ECL1i signal
and characterize their cellular and molecular composition using autoradiography, multiplex
immunohistochemistry and spatial transcriptomics. As an exploratory analysis, we will correlate findings from
Aims 1A and 2A with known co-morbidities and risk factors for peripheral arterial atherosclerosis to determine
if there are specific patient populations that are more likely to have higher or lower CCR2 plaque content.
Successful completion of the proposed research will permit delineation of the importance of CCR2 expression
in human atherosclerosis, particularly involving sites that are relatively understudied such as peripheral arterial
disease. These results will lay the foundation for larger seminal multi-center studies to assess our imaging
approach to noninvasively detect CCR2 expressing cells in human atherosclerosis."

The overall goal of this proposal is to provide the training, career development, and mentorship that will result
in the candidate Dr. Carroll’s ability to develop an independent program of research that brings genetic studies
and personalized approaches to commercial smoking cessation treatment to the American Indian and Alaska
Native (AI/AN) population. Dr. Carroll is an Assistant Professor at the University of Minnesota (UMN) School of
Public Health with an appointment at the Masonic Cancer Center. Dr. Carroll completed graduate training in
epidemiology and public health, and undergraduate training in molecular genetics. She completed a two year
postdoctoral fellowship with the UMN Tobacco Research Programs with the support of an NIH T32 gaining
expertise in clinical trials. During the five years of this career development award, Dr. Carroll plans to develop
expertise in genetic contributors to smoking behavior, statistical analysis of genetic data, and qualitative data
skills for understanding barriers to genetic research in AI/AN. These areas of new training are essential for the
candidate to be able to fully serve Tribal communities who wish to embark upon genetic-based research and
approaches to smoking cessation. The candidate has a strong mentorship team that includes world-renowned
academic scientists and liaisons with the AI/AN community, and a relevant career development plan that will
enable her to develop into a successful academic investigator and compete for independent funding through
R01 grant mechanisms. The foundation of the research proposal is an existing collaboration with an AI Tribe
with a commercial smoking prevalence >60%. The goal of Aim I is to examine nicotine metabolism genotype
and phenotype data, which has evidence for optimizing cessation treatment, and relating to biomarkers of
nicotine dose and smoking intensity, and nicotine dependence among AI smokers. The applicant will also
explore social and cultural determinants of smoking behavior and therefore has the potential to provide a
comprehensive picture for why AI smoke at such high rates and have poor quit success. Aim II utilizes focus
groups to assess perceptions of and barriers to participating in genetic studies and genetically-informed
approaches to cessation treatment and ways to overcome barriers among AI smokers and their healthcare
providers. The goal of AIM III is to expand the candidate’s existing collaborations with AI Tribes so that the
candidate can assist more Tribes in developing effective cessation interventions. Ultimately, the completion of
this study will provide evidence of Dr. Carroll’s expertise in collaborating with AI tribes on a focused and highly
feasible genetic study and will allow for her to pursue additional genetic studies and genetically-informed
approaches to smoking cessation treatment in a population with a history of high smoking and low rates of
participating in genetic research. The result of this proposal and investment in the Dr. Carroll’s continued
training have the potential to dramatically reduce commercial cigarette smoking among the AI/AN population."

Early pregnancy loss affects 15-20% of implantation-confirmed pregnancies. Majority of these pregnancy losses
occur during first trimester and defective development of trophoblast progenitors, which assures embryo
implantation and placentation, is one of the leading causes for early pregnancy loss. However, we have a poor
understanding of molecular mechanisms that regulate trophoblast progenitor self-renewal, differentiation and
function in early postimplantation embryos. Our published and preliminary studies establish that hippo signaling
effector, transcription factor TEAD4 is conserved in trophoblast progenitors across mammalian species and is a
critical regulator to specify and maintain the trophoblast cell lineage during early mammalian development. The
overarching goal of this proposal is to further define TEAD4-mediated conserved molecular mechanisms that are
specifically involved in regulating trophoblast progenitor self-renewal and differentiation during post-implantation placenta
development. In addition, we will also test whether alteration of those mechanisms is associated with recurrent
pregnancy loss (RPL).
Three specific aims are proposed. Aim 1 will study mutant mouse models to test the hypothesis that TEAD4
regulates trophoblast stem-like progenitor cell (TSPC) self-renewal in early postimplantation embryos.
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that cell-autonomous function of TEAD4 in lineage-specific trophoblast
progenitors ensures proper development of differentiated trophoblast cells and formation of the maternal-fetal interface.
 In Aim 3, we will test functional importance of TEAD4 in human primary cytotrophoblasts (CTBs) and CTB-
derived human trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). We will also recruit patients with known history of recurrent pregnancy
loss (RPL) to isolate CTBs and establish patient-specific TSCs. The goal is to test the hypothesis that TEAD4 regulates
self-renewal of CTB progenitors in a developing human placenta and defective function of TEAD4 is the molecular cause
for a subset of unexplained (idiopathic) RPLs."
10809195,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Developmental delay in the maturation of the innate immune system and in particular reduced functionality of
interferon (IFN) pathways are recognized mechanisms of disease severity following viral respiratory infections
in early life. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in particular, represents the leading cause of severe lower
respiratory tract illness (LRTI) in young infants and children, with no therapies or vaccines currently available.
As part of our investigations focused on the isolation and structural characterization of epithelial-derived
subcellular fractions called extracellular vesicles (EVs) we discovered that EVs released from viral-infected
human airway epithelial cells contain biologically active type I and III IFNs, while EVs isolated from the upper
airways of patients with respiratory viral infections contain only type III IFN. EVs, a type of secretory vehicle
released from cells, are characterized by size and specific markers which has allowed their identification in
various human bio-fluids. EVs contain nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, and have been shown to transfer this
biologically active cargo between neighboring cells and to distant sites, therefore participating in processes of
cell-to-cell communication, inflammation, and disease pathogenesis. Overall, little is known regarding the
characteristics of EVs generated in vivo in human airways, how viral respiratory infections such as those
caused by RSV shape the EVs structural and cargo-related characteristics, and whether they contribute to the
antiviral immune response. Based on our work and this gap in the knowledge, Specific Aim 1 will characterize
the innate immune cargo of EVs isolated from the nasopharyngeal secretions (NPS) of children with acute
RSV infections and from cultures of human nose organoids (HNOs)-derived epithelial cells. The biological
activity of NPS and HNO EVs and EV-expressed IFNs will be tested by state-of-the art antiviral assays in RSV-
infected recipient lung epithelial cells. Mechanistic studies in Specific Aim 2 will determine the contribution of
RSV F and G proteins carried by EVs and EV cargo of nucleic acids and their respective cytosolic receptor(s),
in the process of EV internalization, antiviral gene expression and overall induction of an antiviral status in
target/recipient cells. Our published work and preliminary data support the concept that the packaging of innate
immune mediators in EVs secreted in the upper airway mucosa represents an important and currently
unknown antiviral mechanism directed not only to adjacent areas but also to sites far from of initial viral entry or
infection, such as the lower respiratory tract and lung. The results of studies proposed in this exploratory R21
will inform a future R01, which will include studies in a large cohort of viral-infected infants to determine
correlation between EV-associated IFNs/innate mediators and viral load in the nasal mucosa, disease severity
and progression (from upper to lower respiratory tract), and testing the hypothesis that upper airway EVs reach
the lung where they modulate antiviral responses using experimental animal models."

This project aims to establish a novel mechanism of human stem cell pluripotency control through nucleolar
structure integrity for functional ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) and proper genome organization/gene expression,
regulated by the nucleolar DEAD-box (DDX) RNA helicase DDX18. This paradigm contrasts with the extensively
studied direct transcription and translation control by well-established transcription factors and translation
regulators in the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. The nucleolus has mystified the research community for centuries
due to the elusive biophysical principles governing the well-known subcompartmental organization and limited
molecular tools interrogating their nuclear functions. Much work on the nucleolus has focused on its role in
regulating RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I) transcription and ribosome biogenesis; however, emerging evidence
points to the nucleolus as an organizing hub for many nuclear functions, accomplished via the shuttling of
proteins and nucleic acids between the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm. As a result, we know very little about
how the nucleolus maintains its membraneless structural integrity necessary to control stem cell-specific RiBi
and translation rates, as well as genome organization and gene expression. With the new technology that is
becoming available in studying biomolecular condensates and the realization of the roles of DDX RNA helicases
in cellular RNP condensates and RNA metabolism, this project will address novel nucleolar functions in
controlling conventional hESC pluripotency. Notably, nucleolar functions beyond the RiBi, such as the regulation
of nuclear architectures and genome stability in shaping cellular identities, have just begun to be appreciated,
providing a window of opportunity to explore a paradigm of pluripotency control beyond the well-established
nuclear transcription and cytoplasmic translation machinery. DDX18 is unique among many RNA helicases as it
is strictly nucleolus-specific, and its depletion alters gene expression through the impairment of the nucleolus
integrity pericentromeric heterochromatin reorganization, providing new evidence supporting the functions of the
nucleolus as an inter-chromosomal hub for 3D chromatin organization within ESCs. We hypothesize that DDX18
interacts with specific nucleolar partner proteins and snoRNAs/rRNAs to maintain nucleolar integrity and genome
architecture for controlling the pluripotency of hESCs. We propose two aims to test this hypothesis. 1) Define
the molecular traits of DDX18 in modulating LLPS for nucleolar structure integrity in hESCs. 2) Establish the
nucleolar functions of DDX18 in the organization of chromatin and gene expression to maintain hESC
pluripotency. 3) Dissect the roles of nucleolar DDX18 protein partners and RNA targets in maintaining nucleolar
structure integrity and hESC pluripotency. Upon the completion of this project, we will establish a novel paradigm
in which a nucleolar RNA helicase, namely DDX18, coordinates phase separation and chromatin organization
through its unique biophysical properties and functional partnerships with nucleolar cofactors and RNAs in
controlling human pluripotency."

Breast milk is a key regulator of host-microbiome interactions in early life. In addition to nutrients, breast milk
contains cytokines, growth factors and antibodies, which help shape the composition of the microbiota and
regulate infant immunity to gut microbes. Accumulating evidence links breastfeeding with a decreased risk of
developing immune-mediated and metabolic diseases later in life. However, the specific components of breast
milk and the mechanism underlying these associations are currently lacking. Using a mouse model, our lab
discovered that mice deficient in breast milk antibodies mount increased mucosal T cell- dependent immune
responses, including elevated T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and germinal center (GC) B cells in the gut-draining
lymphoid tissues. This process is driven by microbes as germ-free mice lacking breast milk antibodies do not
generate aberrant mucosal Tfh and GC B cell responses. Due to the profound impact of the gut microbiota on
the development of the immune system coupled with the lifelong persistence of activated adaptive immune cells,
a current paradigm is that inappropriate adaptive immune responses to gut bacteria drive adverse health
outcomes in the long-term. The hypothesis of this proposal is that inappropriate adaptive immune responses to
resident gut bacteria resulting from the absence of breast milk antibodies drives persistent impairments in
intestinal homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, two aims are proposed. Aim 1 investigates the persistence,
localization, and phenotype of B cells activated in the absence of maternal antibodies via fate-tracking activated
GC B cells and flow cytometry. Aim 2 assesses the function of the T cell dependent adaptive immune response
on intestinal homeostasis. The comprehensive phenotypic and functional characterization of the novel T cell
dependent immune response that arises in neonates lacking breast milk antibodies will provide key mechanistic
insight on how breastfeeding contributes to long-term health. The studies outlined here will lay the groundwork
for the development of interventions and therapies to manipulate host relationships with the microbiota and
promote long-term health, particularly in neonates who are not breastfed."
10811572,"HIV-1 assembly is driven by the viral Gag polyprotein, with host factors contributing essential activities. We and others have shown that host
machinery of the Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) pathway mediates the membrane fission reaction that releases
HIV-1 virions (termed “budding”), that the HECT ubiquitin E3 ligase NEDD4L stimulates release of HIV-1 constructs that cannot recruit ESCRT
factors directly, and that members of the Angiomotin (AMOT) family of NEDD4L-binding proteins promote progression of the assembling Gag
lattices from hemispheres to membrane-enveloped spheres (termed “envelopment”). Most recently, we have discovered that multiple different
mammals have independently evolved truncated, retrotransposed copies of a CHMP3 (ESCRT-III) protein that can potently inhibit release of
HIV-1 and other ESCRT-dependent enveloped viruses without undue cellular toxicity. We now propose to build on these observations by
pursuing complementary structural, biochemical, imaging, and functional approaches to address three central questions in HIV-1 biogenesis: 1)
How do assembling virions become wrapped in membranes? 2) How does the ESCRT machinery catalyze viral membrane constriction and
budding? 3) How can mammals protect themselves broadly against ESCRT-dependent viruses? In addition to their relevance for HIV, each of these
processes has analogs in other viral and/or cellular systems, which should extend the impact of our studies.
Specifically, we propose to characterize how AMOT-NEDD4L complexes contribute to HIV virion envelopment (Aim 1), how late-acting
ESCRT-III filaments and VPS4 ATPases collaborate to constrict membranes and promote fission (Aim 2), and how truncated, retrotransposed
CHMP3 proteins (retroCHMP3) can inhibit retroviral budding without inducing cellular toxicity (Aim 3). These Aims are buttressed by our
structural studies showing how the AMOT PPXY1 and NEDD4L WW3 domains form a high affinity complex (Aim 1), how ESCRT-III proteins
form soluble, monomeric proteins and membrane- bound filaments (Aims 2 and 3), and how VPS4 ATPases bind these filaments and remove
ESCRT-III subunits (Aim 2). Each Aim will also be supported by biochemical assays designed to elucidate how the AMOT-NEDD4L complex
remodels membranes, stabilizes F-actin, and activates NEDD4L ubiquitin E3 ligase activity (Aim 1), how essential ESCRT-III subunits co-
assemble and constrict membranes (Aim 2), and how retroCHMP3 interferes with ESCRT-III filament formation at sites of virus budding and
whether these proteins function as restriction factors in their natural settings (Aim 3). All of the Aims will be facilitated by genetic and imaging
assays that will help reveal the activities of AMOT, NEDD4L, ESCRT-III, VPS4 and retroCHMP3 variants as they function at cellular sites of
HIV-1 assembly and budding. Our goal is to use these complementary approaches to generate and test mechanistic models for three fundamental
processes in HIV-1 biogenesis.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
Enveloped viruses like HIV-1 spread infection by usurping host pathways to facilitate their release from cells. The goals of our
research are to understand precisely how HIV-1 utilizes these host pathways, and how innate immune systems can inhibit these
processes without inducing cell toxicity. These studies should help reveal how viruses and cells remodel membranes and identify
virus-specific interactions that are attractive targets for therapeutic intervention."

Treatment with endocrine therapy in combination with ovarian function suppression (OFS) for 5 years improves
disease-free survival in premenopausal women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer compared to
tamoxifen alone. However, there is a high rate of early treatment discontinuation, which can increase breast
cancer recurrence and mortality. Most patients who discontinue treatment prematurely do so because of
bothersome toxicities and decreased quality of life (QOL). Therefore, approaches are needed to improve
symptom management in young women at high risk of breast cancer recurrence.
Use of patient reported outcomes (PRO) improves patient-provider communication and patient satisfaction. In
advanced cancer, active symptom monitoring between clinic visits with a web-based tool improves health-related
QOL and increases overall survival. However, in early stage cancer there are limited if any data to support the
use of active symptom monitoring with PROs to impact disease outcomes.
The objectives of this R01 are to evaluate the effectiveness of active symptom monitoring on endocrine therapy
discontinuation, and to identify factors associated with benefit from this management approach. We hypothesize
that early identification of toxicity will change the symptom experience of patients, leading to increased
persistence with therapy. Therefore, we will apply the active symptom monitoring methodology to a diverse,
multiethnic cohort of premenopausal women with newly diagnosed high risk, early stage breast cancer. Our
proposed study will leverage the resources of the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) and
the SWOG Cancer Research Network. Patients initiating treatment with endocrine therapy plus OFS will be
enrolled and randomized to proactive, web-based symptom assessment plus patient education versus patient
education alone. The following Specific Aims will be addressed: (1) to investigate the impact of active symptom
monitoring on 18-month persistence with endocrine therapy, (2) to examine the effect of active symptom
monitoring on severity of key treatment-emergent symptoms in premenopausal women with early stage breast
cancer, and (3) to develop a risk prediction model to identify patients at increased risk of ET nonpersistence who
are likely to benefit from active symptom monitoring. Through this series of Aims we expect to demonstrate the
effectiveness of active symptom monitoring on persistence with and tolerance of endocrine therapy in a cohort
of young women with breast cancer. In addition, we expect to obtain new knowledge that will provide important
preliminary data to support future interventional studies targeting reasons for nonpersistence with endocrine
therapy. Improving persistence with endocrine therapy and reducing treatment-associated toxicity will lead to
improved disease outcomes and quality of life for young breast cancer survivors."
10811579,"Preeclampsia (PE), the development of new-onset hypertension and proteinuria after 20 weeks gestation, is a
severe pregnancy-specific disorder mediated by the placenta that affects 5% of all pregnancies. Women with
prior PE have an 2-4 fold increased lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease, including ischemic heart disease and
stroke. The underlying etiology of PE remains poorly understood; consequently, predictive and therapeutic
options remain limited. PE has a substantial heritable component estimated at 55-60%, with both maternal and
fetal contributions, estimated at 30-35% and 20%, respectively. Progress in understanding PE genetics has
lagged other disorders due to: the involvement of two genomes (maternal and fetal), disease heterogeneity, the
exclusion of obstetric phenotypes from many large cohort studies, and the lack of PE collections of adequate
sample size for power to identify genetic risk loci. Beyond genetics, profiling of PE using other omic strategies
has identified transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic alterations that precede disease. However, PE cohorts
with multiple omics on the same well-phenotyped individuals are lacking. To address these challenges and
advance understanding of PE pathophysiology, we propose to leverage TOPMed data in the “Boston-Colombia
Collaborative Adverse Pregnancy Outcome study” which capitalizes on two large, multi-ethnic pregnancy
cohorts, LIFECODES (Boston) and GenPE (Colombia). LIFECODES is an ongoing longitudinal pregnancy
cohort (2009–present, N >3000 pregnancies, 152 PE cases) with maternal samples from each trimester of
pregnancy and delivery samples. GenPE is a Colombian study (2000 – 2012, N = 3260 cases, 4331 controls)
created to identify maternal and fetal genetic risk variants. Specifically, for this proposal, we will leverage
TOPMed X01 funded whole genome sequencing (WGS) on the entire LIFECODES and GenPE cohorts, as well
as in-depth multi-omic profiling (metabolic, circulating microparticle proteomic and transcriptomic) on all
antepartum plasma samples in matched PE case-control samples within LIFECODES, expected to be available
before the grant start date. We propose three specific aims. First, we will perform gene discovery for
preeclampsia using common variant, rare variant, gene based and maternal-fetal interaction analyses. Second,
we will leverage longitudinal in-depth multi-omic profiling on all antepartum plasma samples in matched PE case-
control samples to identify molecular subtypes of PE and link these to known and novel genetic variants. Third,
we will test if polygenic risk scores for PE, supplemented by longitudinal molecular and clinical phenotypes,
predict maternal morbidity at delivery and future cardiovascular disease. Taken together, analysis of this multi-
omics project of PE in TOPMed, together with replication in independent cohorts, will yield novel insights into the
etiology of preeclampsia. As adverse pregnancy outcomes dramatically increase the risk of future
cardiometabolic disease in affected women, improved mechanistic understanding of pregnancy-related
disorders will enhance strategies for improving women’s health and preventing future cardiovascular disease."

 Observers of children or young animals will notice how much learning about the world depends on being
able to move within it. Indeed, studies in humans and other primates have shown that the motor cortex (M1) is
involved in working memory, empathy, and language. Could motor dysfunction contribute to the various
cognitive and affective deficits that occur in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD)? Conversely, could
improving motor function improve other aspects of NDD phenotypes? Recent work from my lab provides
evidence that this may be the case.
 We have been studying Rett Syndrome (RTT), which is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the X-
linked gene methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2) and is a leading monogenetic cause of NDD, affecting 1 in
10,000 live female births. The phenotype is striking for its postnatal onset: affected girls appear to develop
normally and reach the appropriate milestones for the first year or two of life before they regress, losing most
acquired skills and developing motor, cognitive, and social abnormalities. Both male and female Mecp2-
deficient mice replicate this natural history, and the delayed onset strongly suggests that although MeCP2 is
expressed from early development, it has additional, as-yet unclear functions in maintaining mature neurons
and synaptic connections. We therefore set out to ask two questions: 1) how does MeCP2 deficiency affect the
process of learning at the motor circuit level, and 2) would motor learning exert beneficial effects beyond the
particular skill learned? We used calcium two-photon imaging to simultaneously record excitatory activity in
layers 2/3 and 5a while 8-week old wild type and null male mice learned to adapt to changing speeds on a
computerized running wheel over two weeks of training. We found that a subgroup of M1 neurons in layers 2/3
and 5a strengthen their functional connectivity while the rest of the population decreases functional
connectivity, likely to maintain flexibility for learning new skills. Loss of MeCP2 attenuates but does not
abolish this reorganization: although cross-layer connectivity was much lower in the null mice, and the
functional connections between neuronal pairs in the null M1 circuit last half as long as those in WT, the null
M1 circuit retains enough plasticity to support motor skill learning. Moreover, trained null mice showed less
anxiety-like behavior and lived ~20% longer than untrained mice (manuscript under re-review). This is all the
more remarkable given that the entire brain is disrupted by loss of MeCP2. This work laid the foundation for
the current proposal, which seeks to understand the contributions of cortical inputs and inhibitory neurons to
L2/3 plasticity during learning, determine the effects of motor learning on M1 in female Mecp2 heterozygous
mice, and shed light on how 'normal' the M1 circuit actually is in presymptomatic RTT mice."

Most residents view research during training favorably, yet few engage actively in research due to several
barriers to pursuing a physician-scientist career. The Boston University-Boston Medical Center (BU-BMC)
Multi-Disciplinary Program for Promoting Research In MEdical Residency (PRIMER) targets barriers,
leverages BU’s renowned institutional strengths in heart, lung, blood and sleep (HLBS) research, and expands
our research training for internal medicine residents substantially. This application represents a renewal of our
highly successful residency research training (StARR) program. Our central objective is to provide a
comprehensive ~2-year (contiguous 22 months with 80% protected research time, i.e., 17.6 months of 100%
protected research time) training for medicine residents to pursue research in HLBS diseases, while ensuring
their clinical board eligibility, and transition to a K38 award and a clinical fellowship.
Our programmatic goals are to: (1) train 2 medicine residents every year over a 5-year period in one of four
cutting-edge HLBS research tracks, i.e., clinical epidemiology and translational research; genomics,
computational biology and bioinformatics; health systems research and implementation science; and
regenerative medicine, catering to both those with limited or advanced prior research training; (1a) train at least
2 underrepresented group (URG) and 3 women residents over the award period; (2) transition trainees to a
K38 award as part of a post-R38 clinical fellowship.
To achieve these goals, we offer the following specific aims (outcomes/milestones are underlined):
(1) Provide broad transdisciplinary competency-based training in approaches to HLBS research to a PGY3 and
a PGY4 resident every year, catering to both those with limited and substantial previous research experience.
We will enable attainment of core competencies including communication skills, grant writing, responsible
conduct of research, study design, analysis and interpretation, and leadership and team science.
(2) Feature personalized and mentored research projects for each trainee under the direction of an established
NIH- or NSF-funded investigator in one of the four HLBS training tracks resulting in excellent scholarship.
(3) Provide authentic career mentorship using an individualized development plan and ongoing assessment to
facilitate transition to board eligibility in internal medicine, a K38 award, and a clinical HLBS fellowship.
(4) Afford strong developmental support to recruit and retain trainees, especially URG and women residents.
(5) Evaluate PRIMER processes and monitor outcomes continuously with summative and formative activities.
PRIMER integrates program directors with complementary skills, a group mentoring approach with ‘trained’
research and career mentors, opportunities for training and scholarship in four HLBS training tracks, an
outstanding institutional environment that supports research, career and professional development of trainees,
a rigorous competency-based learner-centered curriculum, and ambitious URG and women recruitment goals."
10792588,"Project Summary/Abstract
MS is traditionally considered to be an autoimmune demyelinating disorder of the CNS. However there are a
number of inconsistencies with this “outside-in” hypothesis of MS pathogenesis which lead us to propose
instead that MS is primarily an “inside-out” disease, where a primary degeneration mainly targeting the myelin-
oligodendrocyte, secondarily entrains an auto-immune reaction in the predisposed host.
HYPOTHESIS: MS is a primary protein misfolding disorder targeting the myelinating unit, driven by
accumulation of transmissible protein aggregates. Specifically, this proteopathy is underpinned by a
pathological prion (in the generic sense) which promotes chronic toxicity of myelin and oligodendrocytes,
resulting in disruption of myelin integrity, leading to secondary autoimmunity, thus programming the broad
spectrum of inflammatory and progressive MS phenotypes.
Aim 1: Intracerebral transmission of MS-like pathology. This aim will conduct a detailed examination of our
ability to transmit an MS-like pathology from human brain homogenate (from deceased controls and
progressive MS subjects) to wild-type and humanized transgenic mice, via direct i.c. inoculation. This aim will
test the hypothesis that human MS brain contains toxic misfolded protein aggregates that can transmit
pathology and propagate in the recipient hosts. High- field MRI, (immuno)histology and behavior will be used
to monitor developing pathology. We expect to find pathology similar to “normal appearing white matter”
abnormalities in human MS brain (subtle myelinopathy, axonal damage, micro- and astrogliosis), and notably,
we do expect a significant lymphocytic response indicative of adaptive immunity. Negative controls (non-MS
human brain homogenate) will be performed to demonstrate MS specificity. Passaging (ie taking infected
transgenic mouse brain homogenate and re-inoculating into naïve mice) will show that the offending agent
continues to transmit. Prion protein is the etiological agent originally hypothesized, therefore experiments will
be tailored accordingly using PrP transgenics, recognizing that PrP and/or one of its interacting proteins could
also be playing a key role.
Aim 2: Intraperitoneal transmission of MS-like pathology. While direct i.c. inoculation is the most robust
method of transmitting prion-like misfolded proteins, it carries the risk of inducing non-specific pathology,
especially in strains that are more susceptible to various insults. This aim will attempt to transmit pathology via
a less invasive route using i.p. injections. Similar source material will be used. Advantages include potentially
earlier and more sensitive behavioural readouts (locomotor deficits, sensory abnormalities) if the expected
myelopathy is induced. Moreover, larger volumes of inocula and more frequent injections are possible with i.p.
compared to i.c. injection, potentially increasing the chances of transmission. Terminally, similar
(immuno)histology will be performed. We will also examine the spleen for evidence of misfolded protein
deposition as a clue to whether this organ participates in processing and amplification of transmissible seeds.
Aim 3: Biochemical analysis of human MS brain and passaged mouse CNS. A key observation made during
our preliminary biochemical studies showed a striking alteration in the interaction between prion protein and
myelin basic protein, one of the major myelin proteins. This aim will explore in greater detail this potentially
very important interaction that could be key for maintenance of myelin integrity. Immunoprecipitation, Westerns,
LC-MS and biochemical analysis will be performed to probe disruptions in this interaction. Focus will be on
citrullination of both proteins as this post- translational modification alters net charge, and therefore the
interaction efficiency, exerting a potentially important adverse influence on physiological protein-protein
interactions."
10792592,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, predicted to affect over 12
million people worldwide by 2040. There is no cure for PD and current treatments are merely symptomatic,
which underscores an urgent and unmet need for neuroprotective drugs. One major barrier for the inability to
develop effective and clinically translatable neuroprotective drugs is that no single animal model recapitulates
the complex process that leads to dopaminergic (DA) neuron loss in PD. Therefore, most drugs that succeed in
preclinical animal models fail to work in PD patients. The current proposal addresses this barrier by focusing
on hyperactivated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is an established convergent mechanism
downstream of multiple PD-related toxicities. ER stress consists of three signaling arms that culminate in the
translocation of three key proteins – ATF6, XBP1, and CHOP into the nucleus of DA neurons. Moderate
activation of ATF6 and XBP1 is neuroprotective, while chronic, uncontrolled activation of these proteins leads
to DA cell death. By contrast, activation of CHOP invariably causes cell death. Experiments showed that the
nicotinic compound cytisine causes an upregulation of specialized structures called ER exit sites (ERES), and
this is associated with an inhibition of ATF6 and XBP1. Surprisingly, experiments in a 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced preclinical toxin model of PD showed that cytisine is neuroprotective only in female mice.
Additional preliminary experiments showed that 17-β-estradiol inhibits CHOP expression in DA neurons, which
fits with strong sex-differences observed in the incidence and phenotype of PD, with men being more prone to
developing PD than women. Based on these data, this proposal hypothesizes that cytisine and estrogen exert
neuroprotection in female mice by synergistically inhibiting all three arms (ATF6, XBP1 and CHOP) of
hyperactivated ER stress in DA neurons. Experiments are proposed to determine the extent to which cytisine
requires ERES for exerting neuroprotection by specifically deleting ERES in DA neurons or by using nicotinic
compounds that cannot upregulate ERES. Female mice will be ovariectomized to determine mechanisms by
which specific subtypes of estrogen receptors exert neuroprotection in female mice. On completing
experiments in this proposal, key signaling targets through which cytisine and estrogen mediate
neuroprotective effects will be identified. Success in this proposal will lay groundwork for the long-term goal of
discovering clinically translatable neuroprotective PD drugs that work in both men and women."
10792593,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Significance: Oxygen supplementation (hyperoxia; HO) is the most frequently applied therapy for
hospitalized patients and the cornerstone of treatment for acute hypoxic respiratory failure (ARF). It is well known,
however, that HO exposure can not only promote existing lung injury but also initiate inflammation and barrier
dysfunction in otherwise healthy lungs. The inflammatory response evoked by HO is particularly damaging to
alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells causing cellular apoptosis and alveolar barrier disruption. Clinically, the
recognition of HO-induced acute lung injury (HALI) led to an increased awareness of oxygen toxicity and
efforts to minimize oxygen exposure for ARF patients. Although clinical and experimental studies have identified
several potential mechanisms underlying HALI, currently no therapies exist to prevent or counteract HALI, and
the length of hospitalization of ARF patients has remained unchanged for two decades. These findings
underscore the urgent need for identifying molecular targets to facilitate rational drug design against HALI.
 In the search for such new targets, we discovered TREK-1 potassium channels as potential new key
regulators of HALI. Our preliminary data support the novel hypothesis that HO downregulates epithelial and
endothelial TREK-1 channels, which results in cell membrane depolarization, subsequent opening of voltage-
gated Ca2+ channels, and as a consequence increased inflammatory mediator secretion, cell apoptosis and
alveolar barrier dysfunction. Furthermore, we propose that enhancement of TREK-1 activity can counteract this
injurious cascade.
We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims: In Aim1 we will identify the cell type(-s) predominantly
affected by HO-induced TREK-1 downregulation, using epithelial and endothelial cell-specific TREK-1 KO mouse
models and primary cells isolated from these mice. In Aim 2 we will determine the protective effects of TREK-1
enhancement against HALI using novel TREK-1 activating compounds, new cell type-specific TREK-1
overexpressing mouse models, and primary epithelial and endothelial cells isolated from these mice. In Aim 3
we will dissect the structural composition and biophysical properties of epithelial and endothelial TREK-1
channels at baseline and under HO conditions, and propose a novel signaling mechanism by which TREK-1
channels could regulate inflammation and barrier dysfunction during HALI.
This study will impact the field of acute lung injury by establishing aberrant epithelial and endothelial TREK-
1 signaling in the lung as a previously unrecognized pathway in HALI, and TREK-1 activation as the first targeted
therapeutic approach against HALI."
10811230,"Adipose tissue inflammation directly contributes to the overall inflammatory state in obesity, with immune cells being intimately involved regulating adipocyte function and vice versa. The cytokine, oncostatin M (OSM), is produced by adipose tissue macrophages. Our published data suggests that lack of OSM signaling on adipocytes via its receptor (OSMR) leads to adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance. Our preliminary data indicate that OSM signaling on adipocytes is required for proper adipose tissue function. The mechanisms adipocytes utilize to regulate adipose tissue inflammation in both health and disease remain unclear. We aim to address this knowledge gap by proposing a new regulatory role for the adipocyte. Specifically, we will test the overarching hypothesis that adipocytes tightly regulate free cytokine availability in AT to maintain insulin sensitivity and limit inflammation. Our recent findings are the basis for the specific aims of this proposal. In these aims, we will test the following hypotheses: (1) OSMR-dependent lipolysis is necessary for maintaining energy balance; (2) continued exposure of adipocytes to OSM results in OSMR desensitization, leading to adipocyte insulin resistance; and (3) excess stromal-derived factor 1 and OSM act on macrophages and preadipocytes, respectively, to promote AT inflammation."

The ability to leverage early biomarkers, clinical, and demographic data to accurately predict a patient’s likely
recovery trajectory following moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is paramount to allow definition of
appropriate therapeutic strategies and to evaluate medical decision-making in the context of critical decisions
such as early withdrawal of life supporting therapies. Prognostication of neurofunctional recovery following TBI,
however, is known to be as critical as challenging. Extensive work has shown that current approaches suffer
from high variability across physicians and medical centers, as well as a tendency for overestimation of poor
outcomes and underestimation of positive outcomes, and to be affected by non-clinical factors such as
geographic region and socioeconomic variation. To overcome such gaps in prognostication, this project is aimed
at developing and assessing novel frameworks that can be employed in early post-injury care. Specifically, we
leverage non-parametric models and machine learning techniques to fuse and incorporate routine multimodal
and multiplex magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals into a prediction framework. In two aims, we address
the ability of univariate multimodal fusion and machine learning architectures, respectively, to predict accurately
functional outcome at six months post injury on the sole basis of acute data, and compare their performance to
existing clinical algorithms. This project is thus aimed at developing a novel tools that can be easily deployed in
the Intensive Care Unit to help guide medical decision-making in an evidence-based manner. If the development
and assessment proposed in the present project is successful, the ultimate aim of this line of work is to develop
this research into broadly accessible platform that can be used by practicing clinicians all over the world to
supplement prognosis based solely on gross clinical indicators with quantitative and spatial multimodal MR data."

Postsynaptic kinase/phosphatase networks in amyloid b-induced synaptic dysfunction
Impaired synaptic function and synapse loss are early hallmarks of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). There is strong
evidence that amyloid beta (Ab) leads to AD-related synapse dysfunction and cognitive impairment. For example,
long-term potentiation (LTP), a key form of plasticity for learning and memory, is disrupted in mouse models
harboring familial AD-linked mutations that lead to Ab accumulation. Even acute applications of soluble Ab
oligomers block LTP within minutes and lead to synapse loss within days. It is increasingly appreciated that Ab
hijacks normal synaptic signaling pathways involved in plasticity, biasing them toward long-term depression
(LTD), or synapse weakening/elimination. LTP and LTD in the hippocampus are ultimately driven by insertion
and removal of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPAR) from synapses. Central to the signaling pathways
regulating AMPAR trafficking during LTP and LTD is a postsynaptic Ser/Thr kinase/phosphatases signaling
network that is coordinated by the scaffold protein AKAP79/150 and includes CaMKIIa, PKA, and
PP2B/calcineurin (CaN). During the last funding period we made several important discoveries regarding how
Ab engages local, postsynaptic LTD-associated signaling pathways to impair LTP. Central to the current
proposal, we observed that either acute Ab application or prolonged Ab exposure in the 5xFAD mouse model of
AD leads to accumulation of Ca2+-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) at hippocampal synapses. CP-AMPARs
are normally excluded from synapses but can be trafficked to synapses downstream of AKAP-anchored PKA
signaling to modify synaptic strength during plasticity in the healthy brain. However, in many cases, the
incorporation of CP-AMPARs biases subsequent synaptic signaling toward LTD, consistent with Ab-triggered
synapse depression and elimination. Thus, a new central premise established by the research previously funded
by this multi-PI R01 is that Ca2+ influx through CP-AMPARs plays a previously overlooked, but key role in
mediating Aβ synaptotoxicity. Additional data indicate that Ab may engage AKAP-PKA signaling via G-protein-
coupled b2-adrenergic (b2AR) and/or group I mGluR receptors. During the next funding period we will test the
overall hypothesis that b2AR/mGluR-AKAP-PKA signaling regulates synaptic recruitment of CP-AMPARs to
mediate not only acute impacts of Ab associated with LTP inhibition but also chronic impacts leading to dendritic
spine/excitatory synapse loss, long-term synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive impairments in vivo in 5xFAD mice."
10811525,"Here we interrogate a novel therapeutic strategy for improving outcomes of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in
older mice. We will test whether amplifying endothelial cell (EC) autophagy, EC glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1),
and/or PKC/PKD signaling serve as viable approaches for improving outcomes of this debilitating condition.
AIS deprives cerebral artery ECs of nutrients which decreases mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1
(mTORC1) activity and stimulates autophagic flux to support basal metabolism. We reported that aging
represses autophagic flux in ECs from mice and humans. We hypothesize that the age-associated impairment
of EC autophagy worsens AIS outcomes for three main reasons. First, if autophagy is stalled, damaged
organelles will accumulate and contribute to cellular toxicity. Second, autophagic flux avails the cell of
macromolecules generated from protein/organelle recycling that can be used for ATP production, and
impairments would lead to more pronounced energy deficiency. Third, EC autophagy elicits an important
metabolic reprogramming of cells that is critical for arterial vasodilation, which impacts blood and oxygen
delivery. We hypothesize that restoring EC autophagy in older mice improves AIS outcomes.
Several pieces of data support this contention. First, we found that mTORC1 inhibition increases whole-body
autophagy and improves outcomes of AIS. Conversely, inhibiting autophagy specifically in ECs worsens
outcomes of AIS. Underscoring the importance of EC autophagy, mice with EC specific depletion of autophagy
were refractory to benefits of whole-body autophagy upregulation. In Aim 1 (i) we will rejuvenate age-
associated reductions in EC autophagy via AAV-mediated delivery of ATG3 directly to ECs.
We find that EC autophagy compromise lowers glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) expression. Mechanistically, the
aging-associated decline in EC autophagy and EC GLUT1 blunts EC glycolytic flux and ATP production,
diminishing subsequent ATP/ADP-mediated purinergic 2Y1 receptor (P2Y1R) activation of endothelial nitric
oxide synthase. As such, EC GLUT1 is a tractable site for intervention downstream of defective EC autophagy.
In Aim 1 (ii) we predict that loss of EC GLUT1 worsens AIS outcomes in adult mice, whereas AAV-mediated
delivery of GLUT1 directly to ECs mitigates AIS outcomes in older mice [Aim 1 (iii)].
We reported that PKC/PKD activation provides the signaling link between the P2Y1R and endothelial nitric
oxide synthase. In autophagy and GLUT1 deficient ECs and arteries, function of both tissues can be re-
established by PKC/PKD activation using bryostatin-1. In Aim 2 we hypothesize that repurposing this approved
drug rejuvenates signaling to endothelial nitric oxide synthase to improve AIS outcomes in older mice.
Results from our studies could hasten development of therapeutics targeting EC metabolism to improve
cerebrovascular health and combat the debilitating complications of AIS in older persons."
10811042,"ABSTRACT
Mechanisms driving inflammation, and the possibilities for therapeutic intervention, have expanded dramatically
since the discovery that the intestine is linked to inflammatory diseases involving non-intestinal organs. The
processes and cell types underpinning this inter-organ link are poorly understood, even for diseases which are
coincident with intestinal inflammation. One prominent disease with clear links to intestinal inflammation is
primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), an immune-mediated disease hallmarked by liver fibrosis. There is no
therapy that prevents PSC from getting worse, and liver transplant is the only cure—although sometimes, PSC
can return even after liver transplant. The driving forces behind PSC-linked liver fibrosis are thought to originate
in the intestine and thus, understanding the inflammatory processes that link intestinal inflammation with liver
fibrosis would be a breakthrough for this disease. Moreover, these fundamental discoveries would shine new
light into processes that link the intestine to inflammation involving non-intestinal organs, an area that holds
potential for transformative therapeutics. This project will unlock some of this potential by dissecting cellular
mechanisms linking intestinal inflammation with liver fibrosis in a novel mouse model where these diseases occur
concomitantly. These studies will offer specific cell types for targeted approaches to treat diseases linked to the
intestine, including PSC-linked liver fibrosis, an unstoppable disease that has no cure."

 Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, debilitating disorder characterized by persistent allergic
inflammation that over time leads to fibrosis and stricture. While it is characterized by intense eosinophil and
mast cell infiltration, pathologic tissue remodeling events lead to irreversible fibrosis and significant clinical
symptoms. These remodeling events include epithelial basal cell hyperplasia and subepithelial fibrosis. Our
previous work has implicated lysyl oxidase (LOX), an enzyme known to cross-link collagen and potentiate tissue
stiffness, as a key mediator of pathologic esophageal remodeling. LOX is robustly expressed in the esophageal
mucosa of patients with active EoE inflammation, particularly in those with fibrosis. Robust in vitro and in vivo
data suggest that TGF signaling in esophageal epithelium enhances LOX production, which in turn, promotes
remodeling in both the epithelial (basal cell hyperplasia) and fibroblast compartments. We therefore seek to
define the mechanisms whereby epithelial TGF and LOX promote remodeling in the esophagus and further
exploit these mechanisms for clinical application. We hypothesize that the epithelial TGF-LOX axis drives basal
cell hyperplasia and fibrostenosis in EoE. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the cell autonomous effects of epithelial
LOX, evaluating how epithelial TGF drives LOX-induced basal cell hyperplasia in 3D epithelial culture and
chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the non-cell autonomous effects of epithelial
TGF and LOX by evaluating their effects on fibroblast activation and tissue stiffness. And finally, in Aim 3 we
will evaluate the therapeutic and prognostic potential of this pathway by performing pre-clinical proof of purpose
studies, treating mice with EoE inflammation with anti-TGF antibody and validating LOX expression in EoE
patient tissue. Data from this study will inform future therapies targeting tissue remodeling as well as work
towards identifying patients with fibrotic disease prior to the onset of disability.

10854873,"Background: Chronic pain is common in Veterans and astute rehabilitation plans are critical to avoid deleterious
outcomes for functional outcomes and other quality of life (QoL). Attaining optimal functional outcomes after pain
rehabilitation is challenging, however, in cases when a significant portion of disability stems from “nonorganic”
psychological factors. Disability from primarily psychologically-driven factors would make a Veteran a poor
candidate for invasive medical procedures (which would have minimal benefit and potential harms). Nonorganic
pain has been traditionally probed using clinician-rated “Waddell signs.” However, these signs are inconsistently
probed, with questionable inter-rater reliability and can be challenging in the VHA wherein symptom endorsement
can be financially reinforced. Therefore, there is a critical need for a time-sensitive, hard-to-feign objective marker
of psychologically-driven disability for treatment planning. This project is a proof-of-concept study to determine
whether subconscious bias toward pain, such as attentional capture by pain-related stimuli, correlates with mood
symptomatology and clinician impressions of psychologically-driven disability at intake, with an exploratory aim
of relating bias metrics to pain treatment outcomes. Approach: Over a 15-month period, 50 Veterans slated for
assessment at a VA medical center (VAMC) pain clinic and 30 “control” Veterans slated for a non-pain-related
appointment (e.g. Primary Care) with minimal pain histories will identified from electronic medical records (EMR)
and approached prior to their intake appointment and invited to complete a ~90-minute assessment battery on
a portable touchscreen-tablet-PC, either in their home or at the VAMC. This battery will be composed of
interview-based instruments of pain symptomatology and disability (e.g. occupational function), affective
symptomatology and QoL, as well as performance of neurocognitive tasks of subconscious bias toward pain-
related concepts/words and pain-related images. Comparator tasks of impulsivity and frustration tolerance will
also be included. This assessment will conclude with the patient making ratings of the burden or aversiveness
of the assessments themselves. Six months following this assessment, participants will repeat by telephone
interview the pain symptom, pain disability and QoL assessment items probed at baseline. In addition to the core
goal of probing the feasibility of computerized bias assessment in Veterans with chronic pain, analyses will test
for: 1) differences in subconscious pain bias between pain and non-pain patients, and 2) correlations between
subconscious bias and mood/pain/disability/QoL symptom scores at baseline, to assess the core validity of
probing subconscious bias measures in pain patients. As value-added supplemental analyses, we will: 1) relate
assessment items (both bias tasks and interview instrument scores) to Waddell ratings of intake clinicians noted
in EMR, 2) relate attentional (implicit) bias scores to pain and disability ratings at follow-up. Follow-on MERIT
projects: Many Veterans who show signs of psychologically-driven disability are reluctant to adopt provider
recommendations to seek integrative mental health care. To help providers motivate these patients, follow-on
MERIT studies will collect evidence that Veterans with psychologically-driven pain disability selectively benefit
from wrap-around mental health care. The strongest neurobehavioral markers (of self-reported and clinician-
rated psychological distress) from the laptop assessment of this I21 project will be ported to a mobile app testing
platform for a full-scale observational study designed to show whether app (task) results are predictive of pain
treatment outcomes, as a function of whether mental health services were utilized. These data will enable the
testing app to return actual bias “risk” scores to the patient and provider. In a subsequent clinical trial of the app’s
risk score, we will compare functional rehabilitation outcomes when the psychological risk rating is (one study
arm) vs is not (other arm) available to the provider for treatment planning. Rehabilitation outcomes in terms of
whole QoL and pain symptomatology will be tracked and compared between groups as a function of (interaction
with) whether app-flagged (probable-nonorganic pain) cases were given integrative mental health services."
10814142,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Using a proteomic screen of samples obtained from the aorta and renal vein of human subjects, we
recently identified testican-2 as a podocyte-derived protein that is released by the kidney into circulation. Further,
we found that testican-2 levels are positively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and
higher baseline levels of testican-2 are associated with less eGFR loss over time, advancing the concept that
testican-2 provides insight on kidney health and prognosis. However, the biological function of testican-2 in
podocytes and the kidney is unknown. Encoded by the SPOCK2 gene, testican-2 is a glycoprotein that is a
component of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In preliminary data generated by the PI, we find that testican-2
attenuates podocyte injury induced by Adriamcyin both in cultured human podocytes and mice. We further find
that testican-2 binds to another ECM protein vitronectin and reduces its binding affinity to integrin αVβ3, an
adhesion protein on the podocyte surface. Using these findings as a springboard, this proposal will test the
central hypothesis that testican-2 plays a functional role in podocyte health by reducing vitronectin-mediated
integrin αVβ3 activation and signaling: Aim 1) To determine the protein domain required for testican-2 binding
with vitronectin; Aim 2) To determine the impact of testican-2 on integrin αVβ3 activation and podocyte injury;
and Aim 3) To assess testican-2 expression in patients with diabetic nephropathy and primary focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis. The candidate, Dr. Wen, is deeply committed to a career in academic nephrology. He
previously pursued broad-based research training in nephrology, with a particular focus on renal physiology.
Since pursuing a nephrology fellowship in 2018, he has shifted his focus to a new area—the biological function
of testican-2 in podocyte health, with both basic and translational approaches. Dr. Wen’s immediate career goals
include acquiring content knowledge and hands-on experience with emerging technologies in the areas of
podocyte biology; protein-protein interaction and structure; and blood and tissue biomarkers. In addition, he
seeks training with public speaking and grant and manuscript writing. Dr. Wen’s long-term career goal is to
become an independent physician-scientist who pursues both basic and translational approaches to develop
new therapeutic strategies for patients with podocytes injury, and kidney disease in general. He will benefit from
complementary mentorship from Eugene Rhee (mentor; Chief, MGH Nephrology), an expert in kidney
metabolism and biomarkers; and Martin Pollak (co-mentor, Chief, BIDMC Nephrology), a leader in genetics and
podocyte biology. Drs. Wen, Rhee, and Pollak will meet frequently to discuss both science and career
development and have clearly identified aspects of the research proposed that will form the basis of his
independent career. An advisory committee will provide additional guidance, evaluate progress, and help plan
future directions."
10931640,"Project Summary
 Three-dimensional organoid technology, utilizing human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), is a valuable system
successfully utilized for over a decade to investigate organ development and model diseases. However, standard
strategies for modeling human gonad development and studying causes of differences and disorders of sex
development (DSD) and infertility are not established.
 We have developed a novel, simple, bioreactor-based organoid system for modeling early human gonad
development using hPSCs. However, generated gonad organoids have not been comprehensively
characterized. In Aim 1 we will characterize the male and female human gonad organoids at different stages of
development. We will utilize combined “omics” approaches that will concomitantly determine the transcriptome
and epigenome of single cells and map their position within the gonad organoid. Combined, these data will
enable us to identify cell sub-populations that we will evaluate against corresponding stages of human (and other
mammals) embryonic and fetal gonad development at high resolution. These studies will lay the foundation of
standardized organoid protocols for modeling male and female gonad development during embryogenesis.
 hPSCs are a perfect model system to engineer diseased phenotypes in diverse tissues. We will use our gonad
organoid models to mimic examples of DSD. DSD occur at a ratio as high as 1:200 to 1:300 when all congenital
anomalies are considered. DSD can arise from sex chromosome aneuploidy or mutations in genes required for
sex determination and development of the testis or ovary. In Aim 2, we will use CRISPR-Cas9 to create hPSCs
that harbor SOX9 enhancer mutations that were recently discovered to cause DSD in males and females. Mutant
SOX9 enhancer hSPCs will be used to create organoids in our bioreactor-based organoid system, gonad
development will be assessed, and results will be compared to those obtained from our studies in Aim 1.
 We will extend our gonad organoid studies to assess germ cell development. To date, human primordial germ
cell-like cells (PGCLCs) can be successfully generated from hPSCs in vitro, which we have recapitulated in our
lab. However, the production of meiosis-competent cells and fertilization-competent gametes remains a
challenge. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that hPSC-derived gonad organoids will serve as an optimal
environment for PGCLCs to undergo colonization, differentiation, and gain the capacity to undergo
gametogenesis. We will use optimized standard procedures and “omics” approaches to characterize these
PGCLC-containing organoids and compare them to data obtained from Aim 1, as well as data obtained using
human embryonic gonads.
 The success of our research objectives will lead to the establishment of testis and ovary organoid systems
that can be used for diagnostic assays, toxicity and drug screening, contraception testing, disease modeling, as
well as assisted reproduction."

An urgent need currently exists for medical devices developed specifically for children. Barriers to pediatric
device development include economic, clinical, regulatory, reimbursement, and business model challenges,
combined with a lack of established mechanisms for connecting pediatric device ideas with qualified individuals,
programs, and industry partners. The smaller population and market sizes associated with pediatric devices can
prevent progression through market-based approaches used to commercialize adult devices. The Southwest
National Pediatric Device Innovation Consortium (SWPDC) supports regional and national pediatric device
innovators with product and technology acceleration services and business acceleration services with its existing
translational and commercialization network to help novel pediatric medical devices progress to
commercialization and clinical use. SWPDC has been improving children’s health by facilitating partnerships
between the faculty, students, and resources of the largest children’s hospital in the U.S., a growing hub-and-
spoke network of children’s hospitals, and established academic engineering programs at major universities, as
well as supporting pediatric device innovators with comprehensive pediatric device development services to
create novel pediatric medical devices with local, regional, and national institutional and innovation partners. The
consortium also includes local device development firms offering clinical, scientific, business, financial,
regulatory, reimbursement, engineering, ISO13485-compliant product design and manufacturing, and
intellectual property expertise in the Southwest/Midwest U.S. regions. The consortium will also work to identify
and address current barriers to the development and commercialization of pediatric devices, with a particular
focus on establishing a productive needs-driven pipeline of new pediatric medical devices. SWPDC will also
continue its work to foster collaboration, diversity, equity, and inclusion toward creating a national network for
pediatric device development that benefits all pediatric patients including those in underserved populations and
which utilizes the existing expertise and infrastructure of U.S. children’s hospitals to support the accelerated
development of innovative pediatric devices in partnership with public and private sector stakeholders.
Furthermore, the consortium’s Real World Evidence demonstration projects represents a continued collaboration
between a large children’s hospital health system and a large engineering university with its National Science
Foundation-funded Engineering Research Center, PATHS-UP, for a comprehensive and scalable Real-World
Data/Evidence demonstration projects program that support pediatric device innovation at various stages that
also promotes inclusion, engagement, and participation of diverse and inclusive populations. This will contribute
to the creation of a national service center for pediatric real word data/evidence projects that support medical
device companies and startups with evidence generation towards pre/post regulatory approval, value analysis,
pediatric labeling expansion studies, and market adoption."
10912811,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US, with most lung cancer diagnosed at advanced
stages. Low-dose CT screening of high-risk individuals is the only evidence-based tool available to diagnose
lung cancer at an early stage when curable treatment options exist. The promising mortality reduction benefit of
lung cancer screening (LCS) is presently overwhelmingly unfulfilled due to suboptimal population-based
adherence to annual screening guidelines. Outside of research settings, adherence to annual LCS is less than
half of the rates observed in the practice-changing, landmark clinical trials. There is an urgent need for effective
and feasible interventions to improve LCS adherence and achieve optimal individual and population health
benefits. Research during the F99 phase will leverage an innovative, multi-phase, mixed methods design to
describe how LCS patients process health information regarding health protective behavior and utilize this
information to develop and evaluate reminder messages with individuals eligible for LCS. Using a four-step
process, data collected in a survey of LCS program participants (step 1) will inform the development of a pool of
candidate reminder messages (step 2). In the final two steps, the reminder messages will be evaluated by LCS
experts (step 3) and further evaluated and refined with LCS program participants (step 4) using mixed methods,
including surveys and interviews. Differences between health information processing constructs by demographic
or clinical characteristics found to be significant from step 1 will be the focus for message targeting (group level)
and/or tailoring (individual level). At the conclusion of the F99 phase, I will have a formalized set of clear,
engaging, and efficient messages to support LCS annual adherence, ready to be evaluated in a clinical setting.
Research proposed in the K00 phase will focus on gaining real-world experience with hybrid effectiveness
implementation study designs and pragmatic outcome measures to simultaneously assess effectiveness and
implementation outcomes. Specifically, I propose a mentored pre-post type 1 hybrid effectiveness-
implementation trial, within a parent trial, that will allow concurrent assessment of effectiveness and
implementation outcomes of the F99 reminder strategy in real-world LCS programs. Effectiveness will be tested
using a pre-post design, comparing percent screening participants adherent to annual screening guidelines
before and after implementation of the reminder strategy. Secondary implementation outcomes (i.e.,
acceptability and feasibility) will be assessed with surveys and key informant interviews of personnel involved in
the reminder system implementation (e.g., LCS program directors, navigators, coordinators). This body of
research will prepare me for a career as an independent cancer-focused intervention scientist with expertise in
the development and implementation of effective, low-burden interventions aimed at improving LCS adherence,
maximizing screening benefit, and reducing lung cancer mortality."
10818666,"Project Summary/Abstract
Fibrosis is a hallmark of cancer that promotes proliferation, metastasis, and immune evasion by altering the
tumor stroma which accounts for up to 90% of tumor mass. In fibrosis, pathogenic departure from homeostasis
results in the excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) by myofibroblasts, creating discrete regions of
non-resolving wound repair. These regions of fibrotic ECM become dominant regulators of cell phenotype,
providing both biochemical (i.e. ECM composition and soluble factors) and biophysical (i.e. mechanical forces
and material properties) cues to promote tumor progression and restrict immune cell infiltration. Soluble factors
within the interstitial space of these fibrotic organs drain into surrounding lymph nodes (LNs) and induce fibrotic
remodeling in the LN, a common sign of poor prognosis in cancer and other fibrotic pathologies. LNs have a
distinct microenvironment known as the conduit system, which traffics antigens and serves as a migratory
scaffold for lymphocytes. In health, its organization facilitates interactions between T cells and antigen presenting
cells to ensure robust immune activation in response to cancer, pathogens, and injury. Fibroblastic reticular cells
(FRCs) construct and ensheath this collagenous network and produce cytokines that promote T cell survival and
homeostasis. Disruption of this ECM network leads to T cell dysregulation and depletion, implicating lymph node
fibrosis in disease progression. The mechanisms of fibrotic initiation in the LN and the effect of LN fibrosis in T
cell function is poorly understood, yet represent an attractive therapeutic opportunity. In other tissues, fibrotic
remodeling mechanically stiffens the microenvironment, initiating integrin-mediated signaling cascades. I
hypothesize that similar mechanisms drive LN fibrosis by FRCs, and seek to explore how remodeling of the LN
microenvironment affects development of T cell responses in fibrosis and cancer.
The first aim of this proposal (F99 phase) evaluates whether integrin signaling drives LN fibrosis by promoting
FRC-to-myofibroblast differentiation. This will be accomplished in part by analyzing LNs from Idiopathic
Pulmonary Fibrosis and melanoma patients with advanced mechanobiological (atomic force microscopy) and
spatial-omic imaging (CODEX) methods to measure stiffness, ECM content, and FRC/T cell phenotypes. The
knowledge and skills learned in Aim 1 are then applied in Aim 2 (K00 phase) to study the impact of fibrosis in
tumor draining LNs on anti-tumor T cell responses in murine models of melanoma."
10897048,"Abstract: Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are found in over 50% of human proteins where they play essential roles
in a wide range of cellular functions including transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, cell signaling, and apoptosis. As a
result of their importance in key processes associated with cellular growth, proliferation, and death, proteins containing
IDPs are often associated with cancer. The ability of IDPs to adopt a wide range of conformations raises a number of key
challenges to standard biochemical, biophysical, and computational techniques. Despite these challenges, our ability to treat
many cancers depends on an understanding of the molecular basis for diseases. This, in turn, presents a pressing need to
understand the mechanistic basis of IDP function and dysfunction. This proposal will study protein-nucleic acid interactions
driven by intrinsically disordered proteins in two pressing diseases: COVID-19 and cancer. For the F99 phase (Aim 1) of
the award, I will build upon my computational and experimental biophysics training to continue investigating the SARS-
CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and its ability to package its viral genome. The COVID-19 pandemic, preceded by previous
coronavirus outbreaks caused by SARS and MERS, necessitates study of these viruses in order to better combat them.
Coronaviruses contain large RNA genomes that are packaged into a relatively small virion, mediated by the nucleocapsid
protein, a highly disordered multidomain RNA binding protein. A current outstanding question is how SARS-CoV-2
package their 30 kb genomes into a relatively small (<100 nm) virion. The conserved structural motifs in coronavirus
genomes known as packaging signals has been shown to confer genome specificity, yet the relationship between packaging
signals and genome compaction are opaque. My thesis work combines single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy with all-
atom and coarse-grained simulations to construct a mechanistic understanding of how N protein drives RNA packaging.
Success of this project will reveal the role of IDP-encoded multivalency in selective genome packaging. Since the
architecture of the nucleocapsid protein is conserved throughout coronaviruses it will also present new insight into
mechanisms that can be broadly targeted for therapeutic intervention. The K00 phase (Aim 2) of this proposal will study
the contribution of IDPs in transcriptional regulation, genome organization and cancer development. Fusion-oncogenes are
a common genetic translocation event which often involve a DNA binding domain becoming fused to an IDP. During the
post-doctoral phase I will obtain training in super-resolution microscopy to investigate the effects of transcriptionally active
fusion-oncogenes. Several studies have shown that IDPs from transcription factors drive the formation of transcriptional
assemblies (transcriptional condensates) at sites of gene expression. I will test the hypothesis that fusion-oncoproteins lead
to the formation of long-lived aberrant transcriptional condensates that drive the expression of proliferative genes. This will
provide direct mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of fusion-oncogene driven cancers. These combined training
plans will prepare me for a successful research career using quantitative biophysical and single-molecule techniques in the
field of mechanistic cancer biology."
10785057,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Alternative splicing (AS) is the fundamental mechanism of generating isoform diversity in eukaryotic cells.
AS occurs at an especially high frequency in the retina and other nervous system tissues, contributing to many
important cellular and physiological functions within the cells, including tightly regulated and complex processes
like neuronal development. Moreover, dysregulation of AS can have a substantial impact on retinal survival and
function. Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited retinal diseases that cause dysfunction and
degeneration of the light-sensitive photoreceptor layer of the eye, resulting in irreversible vision loss and
blindness in over 1.5 million people worldwide. Yet, therapeutic options for these patients remain limited. Many
mutations that cause mis-splicing of a gene cause RP. Furthermore, defects in the regulation of AS, including
mutations in spliceosome components and other associated splicing factors, also cause disease. It is unknown
why retinal cells are so particularly, and often exclusively, susceptible to aberrant splicing, despite these defects
often occurring in either ubiquitously expressed genes or from mutated splicing factors found in all tissues of the
body. By combining novel long-read RNA-sequencing technology with CRISPR engineering and 3D human stem
cell organoid models, we can acquire a detailed understanding of AS and learn how dysregulated AS contributes
to retina-specific disease. To further investigate the AS landscape in human retinal development and disease,
this proposal aims to 1) comprehensively examine the AS events in rod and cone photoreceptors that occur
during differentiation of human stem cell-derived retinal organoids, 2) investigate how splicing factor mutations
alter normal AS in the retina compared to other neurons, and 3) understand how dysregulated gene expression
that results from aberrant splicing causes retina-specific degeneration. During the mentored phase of this
proposal, I will take advantage of the many strengths of my multidisciplinary team of mentor/co-mentors,
advisors, and collaborators to perform and analyze the single cell long-read transcriptomic experiments with the
developing retinal organoids and acquire the training needed regarding brain organoid differentiation and
CRISPR methodologies to successfully transition myself to the independent research phase. In the independent
phase, I will use the splicing factor mutant cell lines generated in the Zack lab to further understand the
mechanism(s) of retinal-specific degeneration caused by dysregulated AS events. The experiments proposed
will not only provide the retinal field with a more complete understanding of AS in the retina, knowledge which
can possibly be harnessed to design new treatment options for RP, but the training plan we have developed will
also provide a robust pathway to establishing my successful and productive independent research career that
extends well beyond the aims of this grant."
10785263,"Abstract
Ovarian cancer remains the most lethal gynecological malignancy due to the lack of highly sensitive and specific
screening tools for detection of early-stage disease. The goal of the proposed study is to explore the viability of
a novel Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA)-based detection tool for the early detection of ovarian cancer. PiRNAs are
an abundant class of small (26-32 nt) noncoding RNAs with over 30,000 known human members and play a
pivotal role in the maintenance of genomic stability via epigenetic silencing of transposable elements (TE).
Recent evidence from our group and others has suggested that piRNAs can also induce DNA methylation at
non-TE protein coding genes, including cancer-related genes in somatic cells. Our ongoing analyses have
observed marked differences in expression of several piRNAs between ovarian cancer tissues and normal
ovarian tissues. As a novel group of small noncoding RNAs, no published work has examined the potential use
of piRNAs for the early detection of ovarian cancer. The proposed study will test the hypothesis that piRNAs can
serve as a novel group of blood-based biomarkers for the early detection of ovarian cancer. We will perform
piRNA sequencing (piSeq) analysis to detect over-expressed piRNA candidates in 1) early stage (I-II) ovarian
tumor tissues compared to fallopian tube tissues from control subjects (Aim 1) and 2) in serum samples from
early stage (I-II) ovarian cancer patients compared to matched normal subjects (Aim 2). This exploratory study
will provide proof of concept for future large population-based studies to further investigate the translational role
of piRNA in ovarian cancer, which would accelerate our understanding of the role of piRNAs in ovarian
tumorigenesis and provide new avenues of research to facilitate the development of innovative diagnostic
biomarkers for ovarian cancer."
10785276,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Sociality is a fundamental part of our rich life as social animals. Notably, abnormalities in social cognition
are a hallmark of various psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. Understanding the social
brain, the neural basis of social behavior, is an essential step toward addressing these issues. One of the
building blocks of social cognition is social memory, which comprises familiarity, the sense that an individual was
previously encountered, and recollection, the detailed storage and recall of social episodes. However, these two
processes have conflicting computational requirements: while familiarity requires abstraction and generalization,
recollection involves the creation of specialized representations to efficiently memorize many complex, multi-
sensory experiences. The question of how the brain implements these two processes to achieve social memory
is still open. One hypothesis is that these two processes are simultaneously implemented, and used in synergy
to optimize memory, by the hippocampal-cortical network. Here, I will test this hypothesis using artificial neural
networks and neural recordings from mice and human subjects exposed to social stimuli.
 In the first aim, I will analyze data from the entorhinal cortex (EC), the main input region to the hippocampus,
of mice interacting with familiar and novel conspecifics and compare it to previous hippocampal data to reveal the
specific roles of these regions during social cognition. In the second aim, I will develop a modular computational
model inspired by the connectivity structure of the hippocampus with the EC and the neocortex, and use it to test
how specialization and abstraction can be used in synergy to achieve efficient memory. This model will be trained
to reproduce the mouse data and used to make testable predictions on how social representations in hippocampal
and cortical regions change during learning. Finally, in the third aim, I will extend the analysis to human cognition
by first analyzing previous single-cell recordings of human patients exposed to familiar and novel faces. I will
then co-design a new experiment to reveal the coordinated change of the neural code in simultaneously-recorded
hippocampal and cortical regions and directly test how the synergy between abstraction and specialization can
improve memory.
 Given my quantitative training and extensive experience in collaborating with experimentalists, I am in a unique
position to conduct this work at the interface between computational modeling and cross-species data analysis.
The K99 phase of this work will take place at the Zuckerman Institute at Columbia University, a vibrant and immer-
sive scientific hub hosting world-class theoreticians and experimental neuroscientists. Thanks to the mentorship
of Drs. Fusi, Siegelbaum, and Rutishauser, all of whom are leaders in their fields, this project will allow me to
complete my training and start an independent group in interdisciplinary computational neuroscience."
10785231,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Glioblastoma (GBM) is an uncurable form of primary brain tumor with extremely poor prognosis. Despite multi-
modal therapy including surgery, irradiation and chemotherapy, all patients experience tumor progression. No
standard of care is established in recurrent or progressive GBM. The identification of a neuronal cellular state of
GBM as a more differentiated state enriched at recurrence and periphery of the tumor provides new insights into
how neuronal activity regulates tumor invasion. Deconvolution of normal cell types from single-cell RNAseq and
bulk tumors revealed that neuronal state of GBM is associated with high infiltration of non-malignant cells. The
intricate synaptic communications between neurons and brain tumor cells are crucial for glioma progression and
resistance to standard therapies, which is supported by ample data from the rapidly emerging field of “cancer
neuroscience”. However, the molecular mechanisms driving enhanced neuronal activity at recurrence remains
to be understood. Dissecting the spatiotemporal dynamics of glioma eco-system during evolution will be
necessary to identify therapeutic vulnerability of recurrent GBM. Here, proteogenomics and single-nuclei
RNAseq profiling of matched primary and recurrent GBM IDH wild-type suggest that the evolutionary transition
from a more proliferative-progenitor towards the neuronal state in GBM is regulated by both genetic and post-
genetic molecular events and potential functional interactions between malignant and non-malignant cells. In
Aim 1, the development of a multiomics-based network diffusion approach will enlighten subnetworks of
proteins/phospho-proteins significantly affected by upstream genetic events driving activation of neuronal
programs during progression. Generation of in silico knock-out networks screen and integrative analysis of
proteomics and pharmacological data of cancer cell lines will prioritize lethal and essential proteins in the
subnetworks to identify potential therapeutic vulnerabilities in neuronal-recurrent GBM. In Aim 2, single-nuclei
and spatial transcriptomics profiling of matched primary and recurrent GBM IDH wild-type will identify the
functional connections between neurodevelopmental tumor cellular states and cell types in tumor
microenvironment. The development of a spatial informed cell–cell communications algorithm and the
reconstruction of intercellular signaling networks will infer the key functional interactions between
neurodevelopmental tumor cellular states and cell types in tumor microenvironment along with the potential effect
of these interactions on downstream regulatory molecular pathways. These studies lay the foundation for my
future research program and will advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediating glioma
connectomes and driving glioma invasion. These studies will advance the neuroscience field through discovery
of targetable pathways and proteins providing therapeutic opportunities for recurrent GBM."
10789902,"ABSTRACT
The “fight-or-flight” response refers to the state of heightened physiological and mental arousal triggered by a
physical threat, emotionally charged event, or metabolic disturbance. Although the precise reaction to each
stressor may vary, all share some basic characteristics of sympathetic nervous system activation.
Adrenomedullary chromaffin cells are core effectors of the sympathetic response in the periphery. When
activated during stress, they discharge a cocktail of hormones into the suprarenal vein for circulation
throughout the body. These hormones modulate cardiac, pulmonary, and metabolic functions in ways that
favor survival or maintain internal conditions when they are threatened. Secretion from the adrenal medulla is
dependent on input from preganglionic splanchnic fibers, which release acetylcholine (ACh) and pituitary
adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) onto chromaffin cells. What remains poorly understood is
how ACh and PACAP tune hormone release to accommodate the range of splanchnic firing frequencies
associated with variations in sympathetic tone. Three Specific Aims are proposed to fill this gap in our
understanding of the stress response pathway. The Aims will test the overall hypothesis that variations in
presynaptic splanchnic input are translated by different receptor-coupled pathways in chromaffin cells to
dynamically regulate the amount of hormone output. Aim 1 builds on recent preliminary data that shows, for
the first time, a role for any synaptotagmin (Syt) at the splanchnic-chromaffin cell synapse. Planned studies,
using in situ slice electrophysiology, will define the role of Ca2+ sensing at this synapse, and evaluate the idea
that synaptic facilitation, regulated by Syt7, amplifies hormone discharge from chromaffin cells when
splanchnic fibers discharge at high frequencies. Aim 2 is motivated by preliminary data that shows
Phospholipase C-epsilon (PLC) is required for transducing PACAP stimulation into Ca2+ signals in chromaffin
cells that cause exocytosis. PACAP is thought to underlie chromaffin cell secretion during stress. This has
prompted us to posit that with increased splanchnic firing frequencies that produce facilitation, PLC activity in
chromaffin cells must be “turned on” to sustain increases in hormone output. Aim 3 builds on data which shows
that PACAP stimulates exocytosis in chromaffin cells, but does so while paradoxically restricting the release of
peptide hormones packaged within a chromaffin granule. Relevant for the differential release of biogenic
amines and hormone peptides, we will characterize the properties of PACAP-stimulated fusion pores and
investigate mechanisms by which they are constrained. We expect these studies will provide a coherent
molecular and physiological framework for understanding how presynaptic activity, postsynaptic receptor-
coupled signaling pathways, and exocytosis are mechanistically linked to regulate the stress response."
10790009,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Depression in late life is prevalent, affects nearly one fifth of older adults, and exacts an enormous burden on
public health. One hallmark of late-life depression is a loss in the ability to experience pleasure and reduced
motivation to seek rewarding experiences. Loss of pleasure and motivation limits engagement in activities that
could improve physical and mental health, leads to social isolation, and increases risk of suicide and early
mortality. These devastating impairments in reward function are also notoriously difficult to detect and treat,
due in part to a limited understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to impaired reward function. Elevated
inflammation, which is closely linked to depression, has been implicated as a biological mechanism of reward
dysregulation in preclinical models. Translational work has shown that pro-inflammatory challenges, such as
endotoxin administration, also alter reward behavior and reward neurocircuitry in healthy human adults. Our
laboratory has extended this line of inquiry to older adults, and preliminary data show that endotoxin
administration reduces motivational behavior in non-depressed older adults with elevated, but not low, anxiety.
Anxiety is prevalent in older adults, a risk factor for depression, and increases vulnerability to inflammation-
induced negative mood; moreover, aging increases exposure to inflammation (e.g., higher susceptibility to
infection, chronic disease, inflammaging). As such, anxiety and inflammation are risk factors that may comprise
“two hits” to impair reward behavior in older adults. Yet, no studies have tested whether such behavioral effects
are driven by alterations in reward neurocircuitry to help clarify mechanistic pathways and identify intervention
targets. The objective of the current study is to use multilevel analysis of reward function and an experimental
design to test effects of experimentally induced inflammation on reward behavior (Aim 1) and reward
neurocircuitry (Aim 2) as a function of anxiety in older adults. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, inflammatory
challenge with endotoxin in older adults (60-80 y) with (n=40) and without (n=40) anxiety symptoms will
evaluate whether anxious older adults are especially vulnerable to inflammation-induced deficits in reward
function and should be prioritized for monitoring and intervention. Insights from multilevel analysis of reward
can be used to inform the development of precision-based and personalized medicine strategies for the
prevention and treatment of late-life depression. With the support of the K01 Award, I will use this study to
launch an independent research program that uses experimental methods to identify mechanisms of late-life
depression to improve health and well-being in older adults. To this end, I am seeking 1) advanced training in
experimental clinical trial methodology using the endotoxin model to accelerate my development as an
independent investigator; 2) acquisition of skills in neuroimaging techniques and data analysis to evaluate
neural mechanisms that may be sensitive to inflammation and drive aberrant behavior; and 3) expertise in late-
life anxiety to broaden my research program and test new conceptual models of reward deficits."
10785626,"Project Summary: Photoreceptor (PR) subtype patterning in the retina generates primate-specific
trichromatic color and high-acuity spatial vision. Networks of factors drive cells along poorly understood
developmental trajectories to reach terminal PR fates. Misspecification of PRs results in diseases causing
blindness. My central goal is to determine the mechanisms that specify PRs and how these change to
generate PR diversity among primates.
 PRs express light-sensitive proteins called opsins, which confer distinct functions. Short-wavelength
sensitive cones (S cones) express S-opsin, long/medium-wavelength sensitive cones (L/M cones) express
L/M-opsin, and dim light sensitive rods express Rhodopsin (Rho). In humans, opsin expression follows a
temporal order: S opsin, then L/M opsin, and lastly Rho. The Johnston Lab found that retinoic acid (RA) and
thyroid hormone (TH) signaling specify cone subtypes in human retinal organoids. Early, low TH and high
RA signaling specify S cones. Later, high TH and low RA yields L/M cones. The mechanism by which TH
and RA signaling regulate PR development is unclear.
 Comparative developmental biology is a powerful approach for revealing general mechanisms of
development and how tweaking these mechanisms generates diversity between species. In contrast to
humans, the initiation of opsin expression in the marmoset is inverted: Rho, then L/M opsin, followed by S
opsin, suggesting that marmoset PR subtypes are born in a different order and/or mature at different rates
compared to human PRs. I developed primate retinal organoid technology and determined that opsin
expression in organoids recapitulates species-specific developmental patterns. I will genetically and
pharmacologically manipulate retinal organoids to compare mechanisms of PR specification between
primates and identify changes that diversify retinal patterning between species.
 During the K99 phase, I will determine how TH and RA regulate PR subtype specification and
maturation in human and marmoset organoids. During the R00 phase, I will elucidate how TH and RA
signaling regulates the cell fate trajectories of human and marmoset PRs during development. I will identify
and validate candidate cis-regulatory changes that drive differences in PR specification, by knocking out
associated genes, reciprocally swapping putative divergent regulatory elements in stem cells, and assessing
effects in human and marmoset organoids. These comparative approaches will untangle the regulatory
networks underlying the divergence of PR development between primate species.
 My goal is to become a leader in the field of neuronal fate specification, with a focus on understanding
mechanisms of cell fate determination in primate retinal development. My mentoring team and the Johns
Hopkins University community will provide the ideal environment for achieving in this goal."
10797590,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Overview: 1.8 million people die of lung cancer each year across the globe. Immunotherapy, particularly using
immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has revolutionized lung cancer treatments over the last years projecting a
significant improvement in cancer prognosis; however, response rates of ICIs are only 15-25%, which is in part
due to the lower levels of functional immune cells and insufficient infiltration of immune cells into the tumor.
Furthermore, about 70% of patients with NSCLC receiving ICIs experience immunotherapy-related adverse
events (irAEs) (e.g., metabolic dysregulation, myalgia, and cardiopulmonary disease). An effective intervention
that can enhance treatment responses as well as ameliorate irAEs would be a significant advance in clinical care
for patients with NSCLC on ICIs. Exercise has been emerging as a novel approach that can enhance response
to immunotherapy and reduce irAEs. Exercise can increase the infiltration of neutrophils in the target cells and
circulating levels of T cells and NK cells as well as induce tumor angiogenesis in preclinical settings, which has
the potential to induce a better response to ICIs and cancer suppression. Furthermore, exercise is proven to be
feasible in patients with lung cancer and to increase cardiopulmonary/muscular fitness and metabolic regulation,
which also suggests the potential benefits of exercise to reduce irAEs. However, no exercise clinical studies, to
date, have been conducted in patients with lung cancer receiving ICIs. Also, it is unclear which exercise
prescription, particularly regarding exercise intensity, would yield better immunological and treatment-related
outcomes. Therefore, I propose multi-level clinical research where a pilot randomized clinical trial (K99) will
explore the preliminary efficacy and mechanisms of different exercise training on immune function, which will
inform a larger Phase II trial (R00) to examine the effects of exercise on immunotherapy response rate and irAEs.
Research Plan: The K99 study is a three-arm pilot randomized clinical trial that will compare high-intensity
interval training (HIIT) vs. moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) vs. usual care (UC) to explore the
preliminary efficacy of exercise on immune function (Aim 1) and provide a proof-of-concept of the mechanisms
by analyzing biomarkers of immune function, exercise-induced cytokines, and cancer progression (Aim 2). These
findings will inform the R00 study, which is a two-arm phase II randomized clinical trial to examine the effects of
exercise (most efficacious training from K99) on immune function (Aim 3a), tumor biomarkers (Aim 3b), and
immunotherapy response and irAEs (Aim 3c).
Career Development Plan: The proposed comprehensive and transdisciplinary training, involving coursework,
mentorship, research involvement, and seminars/meetings, will enable me to (1) obtain the fundamental
expertise necessary to comprehend the roles of exercise in lung cancer immunotherapy and (2) become an
independent researcher who will lead a research group to pioneer the field of ‘Exercise Immuno-Oncology’."
10797290,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a complex disorder that arises from the action of multiple genetic and
environmental risk factors with population cumulative risk approaching 1 in 300 children. The
disease process for T1D consists of initiation of an immune attack targeted to insulin secreting
beta cells in the islets, modifying, impairing, and (ultimately) destroying the beta cells. Genome-
wide association studies (GWAS), performed by ourselves and others, identified more than 100
chromosomal loci where there is significant, replicated evidence of association with T1D. As
shown by us in the Type 1 Diabetes Genetic Consortium ImmunoChip fine-mapping analysis,
and other studies, ~ 98-99% of T1D credible set of SNPs are in the non-coding region of the
genome and preferentially map in enhancer regions active in immune cells. The proposed study
is an ancillary research project of the Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young
(TEDDY) study. TEDDY was designed to discover environmental triggers of T1D in a
prospective cohort of newborns at genetic risk, followed multiple times per year with collection of
samples for deep phenotypic and biomarker profiling. This project will utilize longitudinal
samples and their rich demographic, genetic, and immune markers collected on TEDDY
participants. We will use single-cell sequencing technology to monitor immune markers at the
protein and transcription levels to generate profiles for different stages of islet autoimmunity. To
gain a comprehensive understanding of the T1D risk genes that function in initiation and
progression of islet autoimmunity, we propose to apply single-cell sequencing to map T1D risk
variants that alter gene expression in circulating immune cells; we will use immune cell-surface
markers for cell type identification and examine immune profiles at initiation and progression to
T1D. To identify biological pathways, that T1D genes function in, we will construct a reference
co-expression network and refine predicted gene-gene interactions with Bayesian networks."

Columbia and Cornell, situated on the west and east side of Manhattan, respectively, will form the two hubs, supported by an Acute Treatment Sub-network of 3 hospitals in Brooklyn and New Jersey, a Recovery Sub-network comprising 2 affiliated academic Rehabilitation Centers in Westchester County and New Jersey, and 4 Academic Medical Centers in Brooklyn and in Western New York. Our hubs and satellites treated just over 8,700 strokes in 2022. More importantly, our RCC has an extensive leadership record in stroke clinical trials, and have the distinction of being the leading enroller in Stroke clinical trials over the first 5 years of Stroke Net; Our total enrollment as of November 2022 was 775 subjects, including the trials rolling into Stroke Net from prior years. The demographics in our network overall are very favorable for enrolling underserved minority populations: Columbia has 40% Hispanic and 25% African American; Cornell 15% Asian, and St. Joseph’s 24% African American, 30% Hispanic, 12% other. Part of our success is due to the highly organized and interactive infrastructure. We hold monthly videoconferences attended by PIs and coordinators from all RCC hubs and satellite sites, and standardized daily stroke admission screening across the RCC. These data as well as trial enrollments are reviewed at the monthly videoconference calls. In addition to our contributions in clinical trial enrollment, the STNCC has been extremely active in leadership roles in the first 10 years. Dr. Randolph Marshall and Dr. Dana Leifer have been regular members of the Stroke Net Steering Committee for 10 years. Dr. Marshall served on the NCC Executive Committee for years 1 and 2. He is also Chair of the Education and Training Core, having served as Co-Chair for 7 years prior. Dr. Ron Lazar (now at UAB), served on the Recovery Working Group in years 1 and 2, and was succeeded by Dr. Marshall, later joined by Co-I Dr. Tomoko Kitago in 2021. Dr. Connolly served on the neurosurgical advisory group. We have had 100% participation at all national meetings and conference calls. In terms of innovation and clinical trial development, our RCC has the distinction of submitting and obtaining funding for two of the Stroke Net RCTs. STNCC Co-Is Mitchell Elkind and Hooman Kamel are Co-PI’s on the ARCADIA trial, a multi-center Phase 3 RCT to determine whether apixaban is superior to standard therapy for patients with cryptogenic stroke and “atrial cardiopathy.” Randolph Marshall, Sander Connolly, and Ronald Lazar are Co-PI’s on the CREST-H study, an ancillary study to the CREST-2 trial, testing the hypothesis that revascularization can improve cognition in as subset of patients with high grade asymptomatic carotid stenosis who have cerebral hemodynamic failure. Finally, our Stroke Net trainee program has been highly successful, with 11 trainees producing 22 abstracts and 58 manuscripts within 1 year of Fellowship, and 10 have Assistant Professor positions at major academic institutions (all Stroke Net sites). Two have had for K-awards and 2 have R01s."

This proposal outlines a two-year research training plan to provide the applicant the technical skills, experience
with both in vivo and in vitro models, and analytic skills necessary for earning a K08 award on alveolar
epithelial repair mechanisms and fibrotic responses following lung injury.
Research Plan: Interstitial lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remain a major source of
morbidity and mortality worldwide, and available therapies are limited in their efficacy - despite decades of
research, clinical management revolves around supportive care, avoidance of further injurious stimuli, and lung
transplantation in select cases. Our lab made the seminal discovery that after injury, progenitor cells proliferate
and pass through a distinct transitional cell state during regeneration of alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells. This state is
transient during physiologic regeneration but appears to persist in non-resolving injury, suggesting that
persistence of the transitional state may be a key defect contributing to disordered repair and fibrosis. This
transitional state activates TGF-β signaling pathways known to be involved in IPF pathogenesis and exhibits
markers of cellular senescence. Senescence is a state of cell cycle arrest which has been strongly implicated
in the pathogenesis of IPF and other fibrotic lung diseases. However, the mechanisms by which these
transitional cells acquire senescence remain unknown. Cellular communication network factor 1 (CCN1, also
known as Cyr61) is a secreted matricellular protein that is highly upregulated in the transitional state and
known to mediate senescence in other tissues. Some evidence suggests that its function is profibrotic in lung
injury. However, the mechanisms that regulate its expression in transitional epithelial cells and by which it
promotes fibrosis are unknown. This proposal seeks to examine the effects of CCN1 on transitional state
senescence and the regulation of CCN1 by TGF-β signaling. I hypothesize that in the transitional state, CCN1
is driven by TGF-β signaling and promotes transitional cell senescence. In Aim 1, we will assess whether
CCN1 induces senescence using murine models of bleomycin-induced lung injury. To test this in vivo, we will
use RNA interference-based and genetic strategies to knock down CCN1 in lung epithelial cells. In vitro, we
will use primary murine alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell culture assays to understand the mechanisms by which
CCN1 affects transitional cell senescence. In Aim 2, we will inhibit TGF-β signaling by multiple methods in vitro
to understand whether and how CCN1 expression is regulated by canonical TGF-β signaling. We will validate
our findings in vivo using TGF-β receptor loss-of-function in the bleomycin model. We will validate key in vitro
experiments in both aims in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived AT2 cells and in fixed tissue
from IPF patients."
10820805,"Project Summary/Abstract
Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in women in the United States, and the population of breast cancer
survivors (BCS) is growing. Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is the most common long term side effect of breast
cancer disease and treatment. CRF is associated with poorer quality of life and decreased physical and
psychological well-being. Therefore, identifying strategies to manage CRF for breast cancer survivorship is
critical. Strong evidence indicates increased physical activity participation is associated with lower CRF levels in
BCS and effects are superior to pharmacologic intervention. Therefore, physical activity is recommended as the
first-line treatment for CRF. However, most BCS do not meet physical activity guidelines and elevated CRF is
associated with lower physical activity levels in BCS. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions may be a promising
intervention delivery tool for BCS with CRF because of their increased convenience, flexibility, and scalability
potential, and decreased burden. However, no existing mHealth physical activity interventions have specifically
targeted BCS with CRF. The purpose of this study is to use the preparation phase of the Multiphase Optimization
Strategy (MOST) to explore the effects of different physical activity promotion intervention components in BCS
with CRF, and better understand the multi-level intervention component preferences for this population to inform
future intervention development. This project will include secondary quantitative data analyses from the
Fit2Thrive study, an mHealth physical activity intervention for BCS that used the optimization phase of MOST.
Analyses will explore whether feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, and physical activity outcomes varied in the
subgroup of BCS participants with elevated CRF. Next, a needs assessment (questionnaires and semi-
structured interviews) will assess multi-level stakeholders’ (BCS with fatigue, experts, and community partners)
perceived barriers and facilitators of mHealth physical activity intervention uptake in BCS with CRF. This
fellowship offers a significant training opportunity in mHealth behavioral intervention design and dissemination,
and quantitative and qualitative data analysis. The proposed aims will create an evidence-based foundation for
the design and development of future mHealth physical activity interventions for BCS with CRF to promote health
and well-being throughout survivorship."
10822647,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The gastrointestinal tract is colonized with trillions of normally beneficial microbes, termed the microbiota, that
are essential for human health. However, the pathogenesis of numerous infectious, inflammatory, and
metabolic diseases involves a loss of immunologic tolerance to the gut microbiota. This has been
demonstrated robustly in basic, translational, and clinical studies of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The
fundamental focus of our proposed renewal for R01AI123368 is to build on recent paradigm-shifting
results from the first funding cycle that detailed a novel pathway that is essential to orchestrate
immune tolerance to gut microbiota and restrain intestinal inflammation. Specifically, our prior studies
detailed how group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) present microbiota-derived antigens to CD4 T cells on
MHCII, instruct the differentiation of a unique form of RORgt+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), and prevent
spontaneous intestinal inflammation. Further, we find that these cellular interactions are dysregulated in the
inflamed intestine of individuals with IBD (see Zhou et al., Nature, 2022 and Lyu et al., Nature, 2022 as the
most recent examples). We generated new preliminary data to support this renewal application where we
propose to mechanistically advance this paradigm and will explore the therapeutic potential of our key findings.
This includes three specific aims, which will: (i) define how ILC3s sense microbiota to initiative antigen
presentation, (ii) elucidate key molecular determinants endowing a tolerogenic program in MHCII+ ILC3s, and
(iii) identify whether MHCII+ ILC3s can be harnessed to enforce tolerance to diverse microbes or restrain gut
inflammation as a pre-clinical therapy. We will employ basic mouse models, as well as translate our findings
into human specimens. This research is directly relevant to IBD and many other chronic inflammatory diseases
where disruptions to immune tolerance underlie disease pathogenesis, and it is expected that our mechanistic
results will provoke new opportunities for preventative, therapeutic or curative treatment strategies."
10822574,"PROJECT SUMMARY
To overcome the “undruggable” protein problem, researchers have turn to drugging mRNAs that
translate into these undruggable proteins or non-coding RNAs that regulate the biogenesis of
these proteins. Avenues of controlling RNA degradation include induced proximity degradation or
splicing modulated nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Induced proximity degradation is a strategy
where a bifunctional drug binds a target RNA via a small molecule (SM) entity on one arm and
induces selective RNA degradation via a ribonuclease on the other arm. Therapeutic modulation
of NMD via RNA splicing is another strategy to selectively control RNA degradation. Early-stage
RNA degradation drug discovery has been hindered by current high-throughput screening (HTS)
assay technologies designed for protein targets. Specifically, cell-based drug screens use
minigene reporters that rely on luciferase or fluorescent protein signals for assay read-out.
Minigene reporter design is straightforward but minigene reporter requires mRNA export to the
cytosol and protein translation. This significantly increases the rate of false hits per screen since
compounds that inhibit global protein translation machinery or RNA export will also impact
reporter read-out. Further, protein-based reporters cannot be used to study nuclear RNA or non-
coding RNA turnover, and in diseases with nuclear export defects. Thus, there is an unmet need
for a cell-based HTS assay platform that monitors selected RNA turnover directly, reflects real-
time RNA dynamics, and compatible for different types of RNA. A prime example where a
previously intractable disease can be unlocked by RNA degrading drugs is the G4C2
hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene – the most frequent genetic cause of
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). It is now known that the
toxic gain-of-function from the expanded G4C2 repeats induces ALS/FTD pathology. Antisense
oligonucleotides (ASOs) designed to bind either the G4C2 sequences or intronic regions
downstream of the repeat sequences showed reduction in disease phenotypes in C9orf72 models.
However, ASOs can trigger immune responses and suffer from tissue delivery issues. A cell-
based assay that can report expanded transcript turnover to identify effective C9orf72 RNA gain-
of-function SM inhibitors will have high commercial potential. The goals of this Phase I SBIR
application will be cell-based RNA degradation reporters for validated RNA targets in
neurodegenerative diseases. The results will form the foundation of an HTS assay platform for
early-stage discovery SMs that modulate RNA stability."
10822618,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Severe allergic diseases afflict an increasingly large population and significantly impact the patients' quality
of life. Approximately 25 million Americans suffer from asthma; 5-10% from severe or uncontrolled asthma.
Around 32 million Americans have food allergies; 8%, or 5.6 million, are children. An estimated 0.5% to 5% of
adults and 1.8% of children live with chronic urticaria. There are currently no cures for severe allergic diseases.
High-dose corticosteroids are traditionally used to manage symptoms but are associated with significant side
effects. While antibodies targeting mediators of allergic responses have recently emerged as alternatives, life-
long administration is required. Progress has been made in oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy but
treatment is not without significant adverse events, and it does not negate continued food avoidance after a
five- to nine-month dose escalation course of treatment. Therefore, novel approaches that can achieve long-
term suppression of symptoms with a single treatment are urgently needed.
 Recent decades have seen the successful development of T cells engrafted with chimeric antigen
receptors (CAR T cells) for treating hematologic malignancies, where the CAR directs T cells to recognize and
kill cancer cells. Importantly, a single infusion has been shown to result in the persistence of functional CAR T
cells for more than 10 years. Thanks to intensive research efforts from academia and the pharmaceutical
industry, the safety profile of CAR T cells is continuously improving, and the cost of manufacturing is expected
to drop significantly. As the result, CAR T cell therapy is being actively developed for non-cancer diseases
such as autoimmune diseases.
 We have developed two innovative CAR T cell designs that are capable of efficiently and specifically killing
B cells producing IgE, the key mediator of allergic immune responses. The results, however, were all obtained
from in vitro experiments using cultured cells. In this Phase I project, we propose to determine the potency of
CAR T cells in immunocompromised mouse models that are relatively straightforward to establish. Specifically,
we will determine the ability of CAR T cells to eliminate IgE-producing human U266 myeloma cells in NSG
mice (Aim 1), and to eliminate IgE-producing primary human B cells in PBMC-NSG mouse models.
 Data from this project will pave the way for a phase II study that tests the potency as well as the toxicity of
our CAR T cells in more physiological settings, including immunocompetent or humanized mouse models. Our
long-term goal is to develop a safe and cost-effective CAR T cell therapy that can achieve long-term (years to
decades) suppression of allergic symptoms, or even a cure for severe allergic diseases, with a single
treatment."

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of RNAs that hold immense potential as therapeutics due to
their unique cellular functions. However, the challenges associated with their synthesis and purification have
impeded their research and development. Chimerna proposes to develop a platform technology using yeast
to manufacture high-quality circRNAs for use in research, therapeutics, and diagnostics. The proposed
technology builds upon Chimerna's Tornado technology for expressing RNAs as a circle in cells. When
used in E. coli, the Tornado technology results in the production of RNA at high levels not previously seen
with conventional linear RNAs. The stability of circular RNA allows it to accumulate to high levels in E. coli,
and also confers high stability in vitro and when transfected into mammalian cells, thus mitigating the
persistent degradation problem of conventional linear RNAs. The project also utilizes a proprietary affinity
tag that is encoded into the circRNA making downstream purification easier. This technology resolves key
problems associated with current circular RNA synthesis methods that use in vitro transcription for
production. However, production of circRNA in E. coli results in high levels of LPS, which is difficult to
remove and not acceptable for therapeutic indications. The current proposal aims to engineer a yeast strain
capable of producing circRNAs at high yields. Unlike bacteria, yeast do not contain LPS, which is difficult to
remove in downstream purification applications. Moreover, yeast has been extensively used for
manufacturing many bioactive compounds such as proteins and lipids. This makes yeast an ideal organism
in which to develop a circRNA manufacturing platform. The specific aims of the project are: (1) - To
engineer a yeast strain that can be induced to express circular RNA at high yields: This aim involves
engineering multiple yeast strains to produce circRNAs and testing their yield under various inducible
promoters. The yeast strain will be further optimized by introducing RNA processing enzymes required for
maximum circularization efficiency; (2) To benchmark circRNA manufacturing to existing manufacturing
technologies: The second aim of the project involves comparing the yield and cost per gram of RNA
produced in yeast versus traditional IVT. The researchers will also examine protein expression and RNA
half-life from a circular mRNA versus a linear mRNA for total protein output in mammalian cells. Finally, they
will measure inflammatory responses to transfected circRNAs versus linear mRNAs. Taken together, the
development of a yeast manufacturing platform for synthesizing circRNAs holds immense promise for the
production of this highly important type of RNA. The proposed technology will greatly reduce the cost of
producing circRNAs while also simplifying the purification and downstream processing. This new
manufacturing platform will accelerate the entry of circRNAs for medical use, thereby advancing the field of
RNA therapeutics."

 Large data sets are routinely collected in biomedical research. Analyzing such datasets often requires
coding, which can be challenging and time-consuming for researchers without computational expertise.
Capitalizing on recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), we developed a prototype of RTutor.ai, a
website and a R package that enables users to ""chat"" with their data in dozens of natural languages. Under
a reactive programming environment, we use OpenAI's ChatGPT to translate users' requests into R or
Python code, which is then executed alongside user-uploaded data to produce results instantaneously. By
integrating prompt engineering, code generation, execution, and reporting, RTutor enables people without
coding experience to conduct preliminary analysis and visualization while boosting productivity for others by
providing candidate code for further refinement. Despite limited features, the current version has been used
by thousands of researchers world wild.
 This project aims to fully develop the prototype and rigorously test and document its capacities and
limitations. Specific Aim 1: Develop and enhance RTutor. Based on our experience developing large
bioinformatics apps such as iDEP and ShinyGO, we will (1) optimize prompts for effective and robust code
generation, (2) upgrade to GPT-4 for better performance and improved code generation through
conversations, (3) handle multiple datasets, (4) improve user interface, (5) automate exploratory data
analysis, and (6) develop a customized version with built-in datasets and prompt structures for business
customers. Specific aim 2: Test, evaluate and document. (1) Unit and system testing, usability testing by
user groups with or without coding experiences, (2) systematic testing for limitations and robustness in
biomedical data analysis, (3) test the applicability in various bioinformatics tasks such as RNA-Seq data, (4)
document through text and video, (5) outreach to user communities.
 The completion of this project will lead to the development of an AI-powered virtual assistant for statistical
computing. Like Amazon Alexa in our homes, its abilities might be limited but it can be made freely available
to all scientists across the world, partially mitigating the shortage of experienced statisticians and
bioinformaticians. RTutor has immense potential to accelerate scientific discovery and improve healthcare
outcomes by enabling more researchers, especially those with limited resources, to gain insights from large
datasets."

The overall goal of this Phase I SBIR project is to expand the capabilities of tools, invented by the founders of
Potentiometric Probe, LLC, for high-fidelity optical recording of electrical activity in cardiac cells, tissues, and
whole hearts. Potentiometric Probes develops organic voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) that convert the changes
in voltage across cell membranes to visible changes in fluorescence. Instead of individual electrodes, this
technology enables the use of sensitive high-speed cameras, where each pixel can be considered an
electrode, for massively parallel high throughput screening, or for high-resolution spatiotemporal maps of
electrical signal propagation. Importantly, our VSDs are unique in enabling dual-wavelength ratiometric
recording of electrical activity; this is particularly important for cardiac studies because it eliminates
contraction-induced motion artifacts, permitting high-fidelity records of the action potential waveform. Human
stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are human skin or other cells that are “reprogrammed” to be
beating heart cells in a dish. These human cells and the tissues derived from them are increasingly being used
for research and development purposes, including screening new drugs for cardiotoxicity, and in the future may
be used for “personalized medicine” and the analysis of patient-derived cells. We believe high throughput
recording of accurate action potential waveforms from hiPSC-CMs and tissues will be a major market for the
proposed technology. While these cells beat spontaneously, pacing or stimulating these cells to beat at specific
frequencies is a critical part of screening protocols because electrical activity and the contribution of specific
ion channels is highly dependent on beat frequency. This external stimulation can be applied using light and
researchers have incorporated light-dependent channel rhodopsins to conveniently achieve the desired pacing.
However, it is crucial to separate the spectra of light used for optical voltage imaging and stimulation.
Preliminary work shows that a new chromophore developed at our company can extend the wavelength of our
VSDs to the near-infrared and allow them to be used to their full potential, including ratiometric imaging, in
concert with channel rhodopsins for pacing. In this proposal, Potentiometric Probes will synthesize a set of
near-infrared VSDs and will characterize their performance in cells including hiPSC-CMs. Ultimately, the
technology may allow much greater flexibility to researchers, enable multiplexed imaging experiments not
previously possible, and in the future may also be applied clinically for high-resolution imaging of action
potential propagation in the heart."

The parathyroid hormone (PTH)-related protein (PTHrP) is essential for mammary gland development, placental
calcium ion transport, tooth eruption, bone formation and remodeling, and causes hypercalcemia in patients with
malignancy. Our current understanding of how endogenous PTHrP (PTHrP1-141) transduces signals through the
PTH type 1 receptor (PTHR), a Class B G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), is largely based on studies done
with its N-terminal fragment (PTHrP1-36). However, pilot studies revealed that signaling properties of endogenous
PTHrP are distinct from its N-terminal fragment and dependent on heparin/heparan sulfate, a glycosaminoglycan
(GAG). The role of extracellular matrix components, such as GAGs, in PTHR signaling and trafficking has largely
been ignored. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to determine the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which
heparan sulfate controls PTHrP signaling via PTHR. We hypothesize that the interaction between
heparin/heparan sulfate and PTHrP maintains local concentrations of the hormone at the cell surface, which
enhances the rate of receptor binding and ligand residence time on PTHR, and consequently contributes to
location biased signaling mediated by PTHrP. The first Aim will address this hypothesis by characterizing the
binding properties of PTHrP and heparin/heparan sulfate interaction using biophysical approaches. The second
Aim will employ single-cell and single-molecule optical imaging approaches to determine the functional role of
heparin/heparan sulfate and the mechanism by which PTHrP signals via PTHR. The findings of this proposal will
provide insight into the ligand biased signaling mechanism of PTHR, and contribute to the overall understanding
of GPCR signaling beyond the field of pharmacology."

More than 60 million Americans consume acetaminophen (APAP) on a weekly basis.
Unfortunately, an overdose of APAP causes liver toxicity and is responsible for over half of acute
liver failure cases in the US. N-acetyl cysteine is the only antidote for APAP overdose and is
effective if given within 10 hours after APAP ingestion. However, many patients don’t seek out
treatment during the therapeutic window for N-acetyl cystine. Currently, a liver transplant is the
only available treatment option for these late-presenting patients. APAP toxicity is a leading cause
for liver transplantation in the US and worldwide.
The goal of this SBIR phase II project is to develop an anti-inflammatory synthetic heparan sulfate
oligosaccharide, GLY-202, for APAP overdose patients specifically late-presenting patients. GLY-
202 was selected after compound optimization studies in efforts to identify a smaller, easier to
synthesize oligosaccharide with in vivo efficacy compared to 18-mer in the APAPoverdose model.
Unlike 18-mer, the synthesis of GLY-202 can be achieved in a shorter synthetic route,
substantially decreasing the production cost and reducing a significant commercialization barrier.
This phase II period will focus on IND-enabling studies including GLY-202 drug substance
chemical, manufacturing and control (CMC) activities (Aim 1), pharmacology (Aim 2) and toxicity
studies (Aim 3). Execution of the proposed aims will demonstrate synthetic scalability and
reproducibility in pilot production scale and efficacy and safety through pharmacology and toxicity
studies. During the phase II period, Glycan Therapeutics will submit an Orphan Drug Designation
application. Benefits of Orphan Drug status include significant financial benefits through fee
waivers and tax credits for clinical expenses. Furthermore, the clinical trial recruitment will be
comparatively small meaning that the amount of GLY-202 required can be sufficiently prepared
by Glycan Therapeutics. In the phase IIb studies, we will complete GMP manufacturing,
formulation, submit IND application and conduct Phase 1 clinical trials. The success of this project
will provide a new approach to treat drug induced liver toxicity by targeting to HMGB1-mediated
inflammation with a first-in-class therapeutic."

Radiation therapy (RT) has a proven record of efficacy in treating many forms of pediatric brain tumors. However,
it is associated with long-term side effects due to damage to surrounding healthy tissue. This is especially
important in the pediatric developing brain, where long-term deficits can be seen in cognitive development. To
mitigate these deficits, there has been a shift from whole brain irradiation to more targeted treatment by using
dose painting intensity modulated radiation therapy. However, to use these techniques, more information is
needed about how giving radiation to normal brain structures, called organs-at-risk (OARs) affects outcomes,
both in terms of brain anatomy and function.
Voxel Healthcare LLC (VH) is the developer of ClickBrain – an automatic pediatric MR brain segmentation tool
that uses cloud-based deep learning (Google TensorFlow) technology for radiology clinical decision support.
Since the inception of this software, we extended ClickBrain to ClickBrain RT – a system that will combine
ClickBrain’s pretreatment brain structure segmentation outputs with radiation planning computed tomography
(CTs) and/or magnetic resonance (MRs) imaging to calculate dose to OARs. ClickBrain RT also segments
longitudinal MRIs to track outcomes via volumetric changes. In previous projects, we correlated input parameters
such as OAR dosing, demographics, tumor type and grade, OAR and tumor volumetric measurements to OAR
volumetric outcomes, using a database of brain MRIs from germ cell tumor patients. Here in Aim 1a, we will
modify our prediction using a hybrid deep learning and machine learning method for the prediction of treatment
outcomes for OAR. We will also be improving our autosegment algorithms. The tumor images extracted from
MRI and CT images will be concatenated with the patient specific demographic information (age and gender) for
the training of a hybrid neural network architecture. Imaging features will be sent to an autoencoder convolutional
neural network (CNN), while the demographic information will be sent to a densely connected multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) network. After individual feature extraction and reshaping, they will be concatenated and sent
to a MLP model for treatment late cognitive effects prediction. Missing data points will be synthesized using a
modified Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) method. 3. In Aim 1b, we will build on our current
interface prototype, which uses clinical and demographic variables (age, chemotherapy dose, tumor type, grade
and location) and baseline imaging as input and outputs predicted outcomes for OARs. We will upgrade the
interface to provide full functionality and compatibility with existing commercial software for ease of porting files
between systems. Our extended validation in Aim 2 will focus on an existing large database from a broad range
of brain tumor patients acquired as part of standard-of-care and previous studies at Children’s Hospital Los
Angeles. Our long-term goal for ClickBrain RT is to train the machine learning algorithm to provide optimized
recommended OAR dosage ranges based on patient history and tumor information. Our software will allow
radiation oncologists to optimize treatment and vastly improve long-term quality of life in pediatric brain tumor
survivors."

The nucleolus is one of the largest membraneless cellular organelles, responsible for ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
transcription, rRNA processing, and ribosome assembly. Nucleolar size and number are often correlated with
protein synthesis rate and proliferative capacity of a cell. Seminal studies have shown that increased nucleolar
size and number are common features of many cancers and that nucleolar defects are associated with
neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Nevertheless, fundamental
information is still lacking on the molecular players and mechanism that control the dynamic assembly and
activity of the nucleolus in health and disease.
We identified a novel nucleolar protein named ZNF692 that is necessary to maintain nucleolar integrity and
activity. Knocking down ZNF692 resulted in abnormal ring-like nucleolar morphology, as well as compromised
protein synthesis. Our preliminary results indicate that ZNF692 interacts with multiple nucleolar proteins,
including NPM1, as well as rRNA processing and ribosome assembly factors. Our hypothesis is that ZNF692
assembles a hub for ribosome biogenesis in the nucleolus by simultaneously recruiting pre-rRNA, ribosomal
proteins, and ribosome biogenesis factors. We will define the molecular mechanism regulated by ZNF692 in
ribosome production (Aim 1). We will define the domains of ZNF692 that regulate nucleolar integrity and activity
(Aim 2). We will then determine how ZNF692 may regulate nucleolar assembly and dynamics (Aim 3). Our work
has the potential to provide fundamental data on the mechanisms and key regulators of nucleolar activity and
could become the basis for the development of novel approaches to alter nucleolar activity in diseased cells."

An ongoing revolution in microscopy has revealed previously inaccessible aspects of signaling. These include
organization of signaling proteins on dynamic cytoskeletal elements, subtle but important variations in
activation kinetics, and information encoded in the oscillation frequencies of signaling circuits. We will explore
these regulatory mechanisms by developing novel approaches to visualize and control protein activity, and by
using them together in the same cell. Novel image analysis methods and computational modeling applied to
multiplexed imaging data will reveal causal connections between signaling events, including those dependent
on nested feedback loops. We will pursue new methods to produce biosensors bright enough to study the
conformational changes of individual molecules in living cells. On podosomes and adhesion complexes, where
important dynamic structures are organized on a scale below the diffraction limit, we will use these new
methods to examine the opening of stretch-activated binding sites in real time. Proteins will be controlled with
light or small molecules using engineered domains inserted away from the active site, where they can
allosterically control activity without perturbing normal interactions. We will study three model systems that are
well suited to extract basic principles re the spatio-temporal regulation of signaling: 1) In 'frustrated
phagocytosis' macrophages attempt to engulf micropatterned circles. The phagocytic apparatus they build
around the circles has precise, reproducible geometry, which will enable us to use quantitative image analysis
and simultaneous protein control/visualization to develop mathematical models. 2) We will study how cancer
cells move on aligned collagen ""superhighways"" to find blood vessels. There we will ask how cells use
localized signaling to sense and respond to anisotropic mechanical stresses. 3) Finally, cell
protrusion/retraction will be used to examine the integration of chemical gradients, mechanical force, and
cytoskeletal dynamics. We hope that the behavior of these model systems will reveal ubiquitous signaling
mechanisms, and that the new tools can help others explore diverse questions in cell biology."

 Historically, data on Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHPI) have been
aggregated with Asians thereby masking disparities across this diverse group. Recent
disaggregation of NHPIs in health data sets, such as the National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS) in the United States (US), indicate that NHPI health disparities continue to exist. The
NHIS excludes the US territories and affiliated Pacific Islands where non-communicable
diseases (NCD) have been declared a health emergency. One NCD, common yet understudied in
the US Affiliated Pacific Islands (USAPI), is gout sometimes resulting from hyperuricemia.
NHPIs in the US experience a higher burden of gout and hyperuricemia. Furthermore, half-
century old data suggest differences in gout and hyperuricemia among populations in the
USAPIs, but the data needs updating. In partnership with the University of Michigan, the
University of Guam proposes two specific aims to: 1) establish a Micronesian Data Laboratory at
the University of Guam, and 2) conduct the first Guam NHIS with a representative probability
sample of 500 households of adults and adolescents in Guam with an emphasis on measuring
gout and hyperuricemia prevalence. The Micronesian Data Laboratory will occur in Years 1 and
2 and require identifying and equipping the physical space, as well as forming a Steering
Committee working with community partners. The research approach in Years 3 to 5 will entail
the Guam NHIS preparation (sampling frame design, finalization of instruments, interviewer
training), implementation (household recruitment and interviews), and analysis and
dissemination of findings. Throughout the project, the research team will engage the Steering
Committee and community partners – a process that may identify novel alternative approaches
to enhance research implementation in the COVID-19 era sustainable through our Micronesian
Data Laboratory. The inaugural GNHIS findings will inform policy or program needs to support
population health, generate future collaborative grant proposals, and serve as a model for other
territories or USAPIs interested in NHIS or similar survey implementation."
10807979,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Restoration of craniofacial soft tissues is a major challenge in reconstructive surgery. Soft tissue losses from
congenital facial differences, oncologic resection, trauma, and inflammatory diseases affect millions of patients
each year. Current solutions to facial soft tissue losses – both autologous and prosthetic-based – suffer from
serious limitations. Autologous solutions such as tissue flaps and lipotransfer are hampered by donor site defects
and unpredictable survival, often necessitating repeated operations to achieve adequate restoration. By contrast,
prosthetic solutions such as hydrogel fillers or polyester implants are plagued by limited volume and duration of
restoration, and by fibrosis, device exposure, and infection respectively. There is a critical need for an engineered,
off-the-shelf solution that immediately restores missing soft tissue volume while encouraging natural soft tissue
development and remodeling over time. Such an approach to creating well integrated, vascularized soft tissue
would greatly decrease the burden of care for craniofacial patients. We recently created a biostimulatory
nanofiber-hydrogel composite (NHC), comprised of chemically defined polyester nanofiber and hyaluronic acid
(HA) hydrogel components, that is capable of inducing host cell infiltration, pro-regenerative conditioning of tissue
responses, and progressive remodeling of the injection site into vascularized soft tissue. Our long-term goal is
to use NHC in conjunction with the patient’s own cells as a regenerative cell therapy for craniofacial soft tissue
defects. The overall objective for this proposed study is to engineer NHC with high biostimulatory activity
coupled with allogeneic cells and define the materials properties and cellular responses governing soft tissue
remodeling in genetically tractable and established translational models. In Specific Aim 1, we will engineer
optimized nanofiber-hydrogel composites (NHC) as biostimulatory matrices to promote immunomodulation,
angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling and define their structure-function relationships. In Specific Aim 2, we will
examine the potentiation effects of adipogenic progenitor cells on host cell infiltration and conditioning,
angiogenesis, and soft tissue remodeling when co-delivered with biostimulatory NHC. In Specific Aim 3, we will
demonstrate soft tissue remodeling capacity in a larger volume preclinical model in rabbits using an optimized
combination of biostimulatory NHC and adipose progenitor cells. This study will yield a new series of off-the-
shelf biostimulatory NHC matrices capable of remodeling into vascularized soft tissue, elucidate the underlining
mechanisms by defining the interplay between biomaterials, autologous cells, and host tissue responses, and
offer insights into future clinical utility. The proposed biomaterials and autologous cell approach to craniofacial
soft tissue restoration promises to significantly improve clinical outcomes – minimizing morbidity, reducing cost,
and expanding accessibility to treatment."

Antibiotic overuse in hospitalized patients is common and leads to adverse events, such as
increased antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infection. Antibiotics prescribed at
hospital discharge account for up to half of antibiotic use related to hospitalization and are often
unnecessary. For infections such as urinary tract infection and pneumonia, the majority of
antibiotics prescribed at discharge are written by hospitalists. Thus, engaging this group of
providers is needed to improve antibiotic use at discharge.
The long-term goal of this career development award is to promote the candidate's development
into an independently funded physician-scientist with expertise in improving appropriate use of
medical therapies. Using antibiotics prescribed at hospital discharge as a model for this work, this
project aims to: 1) assess the drivers of antibiotic overuse at hospital discharge, 2) examine
barriers to and facilitators of appropriate antibiotic treatment at discharge, and 3) develop and
pilot a behavioral intervention to improve appropriate use of antibiotics at hospital discharge.
Successful completion of this work will substantially impact patient care and ensure the
candidate's future success through acquisition of critical skills and content expertise in reducing
medical overuse at discharge. Finally, this work fits with AHRQ's research priority area #1 of
conducting research to improve health care patient safety and with AHRQ's interest in combating
healthcare-associated infections and antibiotic resistance.
The candidate will pursue a mentored research plan that promotes development of expertise in:
1) multilevel methods to evaluate the relative contributions of patient and organization-level
effects on provider decisions such as antibiotic prescribing; 2) qualitative research methods to
better understand prescribing practices; and 3) designing and evaluating provider-facing
behavioral interventions to influence prescribing practices. The career development plan consists
of a multidisciplinary team of experienced mentors and advisors who will oversee a range of
formal coursework and practical experiences to ensure the candidates' success. Exceptional
resources and a mentoring team with proven success in developing junior physician-scientists
make the University of Michigan an ideal environment for this proposal."

This career development award will establish me (Dr. Estelle Everett MD, MHS), as an independent
investigator focused on evaluating and addressing disparities in management and outcomes in vulnerable
patient populations with type 1 diabetes (T1D). This K23 award will provide the support I need to develop
expertise in three key areas: 1) EMR-based retrospective data analysis and natural language processing
(NLP) methods, 2) clinical trial design, implementation, and analysis, and 3) qualitative study development,
data collection and analysis.
After receiving my medical and research training in at Johns Hopkins and publishing a series of general
diabetes papers, my research interests have increasingly focused on patients with poorly controlled T1D. I
am committed to improving care and outcomes in this complex group of patients whose long duration of T1D
increases their risk of developing complications early in their lifetime. Although diabetes technology has
revolutionized T1D management, disparities in technology access are evident among racial-ethnic minorities,
patients with lower socioeconomic status and those with poorly controlled T1D.
To help address these gaps, it is critical to leverage electronic health record (EHR) data to readily identify
patients experiencing diabetes technology disparities. In order to examine whether diabetes technology can
reduce diabetes care burdens and enhance outcomes among some of highest need patients, we need to
expand diabetes technology clinical trials beyond the very select populations included thus far (ie., mostly
White, higher SES). Therefore, I propose to: 1) To develop and validate a novel electronic medical record
(EMR) algorithm using natural language processing (NLP) to identify insulin pump and/or CGM use among
patients with type 1 diabetes; 2) To perform a pilot RCT of hybrid closed-loop insulin pump therapy (HCL) in
40 diverse adult patients with poorly controlled T1D (HbA1c >9%) from the largest academic and safety net
health systems in the Los Angeles region; and 3) To identify facilitators and barriers of effective use of
closed loop insulin pump therapy in patients with poorly controlled T1D. Findings from Aim 1 can be readily
used to support T1D care in other settings and findings from Aims 2 and 3 will also be used to inform a future
RCT as part of a future NIDDK R01 application. This K23 award will provide the support to complete these
aims and my educational objectives, which will provide me with the training and skills needed to become a
national leader and independent clinician-investigator aimed to improve outcomes in vulnerable populations
with T1D."
10809624,"Obesity and diabetes rates continue to rise, and racial and gender disparities persist. 23% of
women gain ≥ 20 kg through young adulthood, which is associated with development of
diabetes and greater mortality. Because many women experience pregnancy, excessive
gestational weight gain (GWG) and post-partum weight retention (PPWR) are potentially
modifiable contributors to future obesity and diabetes in both women and their children. The aim
of this R-18 Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is to test the effectiveness of
Healthy for Two / Healthy for You (H42/H4U), an innovative evidence-based
pregnancy/postpartum health coaching intervention that is remotely-delivered (phone coaching
+ web-based platform + mobile phone behavioral tracking), aimed at promoting healthy GWG
and postpartum weight loss. We will embed H42/H4U into prenatal care clinics that serve a
racially and economically diverse population, leverage existing staff as trained health coaches
and community health workers, and test its effectiveness and implementation in a pragmatic
RCT. We aim to 1) Compare the effectiveness of the H42/H4U remotely-delivered health
coaching intervention integrated into prenatal care compared with Usual Care among 380
pregnant and postpartum women enrolled from 6 prenatal clinics and; 2) Assess organizational
factors that impact the implementation of the intervention into prenatal care clinics, including
costs of intervention delivery and provider and staff satisfaction to inform future dissemination.
The primary outcome will be GWG. Maternal and infant secondary outcomes include excess
GWG, GDM incidence, PPWR, infant birth weight and at 4 and 6 months, maternal health
behaviors (diet, physical activity, breastfeeding) and maternal wellness (depression, sleep,
stress). This study will advance a potentially powerful, prenatal care-based strategy to reduce
obesity in childbearing women and thereby the intergenerational effects on their children. Our
team brings together academic and community-based obstetricians, a population health
program, and researchers with experience in developing, testing and implementing behavioral
interventions in both pregnant and non-pregnant adults in real world settings to enable wide
dissemination. Ultimately, we aim to reduce obesity, diabetes and other obesity-related
complications in mothers and their children, and ensure high quality care delivery that prevents
obesity and diabetes through a population health approach to prenatal care."
10807554,"SUMMARY
We discovered that MLLT3 is a key regulator of human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal but its
expression declines in culture. Strikingly, maintaining MLLT3 levels in cultured cord blood (CB) HSCs results in
expansion of transplantable HSCs without transformation or differentiation bias. How MLLT3 dictates
physiological HSC self-renewal without transforming them to leukemic state, became a major question. We
discovered that MLLT3 locus in human HSPCs has a second active TSS linked to hitherto unreported short
MLLT3 isoform (MLLT3-S). MLLT3-S encodes a truncated protein that retains the AHD domain responsible for
protein-protein interactions but lacks the chromatin binding YEATS domain. Overexpressed MLLT3-S can
interact with known MLLT3 protein partners such as DOT1L and superelongation complex but cannot bind
chromatin. While MLLT3-L OE in CB HSCs promoted their expansion, MLLT3-S OE suppressed it, implying
distinct functions for the two isoforms in HSCs. Conversely, knockdown (KD) of MLLT3-L in CB HSCs triggered
premature differentiation, whereas MLLT3-S KD resulted in relative expansion of immunophenotypic HSCs,
although they engrafted poorly in immunodeficient mice, showing that both isoforms of MLLT3 are necessary for
proper HSC function. scRNA and bulk RNA seq of HSPCs with MLLT3-L and/or MLLT3-S OE and KD revealed
that the two isoforms have opposing effects on expression of key HSC processes, such as mitochondrial
biosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation, translation, as well as several HSC transcriptional regulators. We
discovered that, while MLLT3-L is expressed already in hemogenic endothelium in the embryo, MLLT3-S is
induced in maturing fetal liver HSCs and represses fetal programs in HSCs, implying that MLLT3-S may promote
HSC maturation in the fetal liver and their transition to homeostatic state. We have identified several candidate
enhancers in MLLT3 gene that link to either the long or short isoform. Interestingly, building on our discovery
that there are two major isoforms of MLLT3 that are transcribed from the two TSS, correlation of our various
sequencing data with current Gencode and Ensembl annotations suggests that both MLLT3-L and MLLT3-S
may have less frequent subvariants. These potential sub-variants are likely generated by alternative splicing and
may lead to dysfunctional proteins or non-translated transcripts, suggesting potential complementary
mechanisms by which the function of MLLT3 isoforms can be dampened or modulated. We will now examine
the mechanisms by which the interplay between long and short isoforms of MLLT3 in human HSCs regulate
HSC maturation and the balance between expansion and maintenance modes by 1) mapping the expression of
MLLT3-L and S (and their prevalent sub-variants, if present), and their associated regulatory elements
throughout human HSC ontogeny, by 2) determining functional effects of MLLT3 long and short isoforms (and
their sub-variants) on human HSC maturation and fate decisions, and by 3) examining how the interplay between
MLLT3 isoform variants and distinct protein partners regulates human HSC maturation and fate choice."

Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and fatal disease with limited therapies. IPF patient lungs
display hallmarks of accelerated aging, including overabundance of senescent cells. In particular, senescent
lung fibroblasts (sLFs) are key drivers of lung fibrosis. However, the signaling mechanisms that promote sLF
accumulation and persistence in lung fibrosis remain poorly understood. This proposal seeks to fill these gaps
with mechanistic studies that will enhance our capabilities to clear sLFs in IPF. Flavonoids are naturally
occurring molecules which show potential to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Their rise to prominence
in recent years has been driven by the discovery that several of these compounds are can selectively induce
apoptosis in senescent cells. In order to develop a better tool to investigate sLFs we designed and synthesized
a novel, potent, senolytic flavonoid (F-4N). We present preliminary data shows that F-4N promotes
senescence clearance and resolution of lung fibrosis in bleomycin-injured, aged mice with chronic fibrosis. We
further observed F-4N selectively inhibits NF-κB signaling in sLFs without affecting resident pulmonary
leukocytes. NF-κB activation is a hallmark of senescent cells, however its role in their apoptosis-resistance has
not been explored, and senescence-unique mechanisms for targeting NF-κB have not been identified. NF-κB is
critical for host defense, and systemic inhibition has very limited application. Based on these observations we
propose to test the central hypothesis that sLF apoptosis resistance depends on NF-κB activity and clearance
of sLFs with F-4N represents a viable strategy to treat IPF. This hypothesis will be tested with three specific
aims: First, we will establish the molecular mechanism of action essential to F-4N senolytic activity. We will
perform apoptosis quantification, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq from cultured sLFs to identify changes in response
to gain and loss-of-function studies. We will use proteomic analyses to identify global phosphorylation changes
in sLFs under these conditions. Second, we will characterize the cellular specific impact of F-4N on NF-κB
activity and apoptosis by quantifying the effect of F-4N across fibroblast, epithelial, endothelial, and leukocyte
populations after acute administration to mice with bleomycin induced lung fibrosis. We will culture in vivo-
derived low and high NF-κB activity fibroblasts and epithelial cells in a 3D co-culture model to investigate
paracrine signaling and senescence propagation. Lastly, will determine the antifibrotic efficacy of F-4N in
chronic experimental fibrosis using one-time bleomycin lung injury in aged mice (18 months) and repeated
bleomycin injury in young mice (2 months). F-4N will be benchmarked against the antifibrotic efficacy of
pirfenidone and nintedanib, and previously established senolytic strategies. We will also measure the
clearance of senescence burden and collagen deposition in precision-cut lung slice (PCLS) ex vivo cultures
derived from IPF patient lungs. Together these proposed studies will enhance our understanding of the
molecular and cellular mechanisms essential to sLF accumulation and persistence."
10797151,"Project Summary/Abstract
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease that impacts approximately 2.3 million people world-
wide. MS is caused by the activation and the complex interactions between different immune cell types that
cause inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS), which leads to demyelination and axonal degeneration.
A validated animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), has been
utilized to demonstrate that the cognate interactions between CD4+ T cells and monocyte-derived cells (MDCs),
defined here a mixed population of dendritic cells and macrophages differentiated from monocytes during the
autoimmune-driven neuroinflammation, are required for the pathogenesis of EAE. The overall goal of this
proposal is to identify signaling pathways and their downstream effector mediators that regulate the interactions
of CD4+ T cells and MDCs within CNS that promote the pathogenesis of EAE. Signal transducers and activators
of transcription 5A and 5B (STAT5A and STAT5B) play a critical role in mediating cellular responses following
stimulation of cytokines, interferons, growth factors. The activated STAT5 proteins can form dimers and
tetramers. The biological functions of STAT5 tetramers are not fully understood. Using a Stat5a-Stat5b N-domain
double knock-in (DKI) mouse strain, in which STAT5 tetramers cannot be formed but STAT5 dimers are
unaffected, we found that STAT5 tetramers promote the pathogenesis of EAE. The mild EAE phenotype in DKI
mice correlates with reduced interactions of CD4+ T cells and monocytes/MDCs in the spinal cord meninges
during EAE. We further demonstrated that STAT5 tetramer activation by cytokine GM-CSF promotes monocyte
differentiation into dendritic cells and the expression of chemokine CCL17. Correspondingly, the expression of
CCL17 in the spinal cords is significantly reduced in DKI mice during EAE. Importantly, mice receiving STAT5
tetramer-deficient Th17 cells treated with CCL17 developed more severe EAE with earlier onset of the disease
compared with mice receiving cells without CCL17 treatment. Our central hypothesis is that GM-CSF-mediated
STAT5 tetramerization is critical for facilitating the interactions of pathogenic Th17 cells and monocytes/MDCs
in the spinal cord meninges via a CCL17-dependent mechanism, and these cell interactions are required to
promote the pathogenesis of EAE. We will test our hypothesis in three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will utilize
different EAE induction strategies to determine the pathogenic role of STAT5 tetramers in Th17 cells and
monocytes/MDCs during EAE. In Aim 2, we will test our hypothesis that STAT5 tetramer signaling promotes
monocyte differentiation and Th17 cell-MDC interactions at the spinal cord meninges during EAE using intravital
imaging technique. In Aim 3, we will investigate the mechanism by which CCL17 promotes the pathogenesis of
EAE. Specifically, we will test our hypothesis that CCL17 increases the affinity of integrin VLA-4 on Th17 cells,
thereby facilitates Th17 cell-MDC interactions. Targeting the pathways and mediators that control the interactions
between CD4+ T cells and MDCs within CNS may become a novel strategy for the treatments of MS."

Inhibitors of the mTOR pathway are among the most promising interventions to target age-related
dysfunction, however, there is a critical need to further define the pro longevity effects to facilitate clinical
development of mTOR inhibitors. The current proposal will significantly advance this effort providing new
targets for intervention and novel markers to monitor individual responses to mTOR inhibition. The
overarching goal of this research program is to develop a mechanistic understanding of novel downstream
targets of rapamycin, in order to facilitate safer and more effective strategies to promote healthy aging.
Cellular senescence occurs in both somatic and stem cell populations and contributes to age-related
dysfunction, and our laboratory has shown that mTOR inhibition using rapamycin, can prevent entry into the
senescent state. The mTOR pathway also regulates senescence a n d pluripotency in a variety of stem cell
populations. The central hypothesis of the application is that mTOR inhibition by rapamycin prevents
senescence and enhances pluripotency by increasing the lncRNA H19. The rationale for this hypothesis is
our observation that rapamycin increases levels of the non- coding RNA (lncRNA) H19. We find that levels of
H19 decrease during senescence and in pluripotent cells. H19 plays a central role during development and
differentiation, and maintenance of adult stem cell populations. Rapamycin increases H19 levels, prevents
senescence and maintains pluripotency. The results suggest that increasing H19 levels in response to mTOR
inhibition may play a dual role, inhibiting senescence while simultaneously increasing pluripotency in adult
stem cell populations. The proposed work will provide transformative data regarding a novel mechanism for
lifespan extension and improvement of late-life function in multiple tissues."
10809844,"ABSTRACT. A critical need exists to enhance the clinician-investigator workforce and cultivate the next
generation of clinician-investigators to pursue heart, lung, blood, and sleep research across the spectrum from
basic/pre-clinical to clinical medicine. While many trainees express an interest in research during residency
training, clinical demands limit opportunities to engage in meaningful, longitudinal investigations and acquire the
fundamental skillsets that build the foundation of a clinician-investigator career. The overarching goal of the
Pittsburgh Innovation in Collaborative Training of Residents Alliance, or PICTOR Alliance program, is to recruit,
retain, and accelerate independence of a pool of resident-investigators to perform basic translational and clinical
translational research using a highly integrative approach that draws upon the experience of a diverse group of
established investigators focused on heart, lung, blood, and sleep research. The PICTOR alliance program will
leverage existing mechanisms to recruit, select, and train the next generation of clinician-investigators within the
Medicine, Pathology, Pediatrics, and Surgery departments at the University of Pittsburgh while developing an
innovative, formalized structured program that integrates the four departments with the specific goal of training
resident-investigators. Up to four outstanding residents per year will be selected to participate in either a basic
translational or clinical translational track that will consist of an initial immersion in concentrated coursework
designed to provide exposure to fundamental areas of life-science or biostatistics, followed by mentored research
with tailored methodology training. As learning is a continuous pursuit through the lifetime of a career, PICTOR
will include self-reflection, peer observation, and team building opportunities for resident-investigators through
the creation of a central hub for peer exchange of ideas, team problem-solving and support, with the ultimate
objective of promoting resilience and capacity for continued growth. A strong foundation of basic translational
and clinical translational research exists at the University of Pittsburgh and the four departments have a rich
history in training clinician-investigators in areas reflective of the NHLBI mission. Cross-disciplinary interactions
will be promoted at the time of recruitment, through the stages of research immersion, and following the
dedicated training period of one to two years. The four departments will likewise collaborate at the organizational
level to provide supervision of the mentored experience to assess research competencies and milestones for
resident-investigators. PICTOR alliance is an immersive structured program that promotes diversity of science
and representation with the ultimate objective of transitioning promising young resident-investigators to individual
career development research awards."

translational endeavors and to excel in team science. Unlike traditional T32s, our selection of trainees is not
constrained by discipline, graduate programs, or disease focus. Building on varied research backgrounds of
trainees, we incorporate experiences to foster emergence of new interdisciplinary teams—which is proving
effective. Pre- and postdoctoral trainees are selected by competitive review from a demographically diverse
pool of applicants. Training is individually tailored in the context of structured mentorship and progress is
carefully monitored by the PI (Hartmann) and Co-Director (Edwards). Activities include interdisciplinary mentor
panel meetings, work-in-progress groups, Bench-to-Bedside Rounds, near-peer mentoring, writing workshops,
and pragmatic career development seminars. This program will serve 10 TL1 trainees, seven pre-doctoral and
three postdoctoral, for up to five and three years respectively. In addition to conducting mentored research as
part of an established transdisciplinary team and pursuing their academic course of studies if applicable,
trainees will craft Pathways that combine 42 contact hours (not credits) of didactic, intensive, and experiential
learning. These are anchored in eight key areas: Biostatistics & Epidemiology, Data Sciences, Clinical Context
(for non-clinical scholars), Learning Healthcare System, Measurement Methods, Sex & Gender Biology,
Technology Transfer & Innovation, or Race, Ethnicity, Disadvantage & Health. Individualized components of
pathways build key translational competencies, yet are flexible and allow extensive individual tailoring to best
match prior training and future career directions of the trainee. Our program benefits from integration within a
CTSA hub in a medical center that ranks 11th in overall NIH funding, values and achieves diversity, conducts
cutting-edge research, provides top-flight graduate education, and has strong synergy across the TL1 and KL2
awards. We provide trainees an abundance of research cores and unique models for expert guidance like
Studios, Biostatistics Clinics, REDCap Data Management courses, a library of funded grants, internal study
sections, and much more. Tools are in place to evaluate both trainees and mentors over time and to
continuously enhance the program. Oversight is provided by an Advisory Committee and external site visitors.
We work extensively with other CTSAs and have built collaborative resources shared nationally. In summary,
we foster excellence to inspire careers dedicated to interdisciplinary translational science and to prepare future
leaders of high performing scientific teams."

Breast cancer (BrCa) is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in women and the majority of
mortality is due to metastatic BrCa disease. Although our understanding and treatment of advanced breast
cancer has improved, the 5-year survival rate remains at a dismal 22%. Two-thirds of all BrCa is positive for
estrogen receptor (ESR1, ER), which can be exploited by targeted anti-estrogen therapeutics. Unfortunately,
25% of ER-positive primary disease patients and nearly all ER-positive metastatic BrCa patients will go on to
develop treatment refractory disease to these targeted regimens. ER is a prominent component of cancer
progression; thus, it is imperative to understand how advance ER-positive patients confer treatment resistance.
The Lee-Oesterreich lab recently discovered a novel genomic alternation to ESR1, an in-frame translocation
event creating a fusion gene product. A subsequent panel of ESR1 fusions have been discovered and these
ESR1 fusions are estimated to be prevalent in at least 1-5% of advanced ER-positive BrCa disease.
Importantly, these fusions were identified in patients who developed resistance to hormonal therapy.
The functional role of these genomic fusion genes requires further investigation. We will investigate how ESR1
fusions influence cellular proliferation, treatment insensitivity and migration/invasion. Our preliminary data of a
fusion stably expressed in a BrCa cell line exhibited enhanced growth and lack of response to hormonal
treatment. We will also analyze transcriptional and mechanistic changes invoked by ESR1 fusion expression.
Preliminary data of ESR1 fusions transiently transfected into a BrCa cell line exhibited enhanced ER activation
compared to parental and wildtype ER expressing cells. Direct mutagenesis of the fusion partner will better
elucidate the contribution of ESR1 or the fusion partner to global cellular changes. Lastly, we will study the
prevalence of the fusion genes in metastatic refractory disease to determine clinical significance. We will
analyze exosomal RNA isolated from patient blood draws to detect presence of known and novel fusions.
This proposal will ultimately 1) better analyze the metastatic properties of ESR1 fusions both in the presence
and absence of treatment, 2) gain a greater appreciation of ESR1 fusion influence on the transcriptome and
cistrome and lastly 3) define fusion prevalence in advance BrCa and detection of novel fusions over the course
of a controlled clinical trial utilizing anti-estrogen treatment. Successful completion of these Aims will help
inform clinicians and researchers the clinical relevance of ESR1 fusions and if these genomic alternations can
serve as biomarkers for identifying treatment resistant breast cancer and rationale for alternative treatment
strategies."

 Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is used in excess as a preservative and flavor enhancement in processed
foods. Accordingly, 25% US adult consume Pi at 3-4 fold higher than the recommended daily allowance on a
regular basis. While the impact of dietary Pi excess in the setting of chronic kidney disease has been well-
studied, its impact on human health in the general population remains incompletely understood. Our recent
study in mice demonstrated that dietary Pi loading that mimic the level of US adult consumption leads to
reduced spontaneous locomotor activity, exercise capacity, and reduced resting metabolic rate when in normal
mice by impairing skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and fat oxidation. These metabolic changes were
related to downregulation of numerous genes involved in fatty acid release, transport, and oxidation.
Furthermore, our pilot study from the third examination of the Dallas Heart Study (DHS-3) provided support for
the animal data as a robust association between higher dietary Pi intake and lower in vivo mitochondrial
function using 7-Tesla 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy and oxygen uptake during exercise was
observed. More importantly, an association between higher dietary Pi intake and markers of insulin resistance,
including higher liver and muscle fat content was uncovered. Therefore, we propose an ancillary study to the
already funded 3rd examination of the DHS to test the impact of dietary Pi excess on physical activity and
cardiorespiratory fitness. We will also conduct a randomized crossover study to determine if this
phosphotoxicity on the muscle mitochondrial function and exercise capacity is restored by lowering dietary Pi
content, which is independent of total energy intake and other nutritional components. The proposed
translational studies in otherwise healthy humans have the potential to shift current clinical practice paradigms
by identifying phosphate as a key modifiable cardiometabolic risk factor in the general population."

This proposal is for a five-year research career development program, focused on understanding how
“neutropenic inflammation” activates the endothelium toward programmed cell death and the protective role of
necrotic cell death protein receptor interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3) in this inflammatory environment. The
candidate has been appointed Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine. This
proposal is a natural extension of the candidate's previous research in high vascular injury ARDS populations
(Price DR, AJRCCM, 2021; ICM, 2021) and vascular cell death work in ARDS (Price DR, Am J Patho, 2023). It
outlines a plan for the candidate to achieve his goal of becoming an expert in vascular biology and acute lung
injury, extending the training of the candidate as identified here and reflected in the mentorship of Dr. Augustine
Choi and Dr. Shahin Rafii: 1. Define the role of neutropenic inflammation in mouse lung injury and human
organoid models, and 2. Determine a functional role for RIPK3 in inflammatory acute lung injury, and 3. Define
important necrotic cell death and vascular injury biomarkers in inflammatory ARDS. The proposed experiments
and the exciting training plan will impart the candidate with a unique combination of skills that will position him to
transition into a successful independent physician scientist studying vascular injury in ARDS.
The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common, often fatal, inflammatory lung injury for which
there are limited therapeutic options. The role of vascular injury as a disease-modifying factor in ARDS
pathogenesis has been well established. In contrast, the functional significance of an aberrantly injured vascular
cell upregulating necrotic cell death proteins, including receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3), remains
largely unexplored in ARDS investigations, representing a potential target for future ARDS therapeutics. In this
proposal, I leverage my recent work highlighting neutropenic ARDS as a high endothelial stress population to
propose studies that test how excessive “neutropenic inflammation” activates the endothelium toward
programmed cell death and the protective role of endothelial RIPK3 in this inflammatory environment. To do this,
I have developed a neutropenic lung injury model that activates the lung endothelium and promotes RIPK3
expression. In Aim1, we will define the role of neutropenic inflammation in mouse lung injury and human organoid
models. In Aim 2, we will determine a functional role for endothelial RIPK3 in acute lung injury using gene
targeted mice, specifically the endothelial cell-specific deletion of RIPK3 mice. And in Aim 3, we will characterize
dysregulated cell death and vascular permeability pathways in inflammatory ARDS by correlate circulating
necroptosis and vascular permeability proteins with mortality and clinical indices of acute lung injury. Collectively,
these studies will provide novel insight into pathways of neutropenic inflammation and endothelial RIPK3 in
regulating vascular injury in ARDS."

Trypanosoma brucei is a flagellated protozoan parasite responsible for sleeping sickness, a vector-borne
disease that causes great human suffering and economic burden and is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa. In
addition to its own medical importance, T. brucei represents a group of related human parasites. Because of
easy genetic manipulation, T. brucei is also a valuable model organism for studying flagellum/cilium biology. To
survive, be transmitted, and cause disease, T. brucei must sense and respond to environmental signals. This
is especially important for a vector-transmitted parasite, because it must respond to multiple host
environments. Sensing is achieved by signal transduction pathways that detect external changes and convert
these into cellular responses. Little is known about these pathways and mechanisms in T. brucei, or other
related pathogens – this is a critical knowledge gap and potential source of discovery of new treatments.
Cumulative evidence shows the T. brucei flagellum is a critical platform for cAMP signaling that controls cell
movement, cell-cell communication, chemotaxis, movement through tissues, transmission through the insect
vector and pathogenesis in the mammalian host. It has also been demonstrated that the flagellum tip is an
important domain for organizing cAMP signaling, and models hypothesize mechanisms for tight control over
cAMP distribution, retaining cAMP near sites of generation and downstream effectors. Surprisingly, however,
spatial arrangement of cAMP production and propagation has been directly examined. Moreover, almost
nothing is known about effectors in the flagellum that transmit cAMP effects. Thus, fundamental questions
regarding trypanosome cAMP signaling mechanisms remain unanswered. We are well-positioned to answer
these questions by employing our state-of-the-art quantitative tools for phosphoproteomics of flagellar
subdomains, functional signaling assays, and new tools for live imaging of cAMP fluctuations inside cells. Our
specific aims are to (1) identify and functionally characterize cAMP-effectors and (2) test hypotheses for
mechanisms of cAMP signal distribution and propagation through the flagellum. To identify proteins regulated
by cAMP (1a), we established a platform to obtain the cAMP-dependent phosphoproteome and we will use this
to find target proteins altered by cAMP. For functional analysis (1b), we will examine motility and signaling in
mutants lacking the proteins or phosphorylation sites identified in part (1a). This aim will provide novel insights
into the function of individual cAMP effectors as well as the broader role of phosphorylation as a mechanism of
transducing cAMP signaling in trypanosomes. To determine distribution of cAMP, we will visualize cAMP
fluctuations using a genetically encoded FRET sensor in live cells (2a). We will use this FRET-based system to
study propagation of the cAMP signal in response to external stimuli and test tenets of the current flagellum
microdomain cAMP signaling model (2b)."
10811211,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Altered lipid and glucose homeostasis in response to overnutrition is central to the pathogenesis of non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Because current management options remain limited, the discovery of
new metabolic pathways will serve to identify novel opportunities for intervention. This research proposal
addresses the unanswered question of how membrane lipids regulate nutrient homeostasis. Our long-term
goal is to understand the relationships between membranes and metabolic regulation and to leverage these
for therapeutic purposes. The objective of this research is to elucidate lipid-mediated regulation of acetyl-
CoA metabolism in health and overnutrition. Acyl-CoA thioesterase 12 (Acot12), which is highly expressed
in liver and intestine, is the enzyme responsible for the cytosolic conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetate plus
CoA. Acot12 comprises tandem N-terminal enzymatic domains and a C-terminal lipid-binding domain. The
central hypothesis is that Acot12 activity controls lipid and glucose homeostasis by limiting utilization of
acetyl-CoA for lipogenesis and for transcription factor acetylation. The rationale is that identifying the
molecular mechanisms that underlie this novel lipid-regulated pathway should reveal distinct new insights
into the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Guided by extensive preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested
in three specific aims: 1) To define mechanisms whereby Acot12 controls lipid and glucose metabolism in
liver; 2) To demonstrate key roles for Acot12 in intestinal lipid absorption and barrier function; and 3) To
elucidate the cellular and molecular determinants of Acot12 activity. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that
Acot12-mediated hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA limits substrate availability for lipogenesis and reduces
transcriptional expression of glycerolipid biosynthetic and gluconeogenic genes through acetylation of
transcriptional regulators. We will further examine whether reduced production of lysophosphatidic acid
functions to preserve Hippo signaling, thereby inhibiting hepatocarcinogenesis. Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that upregulation of intestinal Acot12 in response to overnutrition promotes glycerolipid
trafficking with enterocytes, as well as the assembly and assimilation of chylomicrons. We will further
investigate whether Acot12 maintains the barrier function of the intestinal epithelium in the setting of
overnutrition by reducing inflammation and necroptotic cell death, thereby preventing hepatic injury in the
setting of diet-induced steatosis. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that Acot12 localizes preferentially to the
cytoplasm or nucleus depending on metabolic conditions. We will define the lipid ligand(s) of Acot12 and
demonstrate how lipid binding regulates both cellular localization and enzymatic activity. Overall, this
proposal will elucidate new mechanisms of lipid-mediated metabolic regulation, which is significant because
membrane lipid composition varies in health and disease. These studies are expected to inform new
therapeutic strategies for the management of NAFLD."
10813773,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart failure (HF) is a devastating public health issue for America's aging population. It is the primary reason for
hospital admission for older adults, and HF hospitalization for older adult patients carries a much higher burden
of subsequent clinical events (rehospitalization and death) than it holds for younger patients. HF hospitalization
is also associated with concerning outcomes for family caregivers, particularly spouses/partners, who experience
higher degrees of caregiver strain (i.e. burden) and higher mortality risk after their loved one is hospitalized.
Given that worsening symptoms are the primary driver of HF hospitalizations, and timely symptom response is
critical for maintaining clinical stability, a major focus of research has been reducing HF readmissions by targeting
HF patient symptom monitoring and response. However, multiple large HF symptom monitoring trials have been
inconsistently successful in improving patient outcomes post-discharge. Moreover, these studies rarely include
family caregivers, despite the fact that caregivers play a major role in managing symptoms, and they themselves
experience poor health outcomes related to patient hospitalization. The overall scientific goal of this proposal is
to address this critical knowledge gap by examining how patients and their caregiving partners monitor symptoms
together, and testing the overall hypothesis that patients and caregivers who assess symptoms similarly, and
whose assessments accurately reflect changes in clinical stability, will have better symptom response and better
individual and dyadic outcomes. We will enroll 50 older adults hospitalized for HF and their caregiving
spouse/partner for a daily diary study of symptoms and clinical biomarkers of HF progression, and follow them
during the high risk post-discharge period (5 weeks). Leveraging intensive approaches for modeling dyadic
dynamics, we will: (1) Characterize agreement in patient and caregiver assessments of patient HF symptoms
during the post-discharge period; (2) Determine whether agreement in patient and caregiver HF symptom
assessments predicts patient event-risk, caregiver strain, and dyadic symptom response and health status; and
(3) Describe how patient and caregiver symptom assessments change in relation to clinical biomarkers of HF
congestion, and whether triangulating symptom assessments with clinical biomarkers identifies high risk dyadic
patterns of symptom monitoring. This proposed research will be conducted in a resource-rich environment, which
includes an NIH-funded Clinical and Translational Science Center and numerous other institutional and mentor
resources for conducting HF research in older adult couples. The execution of this study, coupled with a
comprehensive training plan (formal coursework, workshops, hands-on and immersion experiences, one-on-one
training), supports the career development goal of this award, which is to provide the Candidate with the skills
necessary (intensive dyadic longitudinal designs and analysis, integration of clinical biomarkers) to transition to
scientific independence and facilitate her long-term goal of developing a sustainable, innovative program of
research to improve the health of patients and caregivers as they manage HF together."

Sound decision-making about care during cognitive decline is a critical issue for the 5.8 million adults with
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) in the United States. Older adults (65 years and older)
with ADRD often are excluded from care decisions as their dementia worsens. Little is known about the
decision-making processes of older adults with ADRD concerning transitions from home-based care to long-
term dementia care (e.g. nursing homes, assisted living, and memory care units), or how to best incorporate
older adults with ADRD in the decision-making process. The goal of this research is to advance our
understanding of decision-making processes, and the preferences that influence decision-making, for older
adults with ADRD and their caregivers. This goal will be met through the following aims: 1) Define decision-
making processes and key factors influencing decision-making about transitions in care through qualitative
interviews with older adults with mild to moderate ADRD, caregivers, and dementia care providers to gain a
detailed understanding of the complexities of dementia care decision-making and related preferences. 2)
Develop a dementia care preference elicitation tool for use in assessing the preferences of older adults with
ADRD and their caregivers through novel application of discreet choice methodology in conjunction with
visualization methods and human-centered design to ensure that the tool is responsive to the needs of older
adults with ADRD. 3) Use developed and validated preference elicitation tool to ascertain preferences for
dementia care-related decisions among older adults with ADRD and caregivers. Over a two year period,
investigate the consistency of preferences regarding transitions in care among older adults with ADRD. The
proposed research forms the basis for investigating novel strategies to keep older adults with ADRD
meaningfully involved in decision-making, even as their dementia worsens."
10812076,"Project Summary (Abstract):
 Emerging and re-emerging respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and
avian and swine influenza viruses continue to pose a significant challenge to public health. These highly
pathogenic viruses successfully evade host immunity and replicate to high titers, causing excessive
inflammation, acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and fatal pneumonia.
However, the host and virus factors that facilitate impaired antiviral response and excessive inflammation
(dysregulated immunity) that lead to ALI and lung pathology are not known. In novel preliminary findings,
we identify that toll-like receptor (TLR)-extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 activity is central to SARS-
CoV-2 and viral-RNA-induced dysregulated lung immunity. Notably, blocking ERK1/2 activity not only
reduced SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory cytokine production but also enhanced antiviral IFN-I
response. Therefore, based on our strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that myeloid cell-intrinsic TLR-
ERK1/2 signaling promotes pathogenic lung inflammation and suppresses antiviral immunity. The primary
objective of the proposed study is to demonstrate the critical role of myeloid-cell TLR-ERK1/2 signaling in
SARS-CoV-2-induced dysregulated immunity, acute lung injury (ALI), and lung pathology, and to evaluate
the therapeutic potential of blocking ERK1/2 activity in suppressing lethal inflammation while enhancing
antiviral. We will define the role of myeloid cell-intrinsic TLR-ERK1/2 activity in SARS-CoV-2-induced lung
injury and pathology (Aim 1), demonstrate the role of myeloid cell intrinsic TLR-ERK1/2 activation in the
dysregulation of SARS-CoV-2-specific lung T cell response (Aim 2), and test the therapeutic potential of
blocking ERK1/2 signaling with or without antivirals in reducing lung injury and protecting mice from lethal
SARS-CoV-2 infection (Aim 3). The results obtained from this study will provide a foundation for identifying
specific targets to moderate lung inflammation and injury, which in combination with antivirals, can be used
to improve ALI, ARDS, and clinical outcomes."
10812762,"Understanding the interplay between sensory input, endogenous neural dynamics, and behavioral
output is key to understanding how the brain works at the level of neural computation. Hippocampal place
cells are an ideal system to investigate this closed-loop interaction, as they combine input from self-motion
cues and external landmarks to continuously update a dynamic neural network that creates an internal
representation of location on a cognitive map. The normal functioning of this system is critical for such
cognitive processes as flexible navigation, imagining the future, and autobiographical (episodic) memory.
 Animals can localize themselves by keeping track of their movements and continuously updating their
location on their cognitive map based on these movements—a process called “path integration.” In order for
this updating to coincide with the animal's actual displacement in the world, the relationship between
physical movement and position updating on the map must be fine-tuned. Previous work in a novel virtual-
reality environment demonstrated that external landmarks serve as a teaching signal to guide this fine-
tuning process through visual experience—a process called “path integration gain recalibration.”
 The present proposal seeks an in-depth understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms that drive
this previously unknown degree of plasticity in path integration dynamics, and how these mechanisms
support navigation. Attractor neural network models provide a compelling framework for understanding the
internal neural dynamic mechanisms underlying path integration. However, present versions of these
models do not capture the path-integration plasticity. Moreover, studying the nonlinear dynamics of how
visual inputs interact with the attractor network can provide important insights into how the brain creates
stable spatial representations that allow flexible solutions to spatial behavioral tasks. Principles and
analytical techniques of control-systems engineering will be applied to experiments that record the activity of
spatially tuned neurons from the hippocampus and related brain regions of rats to address a series of both
hypothesis-driven and discovery-driven aims: in Aims 1 and 2 we will investigate neurophysiological
mechanisms and behavioral consequences of the plasticity of the path integration computation and in Aims
3 and 4 we will investigate the signals (such as error signals) that underlie the interactions between
landmarks and path integration in the hippocampus that likely drive this plasticity. These experiments will
provide fundamental insight into how the brain computes representations of the spatiotemporal context of
an organism's experience, which is thought to constitute the framework that the brain uses to organize,
interrelate, and bind the various aspects of an experience and store them as a coherent memory. Such
insight will help understand how neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease and other
dementias, produce the devastating loss of cognitive function that is the hallmark of these diseases."

The study will investigate the neural mechanisms through which visual information is maintained in working
memory. The neural basis of working memory has been a matter of debate in recent years, with competing
theories proposing alternative neural correlates for its maintenance. Neurophysiological recordings will target
multiple subdivisions of the prefrontal cortex, a brain area implicated in working memory tasks, as well as the
anterior cingulate cortex, which has been implicated in learning to perform such tasks. Monkeys will be trained
in cognitive tasks that require them to observe and remember the identity of different visual objects, which can
be manipulated parametrically. A chronic array of microelectrodes will be implanted, and spike and local field
potential recordings will be acquired as the animals are trained to perform the working memory task, and as they
learn to perform the task with different stimulus sets. The experiment will allow us to determine the patterns of
neuronal activation that determine the behavioral performance in the task and adjudicate between competing
models. Analysis will determine changes at the level of single neurons, and neuronal populations, as well as
changes evident in the rhythmicity of local field potentials. The experiments will also uncover the nature of
changes that take place in the prefrontal cortex during training to perform an object working memory task and
uncover what aspects of neural activity are critical for task acquisition. Finally experiments will investigate the
flow of information within areas of the prefrontal cortex and between the prefrontal cortex and other cortical
areas. Collectively, these experiments will uncover the fundamental mechanisms through which the neural
circuits of the prefrontal cortex allow the maintenance of visual object information in working memory."

Aging drives regenerative and cognitive impairments in the adult brain increasing susceptibility to dementia-
related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, in healthy individuals. Evidence suggests
that exercise can counter age-related decline in regenerative capacity and cognition in the aged brain. The
ability to reverse brain aging through systemic interventions such as exercise could enable the mitigation of
vulnerability to age-related neurodegenerative diseases, fulfilling an unmet need that is growing more pressing
as the human population ages. Despite the evident benefit of exercise, its application is hindered in the elderly
by technical barriers, with evidence that perception of physical frailty or poor health alone can decrease
adherence. Therefore, it is critical to identify accessible therapeutic approaches that confer benefits of exercise
while circumventing pre-existing limitations. We and others have previously shown that systemic
manipulations, including heterochronic parabiosis (in which the circulatory system of a young and old animal
are joined) and young blood plasma administration, likewise enhance adult neurogenesis and cognition in aged
mice1,3,13. The rejuvenating effects observed with exercise mirror those of a youthful circulation, raising the
possibility that exercise similarly functions through blood factors to exert its beneficial effects. Indeed,
preliminary data from our lab demonstrate that systemic administration of blood plasma derived from exercised
mice reverses age-related impairments in adult neurogenesis and cognition in aged mice. The purpose of the
proposed study is thus to investigate the rejuvenating and therapeutic effects of exercise-induced blood factors
on the aged brain. Specifically, our hypothesis is that systemic exposure to exercise-induced blood factors
elicits long lasting rejuvenation of regenerative and cognitive functions, while ameliorating neurodegenerative
phenotypes. We will test this theory with Three Specific Aims: 1: Characterize the kinetics of brain rejuvenation
following systemic exposure to exercise-induced blood factors. 2: Investigate the role of the exercise-induced
blood factor Gpld1 in rejuvenating the aged brain. 3: Determine the therapeutic potential of exercise-induced
blood factors in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Successful completion of these studies will have
significant translational potential, identifying molecular and cellular pathways that could be targeted for novel
therapies to ameliorate dementia-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease."

TITLE: Maternal B cells enforce fetal tolerance
GOALS/OBJECTIVES: The overall goal of this five-year proposal for a Mentored Clinical Scientist Research
Career Development Award (K08) is for me to develop into a productive, independent academic investigator in
the field of reproductive immunology. My prior training has provided me expertise regarding T cell and antibody
mediated host defense. Through this proposal I will gain additional experience in B cell biology,
glycoimmunology and fetal tolerance. The long-term goal of this research is to improve pregnancy outcomes,
which will lead to healthier pregnancies and neonates. I graduated from the American Board of Pediatrics
Accelerated Research Pathway for Residency in General, and I completed my Fellowship in Neonatal-
Perinatal Medicine at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital (CCHMC). I joined the faculty of CCHMC and the
University of Cincinnati as an Attending Physician and Research Assistant Professor in the Division of
Neonatology. My mentor for this award, Dr. Sing Sing Way, is a physician-scientist with a longstanding track
record of scientific innovation and providing exceptional training to mentees at all levels. As an internationally
recognized expert in the immunology of pregnancy, microchimerism, commensalism and neonatal sepsis, Dr.
Way’s work highly complements my own. My mentorship committee brings needed expertise to the areas of
antigen-specific B cell responses (Dr. Justin Taylor), B cell interactions with N-linked glycans (Dr. Shiv Pillai),
placental immunology (Dr. Tamara Tilburgs), transgenic lymphocytes (Dr. Koichi Araki) and maternal-fetal
immunology (Dr. Hitesh Deshmukh). I am also extremely fortunate to have the unfettered support of CCHMC
and the Perinatal Institute, whose combined resources are unmatched.
Scientifically, this proposal focuses on deepening our understanding of mechanisms of fetal tolerance. The
field currently focuses on immune suppressive CD4+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) as the key mediators of
tolerance. This is based on observations that maternal Treg expand throughout pregnancy and are blunted in
pregnancy complications associated with fetal intolerance (e.g., preeclampsia, stillbirth). However, there is
growing appreciation that Treg do not work in isolation, and often require support from other cell types, including
regulatory B cells (Breg). Activation of B cells is tightly regulated by the inhibitory receptor CD22, which binds to
sialic acid present at the terminal position of certain glycoproteins. There remain numerous gaps in knowledge
regarding the role of maternal B cells in mediating fetal tolerance, factors affecting their activation, and
modification of fetal antigens. Additionally, whether these maternal B cells work independently or
synergistically with maternal Treg remains to be determined. My central hypothesis is that CD22 impairs
maternal B cell immune regulatory functions, preventing B cells from upholding fetal tolerance. This is based on
very interesting preliminary data showing that CD22 blockade reverses pregnancy complications and fetal loss
when maternal Treg are depleted or functionally impaired by infection. The aims of this proposal will establish:
1) how maternal B cell immune suppression is counter-regulated though antigen recognition and CD22, as well
as 2) how maternal B cells enforce fetal tolerance through IL10-mediated inhibition of maternal T cells with
fetal-specificity.
The scientific rigor of this proposal is supported by numerous career development objectives that will help
enable a transition to a successful independent research program. I will work closely with my mentor, Sing
Sing Way, and mentoring committee to gain expertise in reproductive immunology, fetal tolerance, spectral
flow cytometry, characterization of rare antigen-specific B cells, placental immunology, glycobiology and
genetic manipulation of antigen-specific B cells. Coursework, seminars, scientific conferences and hand-on
training in laboratories of collaborators/mentors will add additional layers of expertise. Overall, this mentored
career development award will broaden my scientific acumen to include reproductive immunology with a focus
on B cell biology and glycobiology. As pregnancy complications remain the leading cause of infant and
childhood mortality, results of these studies will potentially lead to novel B cell-directed therapies aimed at
improving outcomes for pregnant mothers and their children."

critical role in cortical processing. In particular, many thalamic nuclei, that together comprise the
majority of thalamic volume and that were previously mysterious in function, we now suggest are
critically involved in information flow and functional, dynamic binding between cortical areas via
cortico-thalamo-cortical pathways. We propose to study these pathways using the mouse
somatosensory system as the model involving both in vitro slice preparations and an in vivo
behaving preparation. It appears that, in many and perhaps all cases, cortical areas are connected
by both direct and these transthalamic pathways. The transthalamic pathways are only recently
appreciated, and we aim to explore some basic roles such pathways play in cortical processing. To
begin understanding the role of such pathways, we propose to probe basic circuit properties of
these pathways to better understand the role of the transthalamic pathways in higher cognitive
functioning."

 2 This K23 award will allow Ronnie M. Gravett, MD, to train under multidisciplinary, expert mentorship to become
 3 an independent patient-oriented outcomes researcher dedicated to improving the HIV outcomes affecting sexual
 4 minority persons in the Deep South. HIV disproportionately affects men who have sex with men (MSM) in the
 5 Deep South, a region in the United States with the highest burden of new HIV diagnoses. Pre-exposure
 6 prophylaxis (PrEP) effectively prevents HIV acquisition among MSM, but there is a significant lag in PrEP uptake
 7 and persistence in the Deep South when compared to other regions of the US. Barriers, such as systemic racism,
 8 stigma, and homonegativity, prevent MSM from adequately accessing and using this effective strategy. The high
 9 burden of HIV and inadequate PrEP uptake are NIH priorities that need novel strategies to address, such as
10 empowering and effective PrEP promotional strategies to increase PrEP uptake. Yet, there is a critical gap in
11 understanding HIV prevention messaging that is informed by the greater context of the intersecting identities and
12 known barriers to PrEP uptake among MSM in the Deep South. To address this gap, this project will examine
13 preferences for PrEP promotional messaging in order to create authentic and informative PrEP messages
14 through crowdsourcing, an innovative strategy wherein a group solves a common problem and the solution is
15 given back to the group. Integrating constructs of Andersen’s Behavioral Model of healthcare utilization and
16 community engagement into a human-centered design model will serve as the framework for this project. This
17 project will address the gap through the following specific aims: 1) explore preferences for PrEP messaging
18 content among MSM in the Deep South through qualitative interviews, 2) using a discrete choice experiment
19 (DCE), define the preferred attributes for PrEP messaging content to inform the format for the crowdsourcing
20 open call, and 3) compare MSM preferences for crowdsourced services to standard services to inform a digital
21 intervention designed to increase PrEP uptake among MSM in the Deep South. Crowdsourced content created

Stroke is a leading cause of disability and mortality with risk stratification based on socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity. The New York City Collaborative Regional Coordinating Center (NYCC-RCC) will unite three complementary research-intensive biomedical institutions (Einstein, NYU, Mount Sinai), three organizationally linked partners, and a network of high-volume clinical performance sites to further Stroke Net’s mission and to reduce the disproportionate burden of stroke in vulnerable and under-served populations. The NYCC-RCC has a record of leadership in community engagement and partnerships that will facilitate high-risk and under-studied patients’ enrollment in Stroke Net trials. The NYCC-RCC has significant expertise in the conception, development, and execution of clinical trials. The revamped NYCC-RCC will utilize a number of key design features to fulfill Stroke Net’s mission, including: 1) Organizational diversity through the integration of three leading academic health systems with targeted organizationally linked partners and clinical performance sites enhancing specific focus areas; 2) Recruitment and retention of underrepresented populations through com- munity engagement and strategic partnerships; 3) Focus on vulnerable pediatric stroke patients by integrating established pediatric stroke leadership with centers of excellence treating diseases known to confer high stroke risk; 4) Coordination of multiple high-volume thrombectomy centers to facilitate STEP platform enroll- ment; 5) Establishment of programs/infrastructure to facilitate hyper-acute stroke trial participation; 6) Comple- mentary, multidimensional MPI structure including an imbedded career development program; 7) A structured trial development process coupled with senior trialist guidance to generate a pipeline of Stroke Net trial sub- missions; 8) Pre-clinical expertise in evolving translational areas, including epigenetic and regenerative/stem cell therapeutic applications; 9) RCC connectivity via an advanced information technology and network perfor- mance group (IT/NPG). The NYCC-RCC will employ an integrated mentorship model to ensure career devel- opment of promising stroke investigators, including a structured education plan for StrokNet fellows utilizing the breadth and sophistication of our CTSA’s educational curriculums. The NYCC-RCC will train junior and mid-career investigators, as well as clinical research coordinators, toward productive careers in stroke re- search. In summary, the NYCC-RCC will leverage established clinical trials expertise with extensive scientific and organizational excellence to fulfill the Stroke Net’s mission. Therefore, this proposal seeks funding for an NIH Stroke Net – Regional Coordinating Stroke Center U24 – RFA-NS-23-010."
10797762,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are among the top candidates for cell therapy due to their
pluripotency and isogenic source. In case of skeletal muscle disorders, stem cell-based therapies can replace
defective or damaged muscle tissue with healthy muscle stem cells and progenitors. Therefore, hiPSCs have
been the focus of recent research for derivation of skeletal muscle progenitor cells (MPCs). However, cell
therapies are generally limited by poor cell survival due to lack of oxygen, nutrients and local trophic factors.
Meanwhile, endothelial cells (ECs) have a key role in regulation of muscle stem cells through secretion of trophic
factors controlling their activation, function and maturation. In addition, ECs directly contribute in angiogenesis
and formation of new vessels, improving local circulation. Indeed, coupled activation of MPCs and ECs supports
optimal muscle regeneration and plasticity after injuries or increased physiological demand. Therefore, ECs can
be considered as a potential adjunctive cell therapy to improve MPC survival and engraftment outcome in vivo.
Although the interaction between ECs and MPCs have been studied using primary cell lines and mouse models,
their possible cross-talk, underlying molecular mechanisms and their combined in vivo engraftment efficiency
has not been evaluated in a hiPSC-derived model system. Therefore, current application aims to: A) study the
effect of hiPSC-ECs on in vitro activity and function of their myogenic counterparts (hiPSC-MPCs) and to identify
and validate underlying mechanisms, and B) to evaluate the therapeutic efficiency of a combined hiPSC-EC+
MPC therapy in dystrophic or injury mouse models. In Aim1, hiPSC-ECs and MPCs will be grown using a
transwell co-culture system to allow paracrine interaction of the cells. The paracrine effect of ECs on MPCs will
be evaluated on cell proliferation, migration and differentiation using gene expression, transwell migration assay
and immunostaining methods. In addition, time-course RNA-Seq and secretome proteomics will be performed
to identify differentially expressed genes and proteins, such as ligands and receptor pairs, growth factors and
pathways. Top candidates will be validated by proteomics and over-expression/inhibition studies to validate their
role in the predicted cellular function. In Aim2, hiPSC-ECs and MPCs will be injected into muscle of dystrophic
or injury mouse models using different cell ratios and their in vivo survival and engraftment will be evaluated by
live cell bioluminescence, as well as histologic evaluation for donor cell engraftment into myofibers, muscle stem
cell and vessel compartment. Data will be quantified for engraftment and vascularization among different
experimental conditions to determine the efficiency and appropriate cell ratio of combined hiPSC-EC + MPC
therapy in the studied models. Completion of these studies will elucidate the role and underlying mechanisms of
hiPSC-EC/MPC interaction, as well as defining their combined in vivo efficiency to improve donor cell survival,
vascularization and engraftment in muscle disorders as a proof of principle study. Outcome of this study will
likely be able to move the field toward generation of multi-cellular hiPSC models for in vitro and in vivo studies."

 Obstructive sleep apnea is an extremely common condition that contributes independently to multiple
adverse outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. It is a major public health
problem given its high prevalence. OSA is heterogeneous, with established differences in symptoms and
outcomes in individuals with comparable disease severity based on traditional metrics. We were the first to show
that there are different symptom subtypes of OSA using unsupervised clustering analysis, including groups
defined by disturbed sleep with symptoms of insomnia, minimal symptoms, and marked excessive sleepiness.
The existence of these subtypes has since been replicated around the world in multiple population-based and
clinical cohorts. We have also shown that there are differences in outcomes between the these subtypes,
particularly for cardiovascular events and mortality, with increased risk in the excessively sleepy subtype.
However, there are still many unanswered questions. To begin to address these unanswered questions, we
propose to use data from the STAGES study, which recruited patients undergoing sleep studies across six sleep
centers in the United States and Canada. Participants had in-depth phenotyping that included: detailed
questionnaires about their sleep and health, depression and anxiety scores, actigraphy to assess sleep duration
over a 2-week period, psychomotor vigilance test to assess sleepiness objectively, and a comprehensive battery
of tests to assess cognition. In this project, we will first examine if there are differences in objectively-measured
sleepiness among the symptom subtypes, i.e., are individuals who complain of sleepiness also objectively
sleepy? We will also assess what role chronic insufficient sleep (based on actigraphy) and poor sleep quality
(based on a new measure of sleep depth—the Odds Ratio Product) play in determination of symptom subtypes.
Next, we will expand knowledge regarding the clinical relevance of these subtypes by evaluating differences in
neurocognitive outcomes. We hypothesize that the excessively sleepy group will have worse cognition than the
other groups, after controlling for key covariates. Finally, we hypothesize that objective data on sleepiness, sleep
duration, and sleep quality can be used to better understand additional heterogeneity among subjects with OSA.
Specifically, we will perform unsupervised clustering based on both subjective symptoms and objective
measures of sleepiness and sleep behavior (e.g., sleep duration and quality). We predict that we will identify
new subgroups of subjects and will assess whether there are larger differences in neurocognitive outcomes
among these subtypes when compared to subtypes defined only by subjective symptoms. The rich phenotype
data in STAGES allow us to address all of these important questions. Overall, this project is aimed at further
defining the heterogeneity of obstructive sleep apnea, an essential step in development of more personalized
approaches to diagnosis and management. Future directions for this study will include follow-up analyses in
other cohorts to validate the results and assess impact on other health outcomes."

The subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) has dominated the literature utilizing repetitive transcranial
magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to treat depression for good reason: treatment focusing on the frontal-sgACC
brain circuit is effective and changes in resting fMRI connectivity with the sgACC accompany symptom
improvements. However, it has not yet been proven that TMS actually engages the sgACC which would
support continued focus on this circuit at the exclusion of other potential targets from the fMRI literature. With
the application of interleaved TMS/fMRI, it is possible to capture brain responses caused by TMS to any brain
surface site. Using resting fMRI connectivity to guide TMS targeting, we seek to establish neuromodulation of
the sgACC pathway (R61, Aim 1) and the best connectivity pipeline for robustly engaging the sgACC (R61,
Aim 2). Upon establishing these successful benchmarks, the R33 phase will demonstrate that the sgACC
evoked response at baseline predicts depression improvement when treatment delivered to this same circuit
(R33, Aim1). To cement the relationship between modulation of the frontal-sgACC circuit with treatment and
depression improvement, we hypothesize an association between brain changes and clinical changes (R33,
Aim 2). We hypothesize that the R33 clinical associations with evoked brain responses will be established for
active but not for sham rTMS. Together, this research will elucidate basic mechanisms of rTMS treatment that
will accelerate brain circuit targeted neurotherapeutics."

 Hypertension (HTN), affects over 60% of US population above 60. It increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease
(AD) through compromised regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF). Multiple studies failed to establish that
lowering blood pressure (BP) entails consistent benefits for cognition and brain measures. This is probably due
to a preexisting compromise of the vascular system, which does not compensate properly for relative perfusion
pressure decrease caused by BP lowering. In a previous cycle, we showed that, in HTN, there is an optimal BP
level that maximizes CBF. We also show 1) an optimal BP that decreases white matter lesion risk, 2) perfusion
correlates with tau pathology, and 3) all these findings occur in older HTN subjects. Despite these new
discoveries, there is a large variance in CBF and cognition due factors other than age and BP, suggesting the
need for further fine-tuning of the model for optimal BP. In this competitive renewal of our NIH/NHLBI R01
HL111724 we propose to focus on variants of the circle of Willis (CoW). They adversely influence CBF and
outcome in chronic and acute conditions. However, very little is known about how they affect perfusion, cognition
and AD markers in HTN. Our data indicate that incomplete variants play a role in circumstances when there is
already a pre-existing impairment of the vascular system (HTN). We offer that these variants in the setting of
HTN necessitate higher perfusion pressure to maintain adequate blood flow, thus increasing the risk for
hypoperfusion and AD-related pathology.
 Over a 2-year we will enroll 140 hypertensive, cognitively healthy subjects, 70-85 years old, with (n=70) and
without (n=70) typical anatomy of the CoW. At baseline and 24-month follow-up, we will perform BP and cognition
assessments, magnetic resonance imaging (including perfusion and vessel anatomy). 50% of the group will
receive both tau (PI-2620) and amyloid (Neuraceq) positron emission tomography at baseline and follow-up. We
will test whether: AIM1. H1. For the same BP, CBF is lower in subjects with an incomplete CoW than in subjects
with a complete circle. H2. Longitudinally, in subjects with an incomplete CoW, for the same baseline BP, an
equal reduction in BP entails greater reduction in CBF than in subjects with a complete circle. AIM2. H1. For the
same BP, baseline amyloid and tau accumulation is higher in subjects with an incomplete CoW than in subjects
with a complete circle. H2. AD biomarkers correlate with CBF. H3. Longitudinally, in subjects with an incomplete
CoW, for the same baseline BP, an equal reduction in BP entails greater accumulation of amyloid and tau than
in subjects who have a complete circle. Secondary AIM. H1. Variants of the posterior circulation (incomplete
posterior circle, vertebral artery hypoplasia) are selectively related to lower hippocampal CBF, and to H2. higher
hippocampal tau accumulation.
We hope our research will contribute to fine-tuning of HTN management and help discover a novel AD risk."

 Gene expression is regulated by the complex molecular cross-talk between DNA methylation (DNAme)
and other chromatin features: e.g. histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) and chromatin associated
proteins (ChAPs; transcription factors and chromatin remodelers). Significantly, changes in the chromatin
landscape can have a profound impact on DNAme patterning (and vice versa), and these changes are connected
to development as well as a broad range of diseases (from cancer to neurological disorders). However, our
understanding of how DNAme co-occurs / coordinates with additional chromatin features to control gene
expression is limited by a lack of reliable genomic tools. Here, EpiCypher is partnering with New England Biolabs
(NEB) to develop Targeted Enzymatic Methylation-sequencing (TEM-seqTM), an ultra-sensitive multiomic
mapping technology that delivers high resolution DNAme profiles (5mC/5hmC) at epitope-defined
chromatin features. EpiCypher is leading the development of ultra-sensitive genomic mapping assays that use
CUT&RUN / CUT&Tag methods (under the CUTANA® platform) to generate truly quantitative data using
dramatically reduced cell input and sequencing depth (>10-fold savings on each parameter vs. ChIP-seq).
CUTANA assays are supported by EpiCypher’s proprietary spike-in designer nucleosome (dNuc) technology to
enable technical monitoring and quantitative normalization. The key innovation of the TEM-seq project is the
development of a novel multiomic workflow that marries EpiCypher’s quantitative CUTANA CUT&RUN
technology with unbiased DNAme analysis using NEB’s enzymatic methyl-seq (EM-seq) approach. EM-seq
utilizes the enzymatic conversion of DNAme (5mC / 5hmC) and provides a much-needed alternative to bisulfite
sequencing (BS; a chemical treatment that degrades DNA and has systemic sequence biases) to generate high
resolution, unbiased DNAme profiles with ~10-fold less sample input (vs. BS). In Phase I Aim 1, we will rigorously
validate our TEM-seq workflow in three cell lines, benchmark results against standard CUT&RUN and EM-seq
assays, and further develop EpiCypher’s spike-in controls for compatibility with TEM-seq. We will advance to
Phase II when we demonstrate that TEM-seq generates highly reliable DNAme maps associated with histone
PTMs and ChAPs using <50k cells and <10M reads. In Phase II Aim 2, we will expand development of spike-in
control panels and develop robust protocols for a wide panel of chromatin features (using validated antibodies)
and sample processing methods (fresh, frozen, and fixed), including drug treatment time-course experiments to
enable clinical applications. In Phase II Aim 3, we will develop / validate a TEM-seq beta kit, and also create a
data analysis portal and automated assays to accelerate commercial adoption and enable a high-throughput
service offering. TEM-seq will provide a powerful new tool to expand our understanding of complex chromatin
signaling, further unlocking the potential of epigenetics-targeted drugs and diagnostics."

The goal of this Direct to Phase II program is to develop and test the efficacy of a Precision Medicine
Clinical Trials Enrollment Platform for kidney diseases. Approximately half of randomized controlled trials do not
meet their recruiting target. Enrolling trials targeting rare kidney diseases is particularly challenging with many
conditions subject to stratification and sub-typing, largely based on histopathological analysis. Due to Arkana’s
position as the largest nephropathology practice in the U.S., drug developers often approach the company to
assist in identifying patients with clinical indications of interest. Focusing recruitment on esoteric nephropathology
is a unique and innovative approach to clinical trials enrollment, which is likely to have significant value to
sponsors. Arkana is therefore in a one-of-a-kind position to support pathology-directed enrollment, with 25+
world-class renal pathologists and access to a large patient population required to form statistically valid cohorts,
even for rare conditions. Arkana has already developed Arkana Connect™, a mobile app allowing clinicians to
track the processing of patient biopsies and retrieve pathology reports. During a Phase I-equivalent program,
the company initiated the development of key infrastructure to support pathology reporting and clinician
communication on the app. Over 1,300 clinicians use the app routinely, providing a straightforward pathway for
market entry of the updated enrollment app capabilities. The company has also benchmarked enrollment
efficiency for multiple rare kidney diseases based on prior clinical trial enrollment projects undertaken with
manual methods; we expect to at least double enrollments through development of technology that improves
patient selection and the communication of trial availability with clinicians. Based on the success of Arkana
Connect™, the company is eager to move forward with development and validation of enrollment functions, as
well as field testing to evaluate: 1) improved enrollment efficiency using the app for rare kidney diseases; and 2)
improve access to clinical trials in traditionally underserved communities including urban, exurban, and rural
areas. During Phase II we will focus on optimizing the digital infrastructure of the app to ensure reliable
communication and compliance with regulations regarding patient privacy. Discrete element search functions
will be developed, allowing clinical trial sponsors to target narrowly defined patient populations, essential for
development of therapeutics against rare diseases. Validation studies will be undertaken to finalize the
commercial version of the app and a subsequent study representing 400 participating physicians will be
performed to evaluate the ability of this new technology and process to improve clinical trial enrollment. Data
from these evaluations will provide compelling evidence to Arkana’s customers, the sponsors of kidney disease
clinical trials, that pathology-directed patient recruitment aided by technology can address the unmet need for
efficient and targeted clinical trial enrollment."

 3 Digital Health Interventions (DHIs) have the capability to reach and positively impact far more people across a
 4 large geographical area compared to health interventions that require in-person attendance and use. Compared
 5 to in-person health interventions, DHIs require fewer resources to operate (e.g., fewer staff, less space) and may
 6 also help lessen participants / clients’ burden by requiring fewer resources of them, such as saving costs and
 7 time by foregoing travel and enabling greater flexibility for when they would use the DHIs (e.g., lunch break, on
 8 their own time). DHIs additionally offer other capabilities to fine-tune and tailor content, activities, and messaging
 9 to the individual, couple, as well as group levels – further increasing their relevance, personalization, and
10 customization. Despite these advantages, the resources required to develop DHIs are extensive and often
11 require several years, multiple grants, and significant costs just to build 1 webapp or native app. Moreover, there
12 are currently no viable solutions for the long-term sustainability and maintenance of DHIs, which is essential to
13 reach their utmost potential for wide-scale dissemination and implementation. The proposed 1-year SBIR Phase
14 1 project will provide a solution to these challenges by developing a functional prototype of the HERO
15 (Health/care Environment for Research and Organization programs) platform. The prototype of the HERO
16 platform will be secure, HIPAA compliant, intuitive to use software that is state-of-the-art by including a suite of
17 menu options with both a user and admin portal interfaces to create and/or host DHIs over time. The HERO
18 platform will be have 2 respective pathways that reflect the primary purpose for using the software: (1) to develop
19 and evaluate DHIs via research studies, and (2) to host and link already developed (and efficacious) DHI
20 programs with healthcare settings that have an existing website. To bring the proposed solution to reality, we
21 have a compiled a talented research and web development team with an established history of collaboration
22 centered on DHIs (9+ years). To inform and develop the HERO platform prototype, the MPIs will lead a talented
23 team of software and UI/UX engineers along with a diverse Topical Expert Panel, paired with obtaining input
24 from 600 key stakeholders (DHI researchers, healthcare leaders) across different health domains. The proposed
25 project will leverage best practices of Human-Centered Design, and solicit and integrate feedback from 600 key
26 stakeholders and an experienced Topical Expert Panel to identify key features and functions to include in the
27 software (Aim 1), and apply mock- and test-case scenarios to create a functional software prototype of the HERO
28 platform (Aim 2). The scientific premise, rigor, and innovation of the HERO platform aligns with the need to
29 help ensure the sustainability of DHIs by addressing challenges of dissemination and implementation, while also
30 minimizing the required resources to develop tailored DHIs for a variety of populations and health/care outcomes."

The organ transplantation process faces significant challenges, resulting in poor patient
outcomes, wasted resources, and a growing demand that outpaces the supply. With nearly
120,000 patients on the waitlist and 17 patients dying daily awaiting a donor organ, current
organ matching methods are suboptimal and inadequate. Despite the wealth of data available,
no comprehensive clinical tools exist to aid transplant centers and Organ Procurement
Organizations (OPOs) in making critical, time-sensitive organ allocation decisions.
InformAI is developing TransplantAI, an innovative clinical decision support platform that utilizes
granular, data-driven insights to assist clinicians in making informed decisions regarding organ
use and allocation. This NIH SBIR Fast-Track Phase I/II proposal leverages over 500 relevant
data points, including donor-recipient organ size-matching information, to significantly improve
organ allocation and utilization, ultimately saving lives and lowering healthcare costs.
Phase I builds upon our previous research (2021-2023) in liver and kidney transplantation,
expanding our focus to heart and lung transplantation. As of December 2022, 3,300 patients
were awaiting a heart transplant and 1,000 patients were awaiting a lung transplant. We will
assess the accuracy of machine learning (ML) methods, such as XGBoost, in predicting pre-
and post-transplant outcomes for heart and lung transplant patients, and develop deep learning
U-Net models for accurate organ segmentation from CT scans.
Phase II integrates our previous research and AI models in kidney and liver transplantation with
our Phase I results and AI models in heart and lung transplantation into a human-in-the-loop AI
system for predicting transplant patient outcomes across all organ types (heart, lung, liver, and
kidney). TransplantAI overcomes the constraints of current methods by using advanced
machine learning techniques for more precise risk assessments with explainable factors
impacting predictions and offers a comprehensive method for accurate organ size matching and
improved post-transplant outcomes.
Our SBIR project aims to deliver quantitative and validated outcome predictions at the point of
care for transplant physicians and clinical care teams to improve solid organ transplantation
outcomes. This project addresses critical challenges in organ allocation efficiency and patient
outcomes, paving the way for future advancements in solid organ transplantation."

Alara Imaging, Inc. (Alara) is seeking funding to support the development of robust, IP-protected, HIPAA-
compliant commercial quality software to calculate and report on quality measures that will be reported for
every radiologist and hospital group in the nation. Further, Alara is seeking funding to develop enhanced
feedback that leverages machine learning, data visualization, and benchmarking to guide physicians and
hospitals on safe approaches for lowering their CT radiation doses. Once implemented at scale through the
support of this award, Alara’s software has the potential to reduce the cancers that result from CT by up to
30%, preventing as many as 10,000 cancers annually.
The use of CT has grown substantially over the last 2 decades with 90 million CT exams performed annually in
the U.S. A major quality gap exists in the performance of CT as the radiation doses used for these exams are
higher than needed for diagnosis and in the range where they increase a person's risk of developing cancer; it
is estimated that CT use causes 36,000 cancers annually in the U.S.1 The inconsistency in how CT exams are
performed represents a modifiable health risk as radiation doses can be reduced through audit and feedback,
as shown in a UCSF led, NCI funded, trial.2
In 2019, UCSF was awarded a cooperative agreement from CMS to develop CT radiation dose and image
quality measures for use in the agency’s pay-for-performance programs. The intent of this award was to
motivate radiologists and hospitals and to reduce unnecessarily high radiation doses through financial
incentives. UCSF created the approach to judge each CT by combining clinical and radiology data located in
disparate health data systems including the Electronic Health Record, Radiology Information System, and
Picture Archiving and Communication System. These data systems communicate poorly, and properly
ingesting and normalizing these data in real time was a technological challenge. Additionally, as a stipulation of
the funding, CMS required UCSF to develop these measures as electronic clinical quality measures (eCQM);
however, the resources required to develop and implement an eCQM at the national level were beyond what
was available to Dr. Smith-Bindman from CMS. As a result, Dr. Smith-Bindman, in collaboration with UCSF as
a minority equity stakeholder, worked with radiology informatics experts to create a commercial entity, Alara, to
develop the eCQMs and software for national implementation. The measures are now being considered for
use in CMS quality payment programs, and Alara is now seeking funding to implement the measures at scale.
In addition to the CMS measure functionality, the software’s architecture will represent a meaningful
technological advancement and creates value beyond measure reporting by linking and providing access to
combined clinical and radiology data connected to the cloud. Information technology companies that are
driving care forward in radiology using novel machine learning and computer vision techniques need access to
the same linked data so that they can leverage modern technology applications. Alara’s software, “The
Gateway”, solves this integration and data access challenge, and Alara will sell access to the Gateway to
technology companies, opening possibilities for technology companies to develop additional solutions that take
advantage of the linked and structured data."

significantly enhance the scope by supporting transducers for common tests of auditory function, including
audiometry, otoacoustic emissions (OAEs), wideband acoustic immittance (WAI), speech recognition, and
eventually evoked potentials; (ii) it will add software designed to easily administer a test battery and share test
paradigms and data across research studies; and (iii) it will provide interfaces to back-end servers for seamless

The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has caused severe economical and humanitarian loss worldwide after it
first emergence in Wuhan, China in 2019. The genetic material of this virus is comprised of enveloped, positive-
sense, single-stranded RNA. SARS-CoV-2 genome is evolutionary related to the beta coronavirus SARS-CoV
causing the previous outbreak in 2003. Currently several vaccines have been launched but targeted therapy to
control viral replication and propagation remains limited. In order to rapidly innovate effective medications for
clinical curing of this viral infection, we propose to develop new therapeutic agents against COVID-19. We aim
to target the nonstructural protein 16 (Nsp16) of SARS-CoV-2, the ribose 2′-O-methyltransferase enzyme (2′-O-
MTase) that is responsible for the formation of viral RNA cap-1 structure. The Nsp16 MTase requires the Nsp10
adaptor protein as a co-factor for its enzyme function. The methylation of viral RNA by the Nsp16/Nsp10 complex
is critical for both viral replication and viral evasion by host immune recognition. Thus, inhibitors targeting the
viral RNA 5’-capping pathways are ideal for controlling and eliminating the virulence of SARS-CoV-2. In this
project, we will perform fluorescence polarization (FP)-based high throughput screening (HTS) of small molecule
compound libraries using innovative fluorescent analogs of SAM, the methyl donor. We will follow up with several
functional MTase assays including HTRF and 32P-labeled substrates to confirm the identified inhibitory activity
of selected novel drug-like molecules against the Nsp16/Nsp10 MTase complex of SARS-CoV-2. Validated
Nsp16/Nsp10 2’-O-MTase inhibitors will be tested for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Medicinal
optimization of promising candidates will be carried out. Finally, we will use in vivo animal models to investigate
the antiviral efficacy of the most potent candidate. The accomplishment of this drug discovery project is to
generate a novel avenue of experimental therapy against the existential COVID-19 pandemic via inhibiting the
5’-capping pathways of the coronavirus."

epithelium (OE) to renew and regenerate the population of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) depends on the
life-long persistence and proper function of stem cells. The pathological changes underlying presbyosmia are
due to the disordering and eventual depletion of the normally active olfactory stem and progenitor cells, namely
globose basal cells (GBCs), and the disappearance of the OSNs. In this setting of neurogenic exhaustion, the
reserve stem cells, namely the horizontal basal cells (HBCs), remain dormant despite the neurogenic
exhaustion and disappearance of GBCs. In contrast, if the OE is damaged by an olfactotoxin, the HBCs
activate and contribute to the repair of the epithelium. The key to the activation of HBCs and their rejuvenation
of the olfactory epithelium is the transcription factor Np63, which is the master switch that controls the cycle
of dormancy-activation, such that it is necessary and sufficient to suppress levels of p63 to shift the HBCs out
of dormancy and into active mode. This STTR application from Rhino Therapeutics, Inc. and Tufts University
School of Medicine seeks to advance the therapeutic strategy of using a p63-targeting siRNA drug to
synthetically activate the HBCs and drive their participation in OE repair. Substantial preliminary data suggest
this is a viable approach. The three Specific Aims of the project will 1) establish the sequence, dose, and
duration of exposure for the optimal siRNA on cultured human and mouse HBCs, and rule out off-target
effects; 2) demonstrate the efficacy of the preferred siRNA agent and regimen for activation of the HBCs in
vivo in a mouse model of neurogenic exhaustion; 3) engender a preclinical demonstration of compound
efficacy by xenotransplanting in vitro siRNA-activated human HBCs into the OE of immunocompromised rats,
demomstrating engraftment of the HBCs, and monitoring their differentiation into the constituent cells of the
host OE. Completion of the Aims will constitute an important and substantive step towards assembly of a
compelling data package on the way to IND-designation and phased clinical trials of a first-in-field drug for
treating presbyosmia and potentially other forms of smell dysfunction."
10820745,"Project Summary/Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has led to significant advances in the study of brain structure and
function. In studies of auditory perception and speech-related functions, the earphones used to deliver
stimuli in an MR scanner must not contain ferrous or magnetic metals due to the scanner's immense
magnetic field strength. In addition, the strong magnetic gradients and radio frequency energy used during a
scan can induce electric currents even in non-ferrous metal components, which must be carefully designed
to prevent excessive heating. Finally, any metallic structures can interfere with the imaging process, leading
to artifacts in the image. New imaging protocols to improve spatial resolution and temporal sensitivity can
increase energy deposition and heating in materials with magnetic susceptibility that were unaffected under
older imaging protocols. While most of the world's MR scanners use magnetic field strengths of 3 Tesla (T)
or less, the demand for higher imaging resolution drives demand for scanners with greater field strength,
making them a fast-growing sector of the scanner market. Increasingly, research centers are installing
human MR systems capable of static field strengths of 7T or higher, with about 100 such scanners installed
worldwide; a handful of 9T scanners are already in operation, and a massive 11.7T human system is online
at the Neurospin facility in France. For animal research, small-bore scanners with ultra-high fields are in
use. The growing presence of ultra-high field systems will require earphones that can provide research-
grade auditory stimuli without compromising safety or introducing image distortions. There is no
commercially available audio driver that is free of metallic components. Even our company's current
earbuds—mostly used in 1.5T and 3T scanners—include some (non-ferrous) metallic components as
mechanical sound amplifiers and electrical conductors. Successive generations of earbud models have
progressively reduced metallic components to minimize imaging artifacts and heating, but this iterative
material reduction is no longer sufficient. Instead, a fundamentally new approach is required—we propose
to build earbuds entirely free of metallic components. For this, we will develop a novel audio driver that
does not require metal parts to deliver research-quality audio stimuli. The design will then be tested in 7T
and 11.7T scanners."

The maternal morbidity and mortality associated with gestational hypertension, and specifically pre-eclampsia,
remains a serious issue within the United States, affecting up to 8% of pregnancies. In addition, there are also
disparities and biases in the healthcare system that leads to a disproportionate incidence of pre-eclampsia for
mothers based on racial and socioeconomic factors. The lack of objective and affordable technologies for
predicting and diagnosing gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia plays at least some part in this continued
health crisis. The current standard of care for predicting and diagnosing pre-eclampsia relies on biometrics which
are prone to bias and lack clinical accuracy. In recent years, new biomarkers, such as Placental Growth Factor
(PlGF), have been identified and proven to have strong diagnostic potential for predicting and detecting pre-
eclampsia. However, there is not yet an accurate, sensitive, quantitative, and affordable tool for measuring PlGF
at the point-of-care (POC). Ricovr Healthcare has invented a novel diagnostic platform for performing an
immunoassay using a plasmonic fiber-optic absorbance biosensor (P-FAB). This technology is capable of
quantitatively measuring a wide range of biomarkers at ultrasensitive concentrations ranging from 1 fg/mL to 1
ug/mL in as little as ten minutes with a wash-free immunoassay. The platform is low-cost, handheld, and simple
to use; it is comprised of a reusable connected reader device and disposable cartridges, enabling POC
applications for pre-eclampsia diagnosis such as during routine prenatal visits in primary care or
obstetrician/gynecologist offices. This Phase I SBIR proposal aims to demonstrate the feasibility of developing
a POC assay for measuring PlGF on the P-FAB platform at clinically relevant concentrations and to validate its
performance using authentic biologic samples. The successful completion of these objectives will lead to
subsequent analytical and clinical trials to support a 510(k) submission to the FDA as part of a Phase II SBIR
proposal. The culmination of these studies will be the development of an objective and affordable POC tool for
detecting, predicting, and monitoring pre-eclampsia in clinical settings."
10821268,"Belonging is an integral part of the human experience and a paramount human need and motivation. A robust
sense of belonging can serve to improve mental and physical health, as well as resilience. Thwarted belonging—
the antithesis of belonging—and the feelings/experiences it foments (e.g., alienation, rejection, social isolation,
loneliness, and marginality) are often antecedents to poor mental and physical health outcomes. Individuals
who possess marginalized identities—such as members of the LGBTQ+ community who possess marginalized
sexual and gender identities—encounter high rates of discrimination and stigma, which account for experiences
of thwarted belonging and disparities in health and well-being. In an increasingly polarized world, workplaces
serve as important sources of belonging for their employees; however, members of the LGBTQ+ community
continue to experience thwarted belonging as many organizations lack the policies and procedures necessary to
make LGBTQ+ workers feel safe, connected, and included. As a result of organizational cultures often being
founded on heteronormative and cisnormative assumptions, LGBTQ+ individuals are forced to confront
dominant workplace cultures that are unwelcoming. The transformation of the workplace, as precipitated by
the COVID-19 pandemic, further hinders LGBTQ+ workers’ pursuit of belonging in the workplace in that it has
led to an increase in burnout and, often, a reduction in the possibilities for work-based social connections.
While interventions to promote workplace belonging among LGBTQ+ workers would address an important
unmet public health need, existing solutions consist of a number of gaps that limit effectiveness and
applicability to LGBTQ+ workers. The proposed research will employ a participatory design approach to create
and examine the acceptability and preliminary effects of Bridges: an advanced Learning Management System
and messaging program that will leverage insights from behavior change science to address thwarted
belongingness among LGBTQ+ workers. Bridges will use proven approaches to behavior change tailoring to
increase belongingness through delivering interactive behavior change communications and activities,
providing a platform to facilitate sharing of personalized stories and opportunities to engage in ongoing
discussions and self-appraisal, and providing actionable tips for addressing belonging within the workplace.
The design and development of Bridges will be informed by extensive and ongoing end-user input from 12
LGBTQ+ worker advisors. One hundred and twenty-nine LGBTQ+ workers will be recruited for a 30-day pilot
test. Phase I milestones will include: 1) feasibility as evidenced by continued receipt of text messages for the
30-day pilot period and one or more interactions with the online tools by at least 75% of study participants; 2)
acceptability of the program, as evidenced by obtaining a minimum rating over 69 on the System Usability
Scale and 75% endorsement that users would recommend to a colleague; and 3) preliminary efficacy as
evidenced by improved professional fulfillment."
10821563,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nine out of ten drug candidates that are shown to be safe and effective in animal testing ultimately fail in
human trials. A great deal of work over the last decade has focused on leveraging pluripotent stem cells to
create human organoids and microphysiological organ-on-chip models which present a lower cost, ethical,
scalable, and more physiologically-relevant alternative to animal testing. These organoids are 3D tissues
representing the full range of cell phenotypes present in various human organ systems. With the recent
passage of the FDA Modernization Act 2.0, congress has allowed FDA to accept organoids as alternatives
to animal testing for drug approvals. Organoid model development has also been broadly prioritized across
the NIH. As organoids move toward translational practice, there is a large and growing unmet need
for new bioreactor tools designed specifically for organoid culture. Mosaic is leveraging fifteen years
of microfluidics research and high-volume manufacturing experience to create a versatile, programmable,
easy-to-use, and scalable perfusion bioreactor platform for microphysiological systems. We are
partnering with early adopters in the emerging organoid and cell therapy industries as well as manufacturing
partners with expertise in injection molding microfluidic consumables. Our platform overcomes several major
bottlenecks in the development and scalable application of organ-on-chip assays for drug discovery. Our
microfluidic consumable follows a standard SBS plate form factor, allowing it to be integrated into
broader laboratory automation workflows. Our low-cost electronic pressure manifold leverages recent
advances in MEMS technology to precisely drive fluids and actuate on-chip valves across a standardized
microfluidic consumable interface. In this Phase I, we will validate this platform by demonstrating iPSC
cardiovascular organoid differentiation and observation under perfusion culture. We will show that a single
bioreactor yields hundreds of healthy, phenotypically-consistent vascularized cardiac organoids,
and that these organoids can be differentially dosed with pharmacological agents under
physiologically-relevant perfusion conditions. We will develop an intuitive scripting interface for
automating cell culture and screening protocols. Our first product (Phase II) is an R&D hardware and software
platform for microfluidic bioreactor automation compatible with standard live cell imaging microscopes. Our
long-term goal is to develop a fully-integrated system with imaging and microfluidic automation,
along with a catalog of standard microfluidic consumables for a variety of use cases including
hepatocyte culture for toxicity screening, tumor spheroid perfusion, suspension culture for immunotherapy
production, and general cell biology."
10824383,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dance movement is a form of physical activity that may benefit the brain as much or more than structured
aerobic exercise. Despite the potential of dance as an intervention to promote neurocognitive health, gaps in
knowledge about essential intervention components are a barrier to definitive trials, specifically:1) a lack of
specificity on key prescription parameters including how many times a week dance classes should be taught,
2) need for better estimates of how large an effect dance has on fitness and the brain, and 3) little
understanding of the expected time course for change in fitness and the brain in response to dance. The
primary aim of this proposal is to test whether weekly dance frequency differentially modifies key outcomes,
and from this to test effect sizes to determine sufficient sample sizes for a larger-scale trial. Physical activity
promoting interventions tested in older adults have traditionally focused on exercise, i.e., structured physical
activity of at least moderate intensity with the express purpose of improving health or fitness. However, in
2003, epidemiological evidence showed that social dance was the only leisure time physical activity associated
with lower Alzheimer’s disease risk. Since then, multiple smaller studies have shown benefits of dance
movement and dance therapy on mobility and neurocognitive health in older adults, including cardiorespiratory
fitness, balance, white matter health, and cognition. Dance movement inherently involves simultaneous
cognitive stimulation through motor learning and dual-tasking; social interactions; aerobic physical activity that
elevates heart rate and improves cardiorespiratory fitness; and improves balance and reduces fall risk. Dance
also satisfies key antecedents of lasting behavior change outlined in contemporary behavioral theories
including self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, autonomy, and relatedness. Dance is also culturally relevant and
has been practiced spontaneously for thousands of years. This means dance may result in better long-term
adherence than more commonly studied forms of aerobic exercise like brisk walking, where data from our
group and others shows that adherence drops significantly after intervention ends. This proposal plans to
assess outcomes of 1x/weekly, 2x/weekly, and 3x/weekly dance movement classes and 1x/week music
appreciation class control at 4 time-points over 6 months to determine the time course of changes in
cardiorespiratory fitness, cognition, and key secondary outcomes in 160 adults ≥ 65 years old at risk for
Alzheimer’s disease due to subjective cognitive decline. 1x/weekly is common for community classes and has
been tested in multiple dance studies; 2x/weekly is most common in dance research; and 3x/weekly is most
common for aerobic exercise interventions like treadmill walking that target CRF. We aim to determine the
optimal frequency of dance movement intervention for a Phase III trial that will effect change in relevant
outcomes while maintaining attendance."
10824266,"The neuronal circuitry within the dentate gyrus is massively disrupted in temporal lobe epilepsy patients and in
experimental models of this disorder. This proposal builds upon our laboratory’s previous findings, which
demonstrate that the dentate gyrus circuitry within the epileptic hippocampus retains an embedded coding
network of dentate granule cells which can reemerge and restore appropriate cognitive function following
treatments to suppress degraded pathologic activity. The maintained competence of this embedded dentate
granule cell network occurs despite the significant structural pathology which is unaffected by therapeutic
interventions. In this proposal, we will build upon this foundation, and examine and manipulate dentate granule
cells in both epileptic and control animals to generate a mechanistic understanding of how these epilepsy-
associated disruptions to normal circuit functioning can be targeted to restore downstream, emergent
properties of the hippocampus, such as learning and memory and emotional behaviors. The CENTRAL
HYPOTHESIS of the present proposal is that the epilepsy-associated degradation in coding properties of
dentate granule cells contributes significantly to both the cognitive and behavioral comorbidities that constitute
key components of the core phenotypes of temporal lobe epilepsy. To test this Central Hypothesis, we propose
to conduct a series of experiments centered on 3 SPECIFIC AIMS: Aim 1. Characterize the local circuit
properties defining the active dentate granule cell network in epileptic and control mice. Aim 2. Determine the
capacity, time course, and extent of long-term dentate gyrus circuit specific intervention strategies to rescue
cognitive and behavioral function in epileptic mice. Aim 3. Assess the contribution of dentate granule cell
hyperexcitability in epileptic mice to disrupted hippocampal spatial coding. We know little about the
mechanisms that mediate the sparse yet deterministic firing properties of neuronal populations in the
hippocampal dentate gyrus that are responsible for their role in information coding and plasticity. We know
even less about how disease-associated degradation in these critical dentate granule cell properties develop,
and in turn how this excitability disruption may erode cognitive and affective functions that the hippocampus
normally supports. In addition to the enhanced excitability responsible for seizure generation, patients with
epilepsy exhibit severe cognitive comorbidities, including deficits in emotion, mood, and learning and memory,
processes typically thought of as limbic system functions. Understanding how epilepsy development alters the
basic circuit properties within the limbic system may be important not only in targeting new therapies for
seizure amelioration, but also in developing new treatments to reduce comorbid conditions accompanying
epilepsy development, a largely unexplored area of therapy development."

Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are respiratory viruses that represent a continual threat to the health of many
Americans, and will likely account for 100,000 deaths and many times that number of hospitalizations in the US
alone each year. The available vaccines are inadequate, with the recent flu vaccine estimated to be only 40%
effective and while the RNA vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have been remarkable at preventing severe illness or death,
they do not prevent reinfection in many people. Many with pre-existing conditions or immune deficiencies (e.g.,
obesity, diabetes) are vulnerable, which leads to suppressed response to vaccine or increased risk of severe
outcome upon infection. Thus, the need to understand and improve both vaccines and the response to them is
urgent. The Stanford CCHI has been a leader in understanding influenza vaccination and infection, and very quickly
developed complementary expertise during the pandemic, making great strides in both understanding SARS-CoV-
2 infection and vaccine responses, and also in developing new technologies that promise even greater advances.
These range from Dr. Wang’s insights in the effects of antibody glycosylation and lung inflammation, to Dr. Barnes
seminal work on the structures of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Work that Dr. Barnes will carry further by
designing and testing novel flu and SARS-Cov-2 antigen constructs. Dr. Khatri has also developed bioinformatic
methods that have revealed conserved gene signatures regarding the immune response to viruses, and which he
will use to define the cells and mechanisms that underlie these signatures. The clinical core under Dr. Chinthrajah
will recruit and vaccinate obese and diabetic patients at risk for severe COVID and Influenza illness, and the results
will be analyzed by Dr. Wang and also by the Human Immune Monitoring core under Dr. Maecker. Dr. Davis will
head the Technology Development project which will continue his development of immune organoids and the use
of spleen organoids particularly to characterize both existing and novel vaccine responses, and also attempt to
reconstruct immune responses to vaccination and infection using skin and lung organoids from the same donors.
Organoid responses to vaccination or infection will be validated against data in human subjects using our collection
of influenza and SARS-CoV-2 specific T and B cell probes, as well as through TCR and BCR sequence analysis.
Organoid processing and banking will be handled by the clinical core and all projects will make use of this resource,
which will be especially useful in testing particular immunogens for their ability to make the desired antibodies, or
the use of gene editing to identify key loci mediating particular effects. Immune organoids and the networks we
propose to create will give us the ability to test hypotheses and define mechanisms in an entirely human system.
The overall theme of this submission is to continue our efforts to understand Influenza and SARS-CoV-2
vaccination and infection using a broad range of approaches, integrating molecular, structural and bioinformatic
methods, in vivo with unique cohorts and in vitro with organoids."
10824270,"The cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1 alpha (PKG1α) opposes pathological left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy
and remodeling via roles in the cardiac myocyte (CM) and regulates blood pressure by promoting vascular
smooth muscle cell (VSMC) relaxation and vasodilation. Drugs which activate PKG1, including nitrates,
sacubitril/valsartan, vericiguat, and others have improved mortality in heart failure with reduced LV ejection
fraction (HFrEF) and thus represent a central advance in HFrEF treatment. However, these therapies remain
limited by incomplete efficacy in HFrEF. Furthermore, hypotension from PKG1-induced vasodilation has severely
limited the practical use of these agents. The overarching hypothesis of this program is that identifying
downstream PKG1α anti-remodeling substrates in the LV can reveal novel therapeutic candidates to overcome
these critical limitations of current PKG1-activating drugs. We have identified Mixed Lineage Kinase 3 (MLK3)
as a novel PKG1α-interacting protein and anti-remodeling molecule. We propose to explore the following exciting
findings which identify MLK3 as a translationally relevant molecule in HFrEF. 1) PKG1α-MLK3 interaction
declines in the failing LV, and MLK3 is required for PKG1α-mediated therapeutic effects of sildenafil on LV
function after pressure overload, thus identifying disruption of myocardial MLK3 regulation by PKG as promoting
LV remodeling and decreasing the efficacy of PKG1-activating drugs in HF. 2) MLK3 kinase function opposes
pathological CM and LV dysfunction and remodeling but does not affect blood pressure in vivo. 3) MLK3 deletion
promotes hypertension in vivo, but MLK3 regulation of blood pressure occurs through MLK3 kinase independent
mechanisms and independently of signaling by PKG1α. We propose to test a two-part novel model in which 1)
PKG1α activation of MLK3 promotes LV compensation to pressure overload through MLK3 kinase-dependent
mechanisms in the CM; and 2) MLK3 opposes hypertension through kinase-independent effects on vascular
stiffness through a role in the VSMC. SA1 will use novel MLK3 cell-specific deletion models developed in our lab
to determine the CM and SMC-specific roles of MLK3 in basal regulation of LV function and blood pressure and
in the chronic LV response to pressure overload or myocardial infarction. SA2 will determine the kinase
dependent versus kinase independent effects of MLK3 on LV function and blood pressure. SA3 will determine
the translational relevance of MLK3 to HF treatment by testing the requirement of MLK3 for LV therapeutic effects
versus blood pressure effects of currently available PKG1-activating drugs. These studies will define novel
mechanisms through which MLK3 regulates blood pressure and through which MLK3 blood pressure-
independent functions mediate the therapeutic effect of current PKG1-activating drugs. These studies have the
potential to identify MLK3 kinase activation as a novel therapeutic strategy to promote PKG1 therapeutic effects
on LV function and remodeling but avoid undesired hypotension which has limited PKG1 activating drugs."
10824421,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer immunotherapy has made great strides in recent years, yet improved approaches are required to
achieve more durable responses in a greater number of patients. Blockade of the inhibitory receptor
programmed-death 1 (PD-1) enables tumor-reactive T cells to effectively recognize and eliminate tumors in a
subset of responsive patients, but many patients are resistant to PD-1 blockade. To improve response rates, we
need to better understand the mechanisms that lead to therapeutic resistance. The overall goal of this project
is to understand the role of T cell–intrinsic factors that contribute to patient response versus resistance to
PD-1 blockade. We will identify signaling pathways and gene-expression patterns associated with blockade
response with a particular focus on the role of T-cell receptor (TCR) affinity. We hypothesize that the make-up
of TCR affinities of tumor-specific T cells affects tumor antigen recognition, activation signaling, and
downstream gene expression, thus contributing to patient response to therapy. Analysis of these parameters
in patient samples and mouse models of PD-1 blockade will allow us to identify T cell properties characteristic
of response to therapy. In our first aim we will isolate and quantify the TCR-binding properties of melanoma
antigen-specific T cells from PD-1 blockade–responsive and –resistant patients to determine how TCR affinity
profiles influence PD-1 blockade responses. In our second aim we will use proteomic and genomic analysis of
patient antigen-specific T cells to develop a global signature of PD-1 blockade response and resistance. In our
third aim we will use a panel of melanoma patient–derived TCRs with varying affinities for the same antigen
for in vitro and in vivo experiments to determine how TCR affinity influences response to PD-1 blockade.
Overall, we will determine the contribution of TCR affinities of melanoma-specific T cells to blockade
resistance and will provide evidence to support the targeting of specific T cells based on TCR affinity for
combination therapies and the selection of patients likely to respond to PD-1 blockade therapy based on TCR
affinity profiles."
10824422,"The broad objective of this study is to identify the neural substrate(s) underlying the homeostatic sleep
response (HSR), i.e. enhanced sleepiness following prolonged sleep deprivation (SD). SD is experienced by
many due to lifestyle or vocational demands and is accompanied by impaired cognition, increased impulsivity,
and an increased likelihood of accidents. Furthermore, disrupted sleep is a common feature of many
neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying the HSR is critical to develop
measures to combat the deleterious consequences of SD. Specifically, here we will address the central
question: “Are all neural wake-promoting systems equally important in triggering the HSR?” Our overarching
hypothesis is that basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic neurons (ChAT+) are modulated by glutamate and play a
privileged role in the HSR by causing the release of extracellular adenosine (ADex), which increases sleep by
inhibiting wake-promoting BF neurons, and thereby adjusts the state of the system towards its' set point.
Towards this goal, Aim 1, will test if BF cholinergic neurons, but not the brainstem pedunculopontine tegmental
(PPT) cholinergic neurons, are required for HSR. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that within BF, only those non-
cholinergic wake-promoting neurons projecting to, and exciting, BF ChAT+ neurons will induce HSR. Aim 3
will test if stimulation of wake-promoting BF-vGluT2+ and PPT-vGluT2+ neurons will only induce HSR if BF
ChAT+ neurons are intact, i.e. the integrity of BF ChAT+ neurons is necessary to trigger the HSR. Finally, Aim
4 will test the dual role of BF ChAT+ neurons in promoting arousal and sleep homeostasis. We will use our
novel mouse `optodialysis' probes (Zant et al., 2016) that combine optical manipulation of selective neuronal
populations with in vivo microdialysis for detecting local neurochemical changes and/or application of
pharmacological agents. The successful completions of these investigations will further our understanding of
the neural substrates necessary for inducing the HSR, and thus will help in developing targeted
pharmacological interventions against the deleterious effects of sleep loss."

cells
PROJECT SUMMARY
The MYBL1 gene belongs to the MYB family of genes, which includes c-MYB and MYBL2. The genes
are proto-oncogenes that function as strong transcriptional activators involved in proliferation,
differentiation and cell cycle signaling processes, all which are key events in tumor progression. Studies
showed that truncated c-MYB is an oncogene and as such, the gene was studied as a therapeutic target for
breast cancers. Less is known about MYBL1 and MYBL2. Both play substantial roles in cell cycle
progression and are overexpressed in different cancers, including breast cancers. Published results from
the Player laboratory showed MYBL1 overexpressed in a subpopulation of triple negative breast cancers
(TNBC). In a separate comprehensive supervised network analyses of luminal breast cancers, MYBL1
overexpression was shown to correlate with poor disease prognosis. Based on these studies the principal
investigator‘s (PI) laboratory chose to study the MYBL1 gene with an interest in characterizing the gene
in non-tumor TN compared to TNBC and identifying genes affected by its expression in the cancers. The
experimental approach is to knockdown the MYBL1 gene in the samples, perform microarray analyses to
identify genes differentially affected by the processes, followed by further analyses to authenticate
candidate genes identified during the process. As a proof of concept, MYBL1 gene was down-regulated
in a TNBC cell line. The candidate genes affected by decreasing MYBL1 expression include MYBL2 and
an enrichment in cell cycle signaling genes some of which are novel. This observation is consistent with
those which show co-expression of MYBL1 and MYBL2 and substantiate the ability of MYBL1 to
regulate expression of MYBL2. The experiments outlined in the current study should broaden our
understanding of signaling events in triple negative breast samples. For Aim 1, the investigators will
continue knockdown studies of MYBL1 in TNBC and include an additional TNBC and a non-tumor TN
sample as comparisons. These data will allow the PI to identify differential patterns of regulation by
MYBL1 in non-tumor compared to triple negative cancers in efforts to identify genes and processes that
might be associated with tumor progression. Because TNBC are heterogeneous, this study is confined to
subtype B, MYBL1 expressing samples. Reliable signature genes will be identified, and pathway analyses
performed. The hypothesis is that expression of MYBL1 in the different tissues result in different
signaling mechanisms. Select differentially expressed genes will be examined using tissue microarrays
with defined receptor status and survival data and compared to the MYBL1 gene expression pattern. For
Aim 2, the proliferative capacity and invasive potential of the various knockdown samples will be
compared. For Aim 3 the tumorigenic properties of control untreated, shRNA scrambled control and
MYBL1 shRNA knockdown preparations for each cell line will be examined via Soft Agar analyses."

PROJECT TITLE: Studies of P-glycoprotein drug interactions
P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is a molecular pump that detoxifies cells by transporting hundreds of structurally
unrelated toxins out of the cell. Pgp limits uptake in the intestines, and enhances excretion of drugs in
the liver, kidney and blood-brain barrier, of many drugs that are used for treatment of cancers, HIV/AIDS,
psychiatric illnesses, and cardiovascular conditions. It is among the seven most important transporters
responsible for regulating drug absorption and disposition that now require documentation of drug
interactions for approval of any new drugs by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Pgp is an
ATP-binding cassette transporter with two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide-binding
domains (NBDs). It uses ATP hydrolysis to pump substrates across the cell membranes. Our recent X-
ray structures of Pgp identified hydrophobic and aromatic amino acids that contribute to binding of
different inhibitors to the drug-binding site. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that therapeutic
drugs bind to different subsets of residues within defined subpockets in the TMDs of the protein. Our
general approach is to introduce tryptophans (Trps) at strategic positions in order to monitor drug
binding. The Trps will be introduced on the background of a new fully functional Trp-less Pgp, or a low-
Trp Pgp that retains three native conformationally sensitive Trps in the cytoplasmic domains. Using
fluorescence changes, such as quenching, and resonance energy transfer (FRET), we will map out
sites of interaction of the purified protein with prototypical substrates that occupy biochemically defined
and distinct binding sites, as well as those of common therapeutic drugs and newly identified inhibitors.
We will further insert a fluorescent Trp analog (L-Anap) into wild-type Pgp using the amber stop codon
suppression strategy to explore monitoring drug binding in biological cell membranes. By determining
how drugs and inhibitors modulate the cooperativity and conformational dynamics of this multidomain
transporter, we will gain unique insight into the mechanisms of drug binding and their effects on Pgp
function. With these new approaches, we will address the molecular mechanism and kinetics of
drug/inhibitor binding, determine synergistic effects, and refine the mechanisms of drug-drug
interactions in Pgp. The information will pave the way to new analytical approaches to refine Pgp drug
interaction studies of old and new drugs, and will be invaluable to redesign drugs with clinically
favorable pharmacokinetics and accelerate pharmacotherapeutic developments."
10825318,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this technology development project, we want to continue the significant progress that we made in this last
granting period and take advantage of the many opportunities that we see to make human immune organoids
an indispensable system for understanding human immune responses to vaccination and infection. Fortunately,
we have made several major advances in our organoid work recently, especially our focus on spleen organoids
that we obtain through our collaboration with Donor Network West, which now regularly supplies us with both
spleens, skin, blood and lung fragments from a given donor. We have found that spleens are much more diverse
in cell types than tonsils and are easier to get responses from both RNA vaccines and novel ones(to most
individuals) such as Yellow Fever Vaccine. We will use them in Aim 1. to optimize the protocols for flu and SARS-
CoV-2 RNA vaccines, and specifically to determine how well organoid responses compare with available studies
in live humans, using our available reagents for T and B cell responses. An even deeper exploration of the BCR
and TCR repertoire will be achieved by sequence analysis, which the Boyd and Davis groups are very
experienced at. In Aim 2 we will focus on getting complete T and B cell responses with the Yellow Fever vaccine,
currently producing only IgM antibodies. In Aim 3, we will take advantage of promising results we have obtained
showing that a highly multimerized peptide-MHC reagent (60-mer) can stain specific T cells in fixed sections, as
can a reagent for specific B cells. These would be a very valuable reagents to interrogate specific lymphocytes
in the most standard type of clinical specimen. In Aim 4, we are teaming up with Drs. Kuo and Blish to use lung
and spleen organoids from the same donors to see any form of cooperativity when we infect the lungs with
influenza or SARS-CoV-2. Since we can see infiltration and rejection with co-incubated skin and tonsils/spleen
from unmatched donors, we are confident that there will cooperativity, as we expect antigen loaded dendritic
cells will migrate from infected lungs and trigger a response in nearby spleen organoids. Lastly, in Aim 5 we
suspect that there are distinct differences in the immune responses of inbred mice and humans, and so have
recently started make mouse spleen organoids so that we can analyze their vaccine responses alongside human
spleens. With the advanced single cell analysis tools available it should be relatively straightforward to identify
differences. We can then follow up those differences with gene editing using CRISPR-Cas9, as we have done
recently. We will also serve as a resource for all three of the main projects, using gene editing and other methods
with organoids for Dr. Wang and Khatri’s projects, as well has interrogating spleen organoids from high and low
BMI individuals in collaboration with those projects and for quickly testing novel immunogens with Dr. Barnes."

the past < 4 years, particularly in the areas of COVID and COVID vaccines. Crotty and Sette published the first
major paper on virus-specific T cell and antibody responses in COVID cases ( > 3,000 citations) and went on to
collaboratively publish several more of the most influential T cell, B cell, and immune memory papers on COVID
and COVID vaccines. The adaptive immune system is important for control of most viral infections. The three
fundamental components of the adaptive immune system are B cells (the source of antibodies), CD4+ T cells,
and CD8+ T cells. The armamentarium of B cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells has differing roles in different
viral infections, and in vaccines, and thus it has been critical to directly study adaptive immunity to SARS2
(SARS2) to understand COVID. The COVID pandemic has been a historic disaster, with over 1 million American
deaths and millions of deaths and billions of infections around the world, counterweighted by the exceptionally
efficient development of COVID vaccines which had remarkable efficacy and have saved over 15 million lives in
less than two years. In 2023 COVID remains a major American public health problem and global health problem,
with COVID being the #3 cause of death in the USA in 2022, and in the USA there were over 1.6 million confirmed
new cases of COVID in the month of January 2023 alone. Improvements in controlling COVID remain somewhat
impaired by our limited understanding of immune memory and upper airways immunity to SARS2. The
overarching focus connecting the three Projects in this LJI CCHI renewal proposal is immune memory, with
emphasis on COVID, highlighted by three overall LJI CCHI themes: (1) understanding immune memory in
humans from blood samples, rich in complexities; (2) understanding human upper airways T and B cell biology
and memory; and (3) COVID immunobiology, including breakthrough infections, differences between COVID
vaccines, and immunity relatedness to other respiratory viral infections of humans. These three themes are
explored in depth in Projects 1-3 and the Clinical Core."

 SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) remains a fundamental threat to global health and a leading cause of death. Here,
we will address a number of important outstanding questions in the field of T cell memory to SARS2. Accordingly,
we’ve established novel donor cohorts, including the Multiple Vaccinations and Infections (MVI) Cohort, with
over 450 donors enrolled in an ongoing longitudinal study (total of 8 years). These samples reflect the real-life
evolution of memory responses, from donors with up to 5 distinct immunizations and up to 4 different infections.
The Breakthrough Infection (BTI) Cohort includes donors who provided large blood donations (leukapheresis)
during the Delta and Omicron waves, and on-going recruitment as new variant waves arise. The Discordant
Pairs (DP) cohort enrolled people sharing living arrangements where one individual experienced BTI infection,
while the other tested negative.
 First, we will determine the evolution of memory T cell responses over repeated exposures and vaccinations
in a real-life study spanning several years, using a multifaceted approach. We hypothesize that a history of
immunization plus infection is associated with broad responses against antigens beyond S (spike), indicating a
qualitative advantage in T cell responses. We will also consider the alternative, that previous immunizations
imprint T cell responses and a pre-existing S response inhibits development of T cell responses against other
SARS2 antigens. We will also study long term evolution of T cell memory responses as a function of type and
number of exposures. We hypothesize that we will observe progressive functional maturation of memory T cells.
Alternatively, we might observe progressive exhaustion and loss of functionality. We will also measure T cell
memory longevity as a function of type and number of exposures. Finally, we will assess the impact of age on
real-life evolution of SARS2-specific memory T cells in the context of repeated vaccinations and reinfections, by
comparing responses between donors aged 20-39, 40-59, and 60 and over.
 We will further determine memory T cell responses in the BTI cohort utilizing apheresis samples collected in
a shorter pre/post-infection time frame, leveraging knowing the exposure window and variant wave of exposure.
We will probe if broad responses are detected against antigens beyond S, or if a pre-existing S response inhibits
development of responses to other antigens. Further, is the epitope repertoire modulated with new, variant-
specific epitopes being recognized? We will also determine SARS2-specific T cell responses from donors in the
DP cohort. To explain why SARS2 exposed donors do not develop overt infection, we hypothesize that they
might be higher vaccine responders; might be associated with previous asymptomatic infections and/or high
levels of pre-existing immunity; and/or might have experienced an abortive infection. Finally, we will test the
hypothesis that BTIs are associated with selective expansion of different T cell memory subpopulations, defined
by varied antigen sensitivity and cross-reactivity patterns, and defined by different methodologies."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) caused more than 110,000 deaths in 2017 making it the sixth most common cause
of death. With an estimated lifetime risk of 40% in the U.S. population and an estimated cost of care exceeding
$200 billion, ADRD is burdensome for individuals and their families, and costly to society. While work is
increasingly determining risk and resilience factors for ADRD, little is known about causes of preclinical AD.
Life course researchers have posited that a lifetime of stressors can accumulate to cause increased incidence
of symptoms consistent with preclinical AD including changes to memory and early stages of cognitive
impairment. In creating the first and only cognitive monitoring study of World Trade Center responders
(R01 AG049953; PI, Clouston), we posited that chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a relatively
common disorder characterized by intrusive memories of past trauma accompanied by a heightened
stress response, might help to provide a unique mechanism linking lifetime stressors with later onset
of cognitive decline reminiscent of ADRD. Those data sought to examine the extent to which childhood
exposures, midlife exposures, genetic differences, and later-life changes in health would help to explain
cognitive symptoms of preclinical AD in World Trade Center responders. While we now understand that PTSD
predicts increased risk of cognitive and physical symptoms consistent with preclinical AD, the mechanisms of
action for this association remain opaque. In a recent pilot study, we found that WTC responders have
increased plasma neurofilament-light and plasma tau (which was associated with memory in this sample), and
also identified a strong association between PTSD and changes to plasma amyloid-b burden. We now posit
that PTSD may either cause an Alzheimer’s pathological cascade with one result being cognitive dysfunction in
domains of fluid cognition including memory. This study seeks to examine, using longitudinal data, the extent
to which PTSD might trigger an AD neuropathological cascade. However, since responders are very young to
be experiencing ADRD, we additionally hypothesize that PSTD may reduce cognitive reserve thereby
amplifying the effects of extant neuropathology. Finally, we propose an alternative hypothesis stating that
inhaled nanoparticulate matter exposures, which some responders reported while at the WTC may have
increased the burden of a known neurotoxin with one result being increased risk of neuropathological changes
including increased tauopathy.

10824237,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Family formation processes, including marriage, contraception, and childbearing, are among the most im-
portant factors shaping the health and wellbeing of families and children. The substantial, long-term conse-
quences of the parental family for children's family formation outcomes are among the most well-documented
forces of change in the social sciences. However, a powerful factor has been overlooked—parental mental
health. Not only are mental disorders highly prevalent the world over, but parental mental disorders are known
to have powerful consequences for children, likely to shape their later-life family formation processes. We will
address this important gap in research by integrating parental mental disorders into intergenerational models of
family formation using a 24-year, prospective family panel study. To advance knowledge of these intergenera-
tional processes using these new measures, we aim to: (1) Generate the first estimates of the role of parental
mental disorders in shaping their children's subsequent marriage, contraception, and childbearing; (2) Use
DNA-based polygenic risk scores from mothers, fathers, and their children to assess omitted genetic variable
bias in these intergenerational models; and (3) Create and evaluate new prospective measures of sexual risk-
taking and substance use mechanisms likely to link parental mental disorders to their children's marriage, con-
traceptive use, and childbearing.
 The results will provide three significant advances. One is the first general population investigation of the
intergenerational influence of parental mental disorders on children's marriage, contraception, and childbear-
ing. A second is the first study of the genetic contribution to the intergenerational influences of parental mental
disorders on family formation. To date nearly all population models of intergenerational influences on family
formation are forced to conclude that unobserved genetic similarities may account for observed associations.
We will introduce a new generation of intergenerational research—designs that integrate genetic propensities.
The third is a significant advance in our understanding of the role played by children's premarital sex, sex with-
out contraception, and substance use in linking parental factors to children's family formation, as these events
could mediate this relationship. These steps will significantly advance our understanding of the intergenera-
tional influences on the dynamics of marriage, contraception, and childbearing, all of which are crucial for
health and wellbeing."

Human immunology has changed radically in the past decade, accelerated, in part, by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite this progress, we still lack knowledge of how to specifically induce optimal vaccine-induced T and B cell
responses. One major gap in human immunology is the inability to precisely interrogate individual immune
pathways in antigen-specific T and B cell responses through gain- or loss-of-function. Such studies have
remained largely the domain of mouse immunology. However, humans are routinely treated with specific immune
modifying therapeutics. Many of these same individuals also receive vaccines that allow examination of a specific
adaptive immune response with known timing and well-defined antigens. Thus, it is now possible to capture the
human experiment where the human immune system has been specifically perturbed by a therapeutic while
another immune stimulus, such as a vaccine, is delivered. With well-designed patient cohorts selected for receipt
of drugs that target a pathway of interest, key mechanistic gain- and loss-of-function type studies can be
performed in humans. Here, we focus on the PD-1 inhibitory receptor pathway and vaccine-induced immunity.
PD-1 is highly expressed in germinal centers (GC) by GC T follicular helper (TFH) cells, and the PD-1 ligands
PD-L1 and PD-L2 are expressed by GC B cells. PD-1 is also upregulated by activated CD8 T cells during priming
in humans. The role of the PD-1 pathway in human vaccine immunity, however, is largely unknown. Our
preliminary data generated during the previous U19 cycle demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with
promising data on effects of PD-1 on vaccine-induced TFH responses. Thus, the studies proposed will address a
major gap in knowledge in human immunology: how does PD-1, expressed highly by vaccine induced immune
cells, regulate vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immunity. We will test the central hypothesis that disruption
of the PD-1 pathway through precision immunotherapy leads to changes in magnitude, differentiation state,
repertoire, quality, and memory for GC-dependent TFH and B cell responses as well as GC-independent CD8 T
cell responses. First, we will test whether loss of PD-1 signals alters the quality and/or magnitude of GC-
associated CD4 T cell and B cell responses to vaccination. Second, we will ask whether loss of PD-1 signals
alters CD8 T cell priming, repertoire and memory CD8 T cell differentiation following vaccination. This work will
provide new insights into how a key immune regulatory pathway controls vaccine induced immunity using
“mouse-like” loss-of-function studies in humans. This work will have implications for improving vaccines and for
the fundamental regulation of immunological memory in humans. Moreover, this approach could be a platform
for future studies capturing specific human immune perturbation to interrogate new immunobiology. By its nature
Project 3 will be highly interactive with Project 1 and 2 and all Cores. Core B will generate samples used in this
Project, and this Project will use Core C services. Projects 1, 2 and 3 will synergize and interact extensively to
understand PD-1-based immune perturbation in humans."

The Candida Genome Database (CGD) is considered THE resource for comprehensive information about the
human fungal pathogen Candida albicans and related Candida species, and is widely used by the Candida
research community, who relies upon CGD in their everyday work. C. albicans is the third or fourth most common
nosocomial bloodstream isolate; mortality rates are high (35% or greater) and treatment is costly. It is thus vital
that there is a comprehensive and up-to-date resource for researchers investigating the biology and
pathogenesis of C. albicans, as such a resource accelerates their research. The central challenge for any
community database, in this era of high throughput technologies becoming widely available, is to turn the flood
of data into knowledge, which the community can access, use and build upon. A research community is clearly
best served by collection of all relevant data in a single location, followed by manual, expert curation of those
data, coupled with tools to allow users to search and navigate the data in an intuitive fashion. Most of the data
available in CGD are not available from any other site, and no other site performs curation of the C. albicans
literature. We re-use software wherever possible, writing our own only when necessary. This philosophy has
served us well, in that we have built CGD into an indispensable resource with modest staff, and we will continue
to apply this model going forward. In this renewal for CGD we propose to build on our previous successes. We
will expand the large-scale data types stored at CGD, curate the datasets, and provide new tools to analyze and
visualize these data. We will also use these high-throughput data to improve the sequences and primary
annotations for Candida genomes – reference genomes provide the fundamental platform upon which a
community’s research builds, and it is vital that they be accurate and correctly annotated. We will perform real-
time curation of the experimental literature, capturing gene names, mutant phenotypes, Gene Ontology Terms,
etc., from papers as they are published, so that at a glance a bench biologist can find the salient, up-to-date
information about any gene to which their research leads them. Finally, we will provide support to the Candida
scientific community, ensuring that we are continuing to serve their needs as the indispensable resource that we
have become. Together, successful completion of these aims will support and accelerate research into fungal
pathogenesis, and thus have a positive impact on human health."

 Youth trajectories of tobacco use are of critical importance in the future of public health. Most tobacco
use begins in adolescence and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to long-term tobacco use. While
cigarette smoking significantly declined among adolescents over the past decade, overall tobacco/nicotine use
actually increased by some measures, primarily due to increased rates of use of electronic nicotine delivery
systems (ENDS). These changes in population levels of adolescent tobacco use are of critical importance in
predicting tobacco control challenges and opportunities in the next decade. As the scientific debate unfolds
regarding ENDS health effects, adolescents nationwide are learning about tobacco products and attempting to
rectify conflicting information to create and refine their own beliefs regarding these products.
 At the same time, youth are increasingly living their lives filtered through social media account
participation. Marketers are well aware of this fact and act to influence youth to purchase their products.
Tobacco marketers are certainly no exception. Social media marketing is particularly important to examine as it
is a prevalent source of adolescent exposure that is amenable to policy change. Social media marketing differs
from other forms of marketing in that it exploits participatory facilitation, algorithmic coordination, context-
specific promotions, real-world enmeshment, and seamless integration with purchasing opportunities. Although
some research has examined this issue, there are important methodological concerns that may lead to flawed
or incomplete understanding of the relationships involved and hinder the development of policies or other
approaches to reduce the influence of social media marketing on youth ENDS use. We will address limitations
in prior research by using both longitudinal data-adaptive, semiparametric estimators and a causal inference
approach. We will focus on two risk perceptions: harmfulness and addictiveness. The degree to which risk
beliefs act as mediators of the effects of social media marketing on use is unclear. Effective ENDS control
strategies for adolescents require a more comprehensive understanding of how attitudes change over time and
the potential impact of social media marketing on these changes
 The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) dataset provides a unique opportunity to
examine youth beliefs about tobacco products, marketing exposure, and patterns of tobacco use among
adolescents in the United States longitudinally. The current study will examine underutilized, recent Waves to
examine the impact of online ENDS marketing on use with longitudinal data-adaptive, semiparametric
estimators and to examine risk perceptions as potential mediators explaining the effects of adolescent
marketing exposure on ENDS use with a causal inference approach."

 The heart is now recognized as an important organ in the regulation of systemic lipid homeostasis;
however, our understanding of the molecular basis remains limited. It was recently shown that Wingless (Wg)
signaling in the heart controls systemic lipid homeostasis. However, how cardiac Wg signaling controls this
process is unknown. In a genetic screen in Drosophila, we discovered that the Snail family of transcription
factors (Sna TFs) act in the heart to regulate systemic lipid metabolism. Our preliminary results also showed
that Wg signaling in the heart activates the cardiac expression of Sna TFs. These findings led us to
hypothesize that a Wg-Sna TF axis in the heart regulates lipid homeostasis in a systemic manner. This
hypothesis will be tested in Aim 1. Building on our previous proteomic analysis of fly hemolymph (blood), we
further discovered that a soluble protein thioester-containing protein 2 (Tep2), a secreted protein previously
unknown to be involved in lipid metabolism, is up-regulated in the heart by Sna signaling and secreted to the
circulation. Our further preliminary data showed that Tep2 mutation alters systemic lipid levels and that both
Sna TF and Tep2 control TGF signaling in the fat body, in which TGF is known to be implicated in lipid
metabolism. We therefore hypothesize that Tep2 secreted from heart to circulation serves as a functional
effector of Wg-Sna axis in regulating systemic lipid homeostasis by modulating TGF pathway in fat body. This
hypothesis will be tested in Aim 2. Furthermore, we found that high fat diet (HFD) induces the cardiac
expression of Wg and Sna TFs. Based on our preliminary observation that activation of Sna TFs decreases
systemic lipid levels, we hypothesize that a cardiac WgSna TF–Tep2 axis protects against HFD-induced
obesity. This hypothesis will be tested in Aim 3. Together, this proposal will reveal novel insights into the heart
control of normal systemic lipid homeostasis and provide knowledge that may help guide future therapeutics
for human obesity and its comorbidities."

Circadian rhythm disruption, as marked by circadian rhythm variability, eveningness (i.e., preference for later
sleep timing), and delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSPD, characterized by eveningness) are common
among adults with bipolar disorder (BD). Indeed, 65% of BD adults meet diagnostic criteria for DSPD during a
depressive episode, as compared to rates of 0.2-1.7% in the general population. Importantly, DSPD,
eveningness, and circadian rhythm variability are the most robust predictors of a poorer clinical course in BD,
including greater functional impairment and relapse to mood episodes across 1-5 years. The impact of an
episode in BD is profound; 60% of those experiencing their first episode fail to regain previous functioning at 2
years; over 50% of BD people experience disability; life expectancy is reduced by an average of 8-12 years.
Efficacious therapies such as Interpersonal and Social Rhythms Therapy (IPSRT) seek to improve outcomes in
BD by indirectly targeting the circadian system through stabilization of social rhythms. In this project, we build
vertically upon IPSRT by testing the mechanisms of a strategic intervention that directly targets the circadian
system disruptions observed in BD—low-dose afternoon supplemental melatonin plus time in bed scheduling.
With demonstrated efficacy for DSPD, this strategic intervention is low-burden to person, stabilizes
dysregulated sleep patterns, improves sleep, increases morningness, and normalizes circadian timing. The
advantages of melatonin as a strategic therapy for BD are significant: (1) available over-the-counter; (2)
inexpensive (~7 cents per pill); (3) easily administered/low patient burden; and (4) safe, with few side effects.
The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of low-dose afternoon melatonin plus time in bed
scheduling relative to control (sleep hygiene education plus placebo pill) for DSPD in adults with BD and
clinically significant depressive symptoms to determine its engagement of the novel mechanistic target of
circadian timing. Specific aims are as follows: AIM 1: Determine the effect of low-dose afternoon melatonin
plus time in bed scheduling (n=25) vs. sleep hygiene education plus placebo pill (n=25) on the primary
mechanistic probe of circadian timing as measured by the gold-standard biomarker, dim light melatonin onset
(DLMO); AIM 2: Evaluate DLMO advance as a predictor of change in depression symptoms (self-reported and
Ecological Momentary Assessment, EMA); Evaluate exploratory mechanisms (increase in morningness and
reduction in sleep variability) as predictors of reduction in depression symptoms (self-reported and EMA); AIM
3. Evaluate DLMO advance as a predictor of exploratory outcomes (total sleep time, sleep-related impairment,
mania symptoms). Objective, in-home assessment of circadian timing and sleep enables mechanistic testing
focused on novel biomarkers. This proposal is consistent with NIMH Strategy 3 of targeting putative
mechanisms linking the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domain of the arousal/regulatory systems (e.g.,
circadian and sleep regulation) to poor outcomes in this impactful disorder."

 When a new route is learned, what happens in the hippocampus? How fast do these changes occur? Are
all hippocampal subfields involved in memory encoding? Decades of research have shown that the hippocampus
is necessary for spatial memory. However, the neural foundation of spatial learning and memory and its link to
hippocampal architecture remain major study topics. According to animal research, learning alters the functional,
chemical, and structural properties of hippocampal cells. Unfortunately, we know considerably less about
humans' microstructural basis of learning and memory. An accurate assessment of learning-induced
hippocampal neuroplasticity —the ability of the hippocampus to modify its function and structure in response to
information—would significantly enhance human memory research. For decades, we have lacked the
noninvasive technology necessary to evaluate neuroplasticity with the same biological precision as animals.
Diffusion Magnetic Resonance imaging (dMRI) holds the most promise among non-invasive technology to reveal
the microstructural substrate of learning and memory in humans. Initial studies in healthy humans have shown
that dMRI can be sensitive to changes during learning. But technological limitations in gradient technology have
diminished the expectations of what the diffusion MRI signal can reveal in term of specificity to the different
cellular processes that are thought to be involved in neuroplasticity.
 This K99/R00 proposal takes advantage of newly available ultra-high gradient strength dMRI at the MGH
Martinos Center to create a noninvasive marker of learning-induced neuroplasticity in the human hippocampus
subfields during human navigation with a high level of biological specificity. I will combine behavioral testing,
high-resolution functional MRI, state-of-the-art multi-compartment gray matter dMRI models, and ultra-high
gradient strength (500 mT/m) high-resolution dMRI data acquired with our center's BRAIN Initiative-funded
Connectome 2.0 MRI scanner to achieve a unified view of the structural-functional response of the human
hippocampus in spatial memory. The in vivo neuroplasticity marker developed in this proposal might be used as
a diagnostic tool in Alzheimer's disease to detect early indications of pathological hippocampus remodeling or to
assess the efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) techniques for memory impairment repair. The project makes
use of the vast expertise of my mentors and collaborators in cognitive neuroscience, high-gradient strength
dMRI, hippocampal anatomy, and high-resolution functional MRI. The candidate aims to get the necessary skills
to begin an independent long-term research program focused on developing the next generation of in vivo
functional and diffusion MRI technologies to connect cellular-specific information with cognition and brain
functioning. The training component of the K99/R00 award will enrich the candidate's prior strong expertise in
mathematical modeling, diffusion image acquisition, and reconstruction, with complementary skills in behavioral
testing, fMRI analysis, hippocampus anatomy, and the validation of dMRI biomarkers of brain microstructure."

 It is widely accepted that tumors are highly heterogeneous. There is a subpopulation of cells in a tumor,
called tumor-initiating cell, that can be isolated and are able to self-renew, differentiate and form the bulk of the
tumor. Many cancers don't respond to traditional chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and those that initially
respond, often relapse. Conventional therapy only attacks proliferating cells, leaving behind a pool of resistant
stem-like cells that are able to regenerate the whole tumor. Understanding mechanisms that regulate tumor-
initiating activity will lead to designing and developing effective therapeutics. Our lab has demonstrated for the
first time that the nutrient sensor O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) regulates cancer-initiating cells in vitro and in
vivo. Reducing OGT, genetically or pharmacologically, blocks mammosphere formation in vitro and reduced
epithelial-mesechymal markers (EMT), cancer stem cell markers. Importantly, overexpression of OGT, in
multiple breast cancer cells, increases cancer stem cell markers including NANOG, increases mammosphere
formation in vitro and increases tumor initiation in vivo. In this proposal, we hope to uncover molecular
mechanism by which OGT regulates tumor initiation, by in part, understanding OGT interactome and O-
GlcNAcome in breast cancer tumor initiating cells. This information will allow us to identify novel therapeutic
targets in treating cancer and reverse drug resistance. Based on our preliminary results, the central hypothesis
of this application is that the nutrient sensor O-GlcNAc transferase plays a fundamental role in breast cancer

cells (CSCs) and providing a framework for understanding how cancer alterations in metabolic pathways
regulate core self-renewal signaling that controls CSC maintenance. In Aim #1, we will determine the

OGT interacting proteins and O-GlcNAcylated protein in tumor initiating cells to identify novel pathways and
regulators of tumor-initiating ability. The final aim will evaluate the role of OGT in regulating tumor-initiating
activity in vivo. Importantly, we will test novel OGT inhibitors in preclinical cancer models and test whether
OGT targeting drugs as potential anti-tumor initiation cell therapeutic strategy against breast cancer growth
and metastasis in vivo. These studies will further our understanding of how metabolic reprogramming in cancer
cells connects at the molecular level to tumor initiating cells and will create mechanistic understanding of how
nutrient sensor OGT can couple to cancer initiation pathways and establish OGT as therapeutic target for

10809741,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Pulmonary T cells are critical for host protection from influenza A virus (IAV) infections. While current
understanding of influenza immunity is focused on conventional MHC-restricted T cells that recognize peptide antigens,
unconventional innate-like T cell subsets, such as CD1d-restricted invariant natural killer T (NKT) cells, are emerging as
integral components of the respiratory immune system where they play both a protective and immunopathological role in
lung disease. This is principally through their production of large amounts of cytokines in barrier organs like the lung where
NKT cells preferentially accumulate. Although NKT cell activities are thought to make up a substantial portion of influenza
immunity, relatively little is known about their impact on human infections due to a lack of suitable animal models. The
current proposal seeks to address this knowledge gap using swine, which offer an excellent translational model to determine
the role NKT cells play in shaping human influenza immunity. Using our extensive expertise in porcine NKT cells and the
swine influenza challenge model, we propose three aims: Aim 1 will examine the significance of NKT cells as an important
host factor contributing to IAV susceptibility. We have already created NKT cell-deficient CD1d knockout (KO) pigs and
discovered that they shed less virus than NKT cell-intact pigs. Aim 2 will use the same pig stock to determine how NKT
cells shape the pre-existing immunity afforded by inactivated and modified live virus vaccines. Addressing this question is
important to inform vaccinologists since NKT cells have previously been found to generate immune responses that could
stimulate durable protection against viral infections. Aim 3 will use our CD1d-KO pigs to determine whether NKT cells
modulate vaccine associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD), which is a dangerous condition caused by the use of
inactivated IAV vaccines containing a virus of the same hemagglutinin subtype as the subsequent challenge strain, but with
substantial antigenic shift. This induces non-neutralizing IgG Abs that enhances virus uptake into the target cells. These
independent but interconnected aims strongly align with the goals of this funding opportunity: to develop novel models that
will accurately reflect influenza immunity in humans, including to better mimic pre-existing immunity for vaccine responses
and to better understand special high-risk human populations. Our findings should be of considerable value for reducing
influenza transmission and improving vaccine safety and efficiency as there are several therapeutic options to modulate the
frequency and function of NKT cells."

 Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs, e.g., sodas, sports drinks, “fruit” drinks, bottled teas, coffees) have
emerged as a key dietary risk factor for obesity and type 2 diabetes. We propose a double-randomized
controlled trial of a multilevel workplace intervention that combines an employer-sponsored sales ban on SSBs
with brief motivational counseling to support reduced consumption. Health systems and schools are
increasingly adopting sales bans of SSBs and replacing them with healthier options. Employer-based brief
counseling interventions, despite being low-cost and highly efficacious for alcohol and tobacco reduction, have
received limited attention as a strategy to reduce SSB consumption. A multilevel intervention combining both
strategies may be the most effective: the brief counseling intervention can increase motivation to reduce SSBs
despite cravings while the sales ban removes SSB-related availability and cues from the workplace. Our pilot
data strongly support the rationale for combining these interventions and for the mediating role of SSB
cravings.
 The proposed trial tests this multilevel intervention, called the workplace Metabolic Health Improvement
Program (MHIP), in partnership with a Northern California-based academic healthcare system, Sutter Health
(enrolling N=700 employees on N=16 hospital campuses). The first randomization will assign hospital
campuses to the employer-sponsored sales ban on SSBs (8 sites) versus control (8 sites). The second
randomization will assign employees to the brief counseling intervention versus control, split equally across
sales ban and control sites. We assess anthropometrics and blood at baseline and 12 months. The primary
outcome is change in central obesity (e.g., waist circumference). Secondary outcomes include changes in SSB
consumption, Body Mass Index (BMI), serum insulin sensitivity (homeostatic model assessment [HOMA]), and
lipids. Dietary and beverage composition is assessed remotely using the Automated Self-Administered 24-
Hour recall (ASA-24) at baseline, 6 and 12 months.
 The first aim of this research is to assess the independent effects of the brief counseling intervention
and workplace SSB sales ban on changes in primary and secondary outcomes. The second aim is to test the
multilevel effects of combining the brief intervention and SSB sales ban on outcomes. A third, exploratory aim
examines whether reductions in SSB cravings mediate the effects of the multilevel intervention on outcomes.
If effective, the employer-sponsored multilevel intervention will offer an efficient, scalable strategy for
preventing obesity and metabolic disease in millions of American working adults."
10809630,"Oncogenic tyrosine kinases (OTKs) such as FLT3(ITD) and JAK2(V617F) induce acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), respectively. OTKs may be
accompanied by “additional” mutations (e.g., TET2, DNMT3A) complicating genetic/epigenetic
signature. Selective OTK inhibitors (OTKi) are developed against FLT3(ITD)-positive AMLs and
JAK2(V617F)-positive MPNs, but complete remissions were rare in OTKi-treated patients, and
after initial response the disease progressed often in to more malignant stage.
 FLT3(ITD)-positive AMLs and JAK2(V617F)-positive MPNs accumulate lethal DNA double-
strand breaks (DSBs). DSBs are repaired by two major mechanisms, BRCA-mediated
homologous recombination (HR) and DNA-PK –mediated non-homologous end-joining (D-
NHEJ). HR and D-NHEJ repair DSBs in proliferating cells and D-NHEJ plays a major role in
quiescent cells. PARP1–dependent back-up NHEJ (B-NHEJ) works in proliferating and
quiescent cells. FLT3(ITD) and JAK2(V617F)-positive AML/MPN stem cells are usually resistant
to DSBs because these OTKs modulate DNA repair pathways to promote survival.
 Cancer-specific defects in DSB repair create the opportunity to employ synthetic lethality,
e.g. elimination of BRCA1/2-mutated cancer cells by PARP inhibitor (PARPi). We reported that
OTKis induce HR and D-NHEJ deficiencies, which sensitize quiescent and proliferating
FLT3(ITD)/JAK2(V617F)-positive AML/MPN stem cells to synthetic lethality triggered by PARPi.
 However, our recent reports and preliminary data strongly suggest that “additional”
mutations (e.g., in TET2, DNMT3A) can change FLT3(ITD) and JAK2(V617F)-positive
AML/MPN cells sensitivity to OTKi + PARPi. Therefore in Specific Aim #1 we propose to identify
“additional” mutations and mechanisms which affect sensitivity of FLT3(ITD) and JAK2(V617F)-
positive cells to OTKi+PARPi-mediated synthetic lethality.
 We also reported and obtained preliminary data that bone marrow microenvironment (BMM)
induces resistance to OTKi + PARPi treatment. Therefore we will pinpoint BMM-related
obstacles for OTKi + PARPi-mediated synthetic lethality and apply BMM inhibitor (BMMi) in
Specific Aim #2: Overcoming the protective effect of BMM against OTKi + PARPi treatment.
 Finally, we will test therapeutic potential of OTKi + PARPi +/- BMMi against AMLs/MPNs
xenografts carrying mutations favoring synthetic lethal effect in Specific Aim #3. Therapeutic
effect of OTKi + PARPi +/- BMMi against AMLs/MPNs carrying specific “driver” mutations
[FLT3(ITD/TKD), JAK2(V617F)] and “additional” mutations (e.g., TET2)."
10809634,"Dr. Amy Byers’ research is predominately focused on suicide prevention in older Veterans. This work is
highly relevant to and has very high impact on Veterans and VA healthcare. Veterans 50 years and older have
the highest number of lives lost to suicide and make up the majority (> 70%) of the Veteran population. Older
adults and, in particular, older Veterans accumulate a significant amount of life experiences, including suffering
multiple comorbidities, losses, and traumas, that impact their mental and physical well-being. Even further
adding to the complexity, mental health care often occurs in non-mental health settings under the influence of
personal and society notions and stigmas about mental illness and about aging. Dr. Byers’ Lab is uniquely
positioned to conduct research at this level of complexity. Dr. Byers has developed a deep, clinically relevant
understanding of the nature of mental health in late life, its course, treatment and impact. Her research covers
multiple sub-areas of late-life mental health, i.e., late-life suicide, late-life posttraumatic stress disorder, mental
health services use with age, geriatric depression, and gerontological biostatistics. In particular, understanding
suicide-related outcomes in older adults/Veterans requires substantially different conceptual and methodologic
considerations, which Dr. Byers and her team are uniquely qualified to undertake. There are 4 over-arching
research areas and Aims that Dr. Byers will actively pursue during the proposed Research Career Scientist
Award period: 1) To characterize and identify patterns of health services use and diagnostic profiles at a
national level among older adults/Veterans who have experienced late-life suicide or mental health disorders;
2) To identify predictors of late-life suicide; 3) To advance late-life suicide and mental health research in
prominent health disparity and vulnerable groups; and 4) To advance suicide and neuropsychiatric research in
Veterans incarcerated and returning to community in later life. In summary, the first 3 Aims are supported by
an on-going VA CSR&D Merit Award (I01 CX001119; PI: Byers). Aim 2 and 3 are further supported by a
Genius Award (PI: Byes) from the UCSF Older Americans Independence Center (NIA-funded Pepper Center).
Aim 4 is supported by a NIMH Multi-PI R01 grant in collaboration with Dr. Lisa Barry from University of
Connecticut (MH117604; Multi-PI: Byers/Barry). Additionally, Dr. Byers and Dr. Barry were recently awarded a
NIMH/NIA Supplement to the parent grant to determine the burden of Alzheimer’s disease and related
diseases in older adults/Veterans with a recent history of incarceration. There are many seminal contributions
by Dr. Byers’ Lab in terms of highly cited papers in high impact journals in support of these on-going activities.
To name a few, she was the first to determine the high occurrence of late-life mood and anxiety disorders at a
national level, first to determine and characterize nationally that the majority (~70%) of older adults with mood
or anxiety disorders did not use mental health services, first to identify comorbidity profiles in Veterans 65
years and older who were last seen in primary care prior to a suicide attempt, first to determine in a national
cohort that risk of suicide attempt was increased in Veterans recently diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment
or dementia (in press at JAMA Psychiatry), first to provide evidence that hormone therapy is an indicator of
suicide risk among midlife to older women Veterans (even independent of psychoactive drugs), and seminal
work showing a nearly 5-fold greater risk of a subsequent suicide attempt in older Veterans transitioning from
prison to community. Dr. Byers is investigating other unique patterns of potential markers and predictors of
late-life suicide risk (supported by I01 CX001119), including “high-risk” medication use (i.e., benzodiazepines,
sedative-hypnotics, opioids, antidepressants, antiepileptics, and antipsychotics) and polypharmacy patterns,
and conducting seminal research to determine specific medications causally linked to risk of suicide in older
Veterans. Moreover, she is actively pursuing more research on vulnerable groups (female, minority, homeless,
and PTSD), including Veterans transitioning from incarceration to community in later life."

The underlying brain defects in Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) are not well understood. We have been
investigating the specific circuit alterations that lead to a variety of symptoms in FXS, including attention deficit,
anxiety, hyperarousal, sensory hypersensitivity and delayed learning. We focus on FXS, the most common
inherited cause of autism and intellectual disability, because most investigators use the same Fmr1 knockout
mouse model to investigate it, and because it lacks neuropathological features that often confound
investigations in other neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., severe epilepsy, neuronal migration defects, etc.).
We strive to overcome limitations of previous studies by comparing the performance of humans and mice with
FXS on analogous behavioral tasks. Our goal is to identify shared deficits in sensory processing and learning
across both species that will hopefully improve outcomes of future clinical trials in FXS. Here, we will
determine the impact of sensory distractors on behavioral performance in both humans and mice using a visual
discrimination task. We will also identify specific alterations in population dynamics of pyramidal neurons and
different subtypes of inhibitory interneurons that are responsible for deficits in sensory discrimination in Fmr1
knockout mice. Building on our recently published study in Nature Neuroscience (Goel et al., 2018), we will
address the following important questions: 1. Does distraction worsen performance in a sensory discrimination
task in Fmr1 knockout mice and in adult subjects with FXS? (Aim 1)? 2. Is the firing of parvalbumin (PV)- and
vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons disrupted in Fmr1 knockout mice during the
sensory discrimination task, especially in the presence of sensory distractors? (Aim 2A)? 3. Can silencing VIP
interneurons (or exciting PV neurons) with DREADDs rescue behavioral performance in Fmr1 knockout mice?
(Aim 2B)? 4. Do mice and humans with FXS share similar deficits in neural oscillations (Aim 3)? The mouse
studies will be performed in the laboratory of established FXS investigator Carlos Portera-Cailliau (PI) at
UCLA. Craig Erickson (co-I), who runs the world’s 3rd largest FXS clinic at the University of Cincinnati, will
conduct the human studies. The experimental design exploits cutting edge in vivo imaging techniques (e.g.,
chemogenetics, in vivo two-photon calcium imaging, Cre-Lox genetics, silicon probe recordings, phase-
amplitude coupling analysis of EEG) and seeks to address important knowledge gaps in ASD pathogenesis."
10809756,"Projections from the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) to the amygdala, its basolateral nucleus (BLA), specifically,
play an essential role in context representation in the amygdala during encoding of fear memory extinction.
However, synaptic and network-level mechanisms by which vHPC-amygdala projections may control the function
of the amygdala and amygdala-dependent fear-related behaviors are largely unknown. Combining the use of
chemogenetic and optogenetic techniques with ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology, tract tracing with viral
vectors and behavioral training and testing, we will explore the functional roles of vHPC-amygdala projections in
conditioned fear and fear extinction at synaptic and circuitry-specific levels. In Aim 1 we will investigate how the
mechanisms of synaptic plasticity in vHPC projections to subnuclei of the amygdala affect the signal flow in
neural circuits of fear conditioning and extinction. Optogeneticaly activating vHPC-amygdala projections, we will
record from neurons in different subdivisions of the amygdala in slices from control, fear-conditioned and fear-
extinguished mice and assay the effects of behavioral training on both excitatory and inhibitory drive in recorded
neurons and their synaptically-driven spike firing output. We will then explore the role of the vHPC-amygdala
pathway in control of fear-related behaviors (Aim 2). Specifically, we will examine the contributions of
behaviorally-induced synaptic plasticity at vHPC inputs to the amygdala, specifically focusing on long-range
GABAergic vHPC-BLA projections (identified by us), to the encoding of context-dependency of fear extinction
memory using chemogenetic tools. We will also systematically explore whether extinction-associated
potentiation of GABAergic synaptic transmission at vHPC-BLA projections may satisfy criteria of synaptic
plasticity and memory (SPM) hypothesis, thus possibly linking these plastic synaptic modifications to the
encoding of context-dependency of fear extinction. Finally (Aim 3), we will investigate the synaptic and neural
circuit-level mechanisms in vHPC-amygdala projections implicated in fear renewal triggered by repeated stress
in fear extinguished mice. We hypothesize that repeated stress may affect the mechanisms of extinction-
triggered synaptic plasticity in vHPC-BLA projections, impairing context representation, and, therefore, possibly
resulting in fear renewal. Our studies could identify specific synaptic mechanisms and neural projections which
could potentially be targeted for therapeutic treatments of disorders implicating dysfunctions of the fear system
of the brain."
10809757,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Excess cognitive dysfunction has been identified in older adult survivors of COVID-19, compared to other
respiratory infections. SARS-CoV-2 may thus adversely impact the brain beyond what the cases of acute stroke,
etc. suggest. Unrecognized brain effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection may impact current brain functioning and
presage future neurodegeneration and overt neurologic dysfunction. However, absent known baseline
functioning, detection of subclinical effects will be confounded by normal variation between cases and controls.
We will therefore leverage detailed pre-pandemic neurocognitive and imaging assessments to characterize
subclinical effects on brain structure and function among a large cohort of younger patients who experienced
mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. We will identify 3 groups utilizing detailed serologic analysis and
novel highly specific SARS-CoV-2 T-cell assays to allow confirmation of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, even in the
setting of COVID-19 vaccination: (1) M ild COVID-19: 35 patients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 who were
NOT hospitalized; (2) Asymptomatic: 35 with laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but no history of
COVID-19 symptoms; and (3) Controls: 70 matched individuals without laboratory or clinical evidence of prior
SARS-CoV-2 infection. All participants were healthy prior to COVID-19, with no comorbid risk factors or brain
imaging abnormality and normal neurocognitive performance. Against this robust quantitative baseline, we will
assess change due to SARS-CoV-2 infection by repeating a suite of neurological assessments, including brain
imaging and assessments of neurocognitive function, mood, anxiety, stress and social isolation due to the
pandemic. In addition to their pre-pandemic baseline, we will assess participants (1) at entry into this proposed
study, (2) 6 months after entry, (3) 18 months after entry and (3) three years after entry, to address the following:
Aim 1 Brain Tissue Effects: Characterize change of macro/microstructure and functional connectivity frompre-
pandemic, among SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and non-infected controls, over three years.
Aim 2 Functional Effects: Assess change in neurocognitive function from pre-pandemic, among SARS-CoV-2
patients, and in non-infected controls, over three years, while accounting for mood, stress and social isolation.
Aim 3 Individual Risk Factors [Exploratory]:Explore whether individual characteristics, such as sex, BMI, SES
and race/ethnicity, modify the associations of SARS-CoV-2 infection with MRI and neurocognitive changes.
Confirming neurological morbidity in mild SARS-CoV-2 will have key implications for screening, care and follow-
up for brain dysfunction among those at risk. Theseproblems would otherwise go unrecognized, despite potential
for long-term, yet-unrecognized morbidity. Our existing sample of previously healthy, young, ethnically diverse
women and men from a high prevalence and high morbidity region, well-characterized prior to the COVID-19
pandemic, uniquely positions us to characterize subclinical brain injury and dysfunction due to SARS-CoV-2."

Digital assays — in which ultra-sensitive molecular measurements are made by performing
millions of parallel experiments in picoliter droplets — have generated much recent enthusiasm
due to their single molecule resolution of RNA, DNA, and proteins, and their robustness to
reaction conditions. These assays have enormous potential for the diagnosis of difficult to
diagnose diseases, such as pancreatic cancer, but are currently confined to laboratory settings
due to the cumbersome instrumentation necessary to generate, control, and measure tens of
millions of independent droplets. To overcome this challenge, we are developing a hybrid
microelectronic / microfluidic chip to ‘unlock’ droplet-based assays for clinical use. Our
microdroplet megascale detector (µMD) can generate and detect the fluorescence of millions of
droplets per second (1000× faster than existing digital approaches), while achieving a 1000x
greater sensitivity than conventional ELISA or ddPCR, using only a conventional cell phone
camera. The key innovation of our approach is borrowed from the telecommunications industry,
wherein we modulate the excitation light with a pseudorandom sequence that enables individual
droplets to be resolved that would otherwise overlap due to the limited frame rate of digital
cameras. Building on the success of our R21, we propose to develop a platform technology to
ultrasensitively quantify proteins, ctDNA, and single EVs in an integrated device, directly in
patient blood, to address critical issues in multimodal diagnostics. In collaboration with the
Abramson Cancer Center and building on prior work together on multi-modal diagnostics, we
focus our attention on Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma-the third leading cause of cancer-
related death in the United States with an overall 5-year survival of only 9%."
10800700,"ApoE is a lipid transport protein enriched in brain and present in three allelic variants (e2, e3, e4).
Homozygosity for the e4 allele (e4/e4) is the main genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, but
ApoE4 carriers also have increased risk for white matter lesions in both vascular cognitive
impairment and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. Subcortical and periventricular white
matter damage is a major cause of age-related cognitive impairment, but the mechanisms remain
elusive. Located at the borderzone between separate arterial territories, the deep white matter is
highly vulnerable to hypoxia-ischemia. ApoE4 carriers have reduced cerebral blood flow, whereas
mice expressing human ApoE4 exhibit a profound disruption of key mechanisms regulating the
delivery of blood flow to the brain. These findings raise the possibility that such cerebrovascular
dysregulation renders the deep white matter more susceptible to hypoxia-ischemia. Perivascular
macrophages (PVM), brain resident myeloid cells closely apposed to the outer wall of cerebral
pial and penetrating vessels, can produce ApoE, are enriched in ApoE receptors, and are a
powerful source of vascular oxidative stress and inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesize that
PVM-derived ApoE4 acts in an autocrine manner on PVM to produce vascular oxidative stress
and inflammation, leading to neurovascular dysfunction and increased susceptibility to white
matter injury. Since NOX2 is the main source of reactive oxygen species in macrophages and
TRPM2 channels are critical for macrophage activation and neurovascular dysfunction, we will
also examine their role. We will test the following hypotheses: (a) PVM are both a source and
target of the ApoE4 mediating neurovascular dysfunction; (b) PVM TRPM2 channels and NOX2
mediate ApoE4-induced vascular oxidative stress and inflammation leading to neurovascular
dysfunction; (c) PVM-derived ApoE4 is responsible for the increased susceptibility to oligemic
WM damage through NOX2 and TRPM2 channels. Studies are conducted in young and old mice
of both sexes with targeted replacement of mouse ApoE with human ApoE3 or 4. Deep white
matter injury is produced in the corpus callosum by bilateral carotid artery stenosis using
microcoils. Cutting-edge approaches are used, including 3-photon excited fluorescence to image
the deep white matter and a novel mouse model enabling conditional gene targeting in PVM.
These approaches allow us to assess microvascular perfusion and damage in the deep white
matter in mice with ApoE4, NOX2, or TRPM2 deletion in PVM. These studies will provide insight
into the mechanisms underlying the impact of ApoE4 on white matter damage and may unveil
new therapeutic targets for one of the leading causes of cognitive impairment and dementia."

 As many as 92% percent of persons diagnosed with ALS develop swallowing impairments
over the course of the disease, which have been linked to aspiration pneumonia and
malnutrition and have been found to have negative prognostic effects on survival. As a result of
these swallowing impairments, patients are faced with the decision of whether to have a feeding
tube placed or not. For patients diagnosed with ALS and their healthcare providers, decision
making surrounding feeding tube placement has long been a significant challenge for a variety
of reasons including the wide heterogeneity and unpredictability in the timing of the onset and
progression of dysphagia and a lack of understanding of patients’ goals and concerns about
tradeoffs, benefits, and risks of management strategies. Endorsed by the National Institute of
Medicine as a way to improve health care quality, shared decision-making encourages patients
to actively weigh the risks and benefits of a treatment and match them to their personal
preferences. Shared-decision making tools (i.e. decision aids) have been found to increase
patient knowledge about a decision, decrease decisional conflict, positively affect patient-
clinician communication, and increase patient satisfaction with important decisions in many
areas of clinical medicine.8 The primary objective of the proposed study is to develop and test a
decision aid that improves patients’ knowledge about the decision, addresses patient and
caregivers’ goals and concerns surrounding the decision, and improves patient and physician
communication throughout the decision-making process. In aim 1, we will determine patient and
caregiver goals and concerns surrounding feeding tube placement using both qualitative and
survey-based research methods. In specific aims 2 and 3, we will use user-centered and
participatory research strategies to develop and test the feasibility, acceptability, and potential
effectiveness of a personalized decision aid prototype for feeding tube placement decision-
making in patients diagnosed with ALS. These aims are closely matched with a curated set of
training goals and a highly interdisciplinary set of mentors to provide the primary investigator
with the skills needed to successfully transition to research independence upon completion of
the work."

Individuals born prematurely are at increased risk for many chronic conditions, and respiratory disease
represents a significant portion of the morbidity and mortality in this population. Better understanding of the
etiology of chronic respiratory disease among those born preterm has the potential to improve diagnosis,
treatment, and prevention. Asthma occurs more frequently and severely among those born preterm. The etiology
of asthma is known to be multifactorial, involving innate inflammatory tendencies, potentiated by prenatal and
early life exposures. Asthma exhibits differences in presentation, and pathophysiology, based on biologic sex, a
phenomenon known as sexual dimorphism.
 Epigenetics represents a powerful tool for understanding early-life origins of chronic disease. Research
from our group in the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn (ELGAN) cohort has illustrated the critical role of
epigenetic and gene expression changes in the placenta as they relate to later development of a host of chronic
conditions.
 As a temporary organ during gestation, the placenta forms a barrier between the developing fetus, the
mother, and by extension, the outside world. It is a critical conduit through which the effects of environmental
exposures are filtered. The placenta also plays critical roles in directing fetal growth and development, and
establishing the neonatal immune system, while also protecting the fetus from rejection by the maternal immune
response. The placenta is also highly sexually dimorphic, responding differently to prenatal exposures, and
conferring risk differently for chronic disease, based on the biologic sex of the infant.
 Prior work from other groups has shown epigenetic changes in immune-related genes from cord blood
cells in association with the later development of childhood asthma among children born at term. Preliminary
analyses from EGLAN have shown differential epigenetic changes to immune-related genes in the placenta that
are associated with asthma development in a largely sex-dependent manner. No other published studies have
examined placental epigenetic factors as antecedents of asthma.
 We propose to further examine placental epigenetic mechanism and gene expression and their
association with development of asthma at age 10 years. Our study would be the first to provide a comprehensive
examination of epigenetic mechanisms and gene expression in the placenta, as well as epigenetic changes in
neonatal blood on day of life 1 as they relate to later development of asthma among ELGANs. The examination
of the role of differences based on biologic sex is also novel. These investigations will elucidate important general
and sex-specific genetic pathways that form the basis of the developmental origins of asthma. Enhanced
understanding of these will allow for improved diagnosis, treatment, and perhaps even prevention of asthma in
a particularly vulnerable population."
10913621,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite the hostile environment of the bloodstream where the host immune system is highly active, schistosomes,
parasitic flatworms that cause schistosomiasis that affects over 200 million individuals globally, have a
remarkable ability to thrive inside the vasculature for over several decades. While the tegument (outer skin) has
been shown to play an important role in parasite immune evasion, what remains a mystery is the mechanism by
which parasites neutralize large amounts of immune components that they ingest from the host blood. Our
recently published work reveals that the esophageal gland, an anterior accessory organ of parasite’s digestive
tract, is essential for schistosomes to survive inside the bloodstream. It operates by lysing ingested immune cells
before passing them into the gut, preventing them from accessing the inner parasite tissues. Such observations
lead us to hypothesize that specific esophageal gland proteins block and/or degrade host immune components,
thereby ensuring parasite survival. The main questions that we are interested in are: What are the roles of
esophageal gland factors in degrading and/or blocking host immune components and how do such functions
contribute to parasite survival? What is the mechanism of specific esophageal gland factors in parasite immune
evasion? These will be investigated under three specific aims: 1) Define the esophageal gland cell types and
genes; 2) Determine the role of specific esophageal gland factors in immune cell lysis and parasite survival; and
3) Determine the mechanism of specific esophageal gland factors in host-parasite interaction. In the first aim,
we will systematically identify esophageal gland genes by comparing RNA-seq data between parasites with and
without the esophageal gland tissue. In the second aim, we will functionally interrogate identified genes using
RNAi coupled with an in vitro feeding assay, and determine the viability of candidate gene-deficient parasites
inside the mammalian host. Preliminary results from these aims reveal dozens of esophageal gland factors, two
of which appear to be essential for degrading host immune cells. Thus, in the third aim, we will determine the
activity of the two candidate proteins, identify their binding partners, and decipher the mechanism of host-parasite
interaction. Together, we expect to bring new insights to schistosomes’ esophageal gland-mediated immune
evasion mechanism by identifying essential esophageal gland factors and their mode of action. The proposed
study is innovative since our findings will likely shift the paradigm of schistosome immune evasion, which has
been thought to be driven primarily by its tegument. Our study is significant since it bridges parasite
developmental and translational biology by identifying essential esophageal gland molecules and understanding
how they operate. These candidates may be exploited in the future as potential therapeutic targets that can
complement praziquantel in its limitations and collectively contribute to the fight against schistosomiasis."

Cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) are the leading causes of death worldwide. In this application we explore the
genomic risk for common CMD, including type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and
dyslipidemia, across non-European ancestry populations. Recent studies have shown that these complex human
traits are genetically correlated by pleiotropy, which occurs when a genetic locus affects more than one trait and
is a possible underlying cause for observed cross-phenotype associations. Relative to pleiotropy, polygenic risk
scores (PRS) which are estimated by combining GWAS-associated variants into a composite score, may better
explain the correlation between complex traits, by determining a subset of risk variants for each outcome.
However, PRS translate poorly when the discovery and target populations have differential ancestry. Combining
pleiotropy and PRS has great potential to uncover novel risk variants associated with CMD. We leverage the
large dataset in the All of Us research program and the NIH-funded CARdiometabolic Disorders IN African-
ancestry PopuLations (CARDINAL) study site, to identify pleiotropic variants and develop PRS for type 2
diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, in populations of diverse ancestry. The All of
Us dataset is ideal for generating novel biologic insights into complex disease etiology, with applications in global
populations."

Title: Microglia antigen presentation in the CNS of Alzheimer's disease
Project Summary/Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive
decline and dementia. Genome-wide association studies have identified novel AD susceptibility loci.
Interestingly the associated genes at several of these loci implicate the immune system in late-onset AD
(LOAD), specifically the innate immune system, including the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region. The
finding of the HLA region being genetically associated with LOAD further emphasizes the question of how
microglia, the antigen-presenting cells of the central nervous system (CNS), interact with infiltrating T cells,
which have been observed in the hippocampus of AD patients, and specifically what antigens are being
presented. In parallel, the pathogen hypothesis has garnered more support for a possible pathogenic etiology
of AD. We propose to leverage our understanding of the immune system combined with cutting-edge
technology and access to AD patient blood and brain autopsies to determine if these neuroinvasive pathogens
are neurovirulent in AD. For this application, we propose a multifaceted approach to: 1) identify the peptides
being presented by the MHC of microglia in the AD brain in regions of high T cell infiltration and areas of low T
cell infiltration; 2) examine the antigen reactivity and phenotype of T cells infiltrating the hippocampus in AD,
and 3) determine how microglia function as antigen-presenting cells of pathogens to infiltrating T cells."

Advancement of health equity requires evidence and tools tailored for minority groups. The shift towards
individualized precision medicine requires risk prediction tools to guide prevention and intervention. Due to the
genetic heterogeneity and social economic disparity, risk factors may disproportionately impact race/ethnicity
(R/E) groups. Overall risk prediction constructed from predominantly white populations can perform poorly on
other ethnic groups, leading to mis-diagnosis, over-treatment and other adverse health consequences. Efforts
on developing R/E-specific risk prediction at local healthcare systems are limited by the small sample size
caused by inadequate representability of minority populations. To address the gap and to advance precision
medicine for non-white patients, it is crucial to harness minority enriched clinical data and develop risk models
transferable to point of care. The All of Us (AoU) program offers a wealth of comprehensive multi-modal data
on whole genome sequencing (WGS), real-world electronic health records (EHR) and patient reported
outcomes (PRO) with enhanced minority participation, providing the common evidence base for learning
general R/E-specific risk patterns and training risk models for minority populations at local healthcare systems.
In this proposal, we develop innovative methods for risk modeling in AoU data tailored for minority populations
and its validation on external healthcare data. We will showcase the proposed methods in two use cases: 1)
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) genome-wide association study (GWAS) at Mass General Brigham (MGB) focusing
on the genetic risk factors; 2) cancer cardiotoxicity prediction study at M Health Fairview (MHF) focusing on
clinical and social determinants of health (SDoH) risk factors. In Aim 1, we integrate risk factor and disease
onset outcome data across WGS, EHR and PRO in AoU data to construct the risk prediction model that yields
better risk prediction accuracy, risk factor identification and fairness across R/E groups. In Aim 2, we design
privacy preserving algorithms to validate the generalizability risk modeling from AoU data on external
healthcare data and establish the transfer learning strategy to adapt AoU risk models for local healthcare
systems. We intend for the methods to facilitate development of risk modeling using AoU data with focus on
minority populations, as well as toe demonstrate the potential impact of the AoU program on improving care at
local healthcare."

Precision identification of alcohol use disorder (AUD) is an urgent but unmet clinical need. Timely identifying
AUD remains challenging, with only 1 in 6 binge drinkers is screened for AUD. AUD in individuals with lower
socioeconomic status are less likely to be diagnosed and treated timely due to the fear of stigmatization. They
also suffer higher risk of death and other health and social consequences. The All of Us (AoU) research
dataset holds the promise for computationally identifying undiagnosed AUD cases at clinical settings. The AoU
dataset covers longitudinal electronic medical records (EMR), the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-
Consumption (AUDIT-C) screening results which is one of the gold standards for AUD diagnosis, the genomics
data that explains the heritable factors, and the rich SDoH and lifestyle surveys for the environmental
exposures. However, the unique and complex AoU data domains and data patterns challenge current
statistical and machine learning models. To address these challenges, we propose to develop the Graph
Artificial Intelligence for Precision identification of Alcohol use disorder (GAIPA), an evidence-driven, graph-
based clinical informatics approach to transfer the knowledge learned from the AoU data to identify
undiagnosed AUD cases in clinical care. We propose to: Aim 1. Establish an AUD classification model
using graph artificial intelligence model, the AoU multi-modality data, and the Indiana Network for Patient Care
(INPC) EMR data. Specifically, we will: Aim 1.1: Build the generic model through weak supervision using AoU
AUDIT-C survey and AUD diagnosis as weak ground truth; and Aim 1.2: Build hospital-specific AUD
classification models through style transfer learning using INPC EMR data. Specific models will be built for
Indiana University Health (IUH) and Eskenazi Health (EH). Aim 2. Validate the performance of the hospital-
specific AUD classification models through clinical surveys. Current IUH and EH patients will be screened
using corresponding hospital-specific AUD classification models using INPC EMR data. According to the model
predictions, 200 patients who do not have AUD diagnosis (50% predicted as AUD positive and 50% as AUD
negative) will be tested using AUIDT. The success of the proposed GAIPA model will provide a transferrable

The overall goal of this Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) is to strengthen pediatric health
care research infrastructure in Delaware, specifically that at the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children. Consistent
with this goal, we will establish a thematic, multidisciplinary health research system – The REACH (Research
Expanding Access to Child Health) Center – rooted in the principles and methods of pediatric healthcare delivery
science, bridging our biomedical research and health care systems, and focused on ensuring equitable access
to high quality pediatric health care for all. The mission of the Administrative Core is to coordinate the people
and processes needed to establish REACH as a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence, implement the
Center’s plans, and ensure achievement of the Overall Specific Aims. The REACH Center Administrative Core
aligns all elements for accomplishing the Overall Aims of the Center. The Administrative Core has prioritized five
key functions: 1) stewardship; 2) creation of resources; 3) allocation of funds and resources; 4) production,
synthesis, and utilization of research; and, 5) accountability and sustainability. These functions will be
accomplished through the purposeful implementation of three Programs (Project Funding, Mentorship, and
Research Management) and the coordination and integration of two REACH Center Research Cores –
PROMISE (Pediatric Research Optimizing Methods in Stakeholder Engagement) and IMPACT (Intervention
Methods: Provision and Connection through Technology) – with existing Delaware IDeA state network resources.
With an exceptional project team and sound governance plan, the Administrative Core will: 1) create a cohesive
sustainable infrastructure to expand capacity for innovative stakeholder-engaged research programs developing
and evaluating technology-enabled interventions to address inequities in child health; 2) coordinate educational
and administrative resources to establish a critical mass of independent multidisciplinary investigators committed
to research addressing issues of equity in pediatric healthcare; and, 3) ensure successful day-to-day operations
and long-term success of the REACH Center. The Administrative Core will provide an integrated network of core
resources, project funding, a robust mentoring program, and expert research operations and administrative
oversight to build biomedical research excellence in Delaware focused on expanding access to high quality
pediatric health care and health for all children in Delaware with broad national implications."

10802346,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Interventions designed to improve pediatric health are often stymied by factors such as lengthy research-to-
practice gaps, limited effectiveness, and poor uptake by those they are intended to serve. Newer models of
healthcare, which are transforming “top down” hierarchical systems into models of true partnership among
patients, families, and healthcare providers, offer new opportunities to overcome these challenges. To
accommodate newer models of care and to address the systematic healthcare inequities that have lifelong
consequences for children, the next generation of healthcare researchers must be equipped to conduct
intervention research that reduces disparities, utilizes cutting edge methodological and technological
approaches, and allows for rapid implementation of effective interventions. Strategies that focus on direct
partnership with target populations at all levels of intervention development, delivery, and dissemination hold
great promise to transform pediatric healthcare. Integrating technology at all stages of intervention research is
also a critical and important strategy to mitigate challenges. The proposed Intervention Methodology: Provision
and Connection through Technology (IMPACT) Core has two inter-related components, one dedicated to
intervention development, delivery, and implementation (Intervention Science); the second focused on the
technological expertise and tools needed to create and sustain interventions (Technological Applications). With
this focus, IMPACT will support the development and delivery of user-centered, stakeholder-engaged,
technology-enabled interventions to promote health and well-being for pediatric populations experiencing health
disparities and social inequities. The IMPACT core will provide resources including expertise, tools, training, and
technical assistance to investigators developing and conducting programs of technology-enhanced intervention
research to reduce disparities and improve the health and wellbeing of children and families across Delaware.
The IMPACT Core will accomplish this goal by: (1) creating a robust infrastructure to facilitate the development,
delivery and implementation of scalable, innovative, technology-enhanced interventions primed for delivery to
patients and families impacted by health disparities and social inequities, (2) preparing and supporting
investigators in the conduct of intervention research using technology to address equity in pediatric health care,
and (3) creating procedures and processes to manage and sustain the IMPACT Core. The Core Director, Dr.
Kimberly Canter, will be supported by a team of content experts, an internal advisory committee, and Career
Consultants who will provide mentorship at the mid-career level. The goals of the IMPACT Core directly support
the overall aims of the REACH Center to develop, evaluate, and implement innovative technology-enhanced
interventions and models of care to overcome the complex socio-ecological factors responsible for inadequate
access to health care and child health."
10802348,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Pediatric Research Optimizing Methods In Stakeholder Engagement (PROMISE) Core will support
Research Expanding Access to Child Health (REACH) COBRE investigations by fostering engagement of
communities and investigators as equal co-participants throughout the research process. Communities are
powerful and essential partners in the effective, comprehensive, and equitable transformation of pediatric care.
Community stakeholders possess a valuable and often rich appreciation of the multilevel, complex social realities
that contribute to disparities in health and health care for children and families. Community-engaged research
holds the potential to address disparities in health and health care, yet few investigators pursue partnerships and
community participation because of a lack of training and perceived barriers including the time commitment and
difficulty generating empirical publications from such research. The PROMISE Core will support investigators in
taking a community-based, participatory approach in their research and address the barriers that dissuade
investigators, especially early career investigators, from engaging in this approach. Specifically, the PROMISE
Core will establish an institutional infrastructure that prepares investigators by: a) training them in community-
engaged research frameworks, b) forming and facilitating ongoing project work groups for specific investigators
and relevant community stakeholders, c) providing ongoing technical assistance/consultation, and d) maintaining
a data repository to support investigators in expediently generating rigorous evidence in response to community-
priority questions. This institutional infrastructure will apply a framework for the successful engagement of
community stakeholders and investigators in a process of equal participation in all aspects of the research
process, including co-construction, co-execution, and shared interpretation and dissemination of findings. The
PROMISE Core aims to: 1) create a dynamic, responsive infrastructure to support investigators in their pursuit
of conducting stakeholder-engaged intervention-focused research to address pediatric health disparities, 2)
prepare and support investigators in participating in stakeholder-engaged research and producing, translating,
and utilizing scientific knowledge to improve community health, and (3) manage and sustain these resources to
broadly support community-engaged research to address health disparities. Dr. J. J. Cutuli will direct the
PROMISE Core, supported by a core Internal Advisory Committee, the REACH Stakeholder Advisory Committee
and the existing Delaware Clinical and Translational Research ACCEL Program Community Engagement and
Outreach Core Community Advisory Council. The PROMISE Core will bring community expertise to bear on
questions of inequity in pediatric health and health care, enabling the REACH Center to achieve its overall goals
of developing, evaluating, and implementing new interventions and models of care to overcome the complex
socioecological factors that contribute to health inequity."
10802350,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly 1 in 5 children in the United States are affected by obesity, with even higher rates among children of racial
and ethnic minority groups, of low socioeconomic status, and living in rural communities. Obesity is a significant
public health concern because it increases a child’s risk for health conditions within every organ system, including
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and mental health problems. Traditional lifestyle behavior interventions have
not been as effective when implemented in communities of color, low-income communities, and rural
communities. Guided by the Clinical and Community Integration Framework, which emphasizes the integration
of community and healthcare systems to drive family engagement and empowerment in treating obesity, our
work has demonstrated the importance of addressing psychosocial needs and leveraging technology to improve
care for families of children with obesity. We have assembled a research team, with complimentary and relevant
areas of expertise, to refine and test a multi-component intervention, Mobile Integrated Care for Childhood
Obesity (MICCO). MICCO combines evidence-based approaches previously developed and tested by our
research team, each delivered through a mobile app platform integrated with the electronic health record.
Components will include: (1) coordinating social services in the community to meet families’ psychosocial needs,
(2) integrating care from obesity specialists using telehealth, and (3) providing media-based psychoeducational
tools to promote self-management of lifestyle behavior change. Community-engaged and qualitative research
methods will be employed to refine MICCO to be community-centered and family-friendly (Aim 1). The refined
intervention will be tested in a randomized controlled trial with 184 families of children 4-12 years of age with
obesity, recruited from rural primary care practices, to determine the impact of the intervention on child adiposity
and family engagement in treatment over six months (Aim 2) and disparities in these outcomes by race, ethnicity,
and socioeconomic status (Aim 3). This study will inform a R01 application in Year 2 to expand the concept to a
multi-site RCT to test the effectiveness of MICCO’s integrated, community-centered, and technologically state-
of-the-art approach in improving the reach and relevance of childhood obesity treatments to families in
underserved rural communities, increasing the likelihood of a positive impact on obesity outcomes and inequities
in child health."
10802351,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect. CHD affects all racial, ethnic, and
socioeconomic groups, yet underserved populations (e.g., low-income Black and Hispanic patients) are
disproportionally affected by disease-related morbidities. They are more likely to be delivered preterm, to be
readmitted to the hospital after surgery, to exhibit developmental delays, and ultimately, to die from CHD. CHD
is increasingly diagnosed prenatally across racial/ethnic groups. While prenatal diagnosis can be beneficial for
the infant in that it facilitates medical care immediately following birth, mothers describe their prenatal
experiences as highly stressful and traumatic. Maternal stress during pregnancy exerts a powerful influence on
birth outcomes and developmental trajectories, particularly for children in underserved populations. Targeted
efforts to mitigate impacts of maternal stress for this highly vulnerable population are lacking. In partnership with
diverse parent and clinician stakeholders, our team designed HeartPREP, an innovative, virtually-delivered
psychosocial intervention for mothers expecting a baby with CHD. HeartPREP will be delivered in English and
Spanish through the Nemours App, an accessible tool for telehealth, education, and communication with
clinicians. The proposed study will evaluate whether HeartPREP improves maternal and family outcomes
following prenatal diagnosis of CHD. Participants across all study aims will be diverse expectant mothers carrying
a fetus identified as having CHD, recruited from two hospitals within the Nemours Children’s Health System. We
have assembled a team of experts in family-based psychosocial intervention and patient-centered outcomes
research to (Aim 1) refine HeartPREP through Think Aloud Testing with 15-20 expectant mothers and evaluate
initial feasibility, usability, and acceptability through beta testing with 10 expectant mothers, (Aim 2) determine
whether HeartPREP modules produce clinically significant improvements on outcomes (emotional distress,
social isolation, parenting self-efficacy, and hope; measured by PROMIS) in 20 expectant mothers (Proof-of-
Concept), and (Aim 3) evaluate the impact of HeartPREP compared to standard care control (SCC). Sixty
expectant mothers carrying a fetus identified as having CHD will be randomized to HeartPREP or SCC and will
complete assessment of outcomes weekly during intervention (emotional distress, social isolation, parenting
self-efficacy, and hope) and at post-intervention and 3-month postnatal follow-up (anxiety, depression, traumatic
stress, and couple/family functioning). An R01 application planned for Year 2 would fund expansion of Aim 3 into
a multi-site efficacy trial. HeartPREP has the potential to improve the emotional wellbeing of mothers expecting
a baby with CHD, thereby altering developmental trajectories for this large population of children. This model
can then be adapted for other birth defects (3% of all births), given commonalities in maternal stress reactions,
broadly addressing the disproportionate burden of disease-related morbidities in underserved populations."
10802424,"The prevalence rates for children’s mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders, as well as for childhood
obesity, are at alarmingly high levels and need to be systematically addressed through effective prevention
strategies. Early-stage scientists in the Research Center for Child Well-Being are conducting intensive
prevention trials that are supported in part by the Center’s Clinical Trials Logistics Core research facility (CTL
Core). The CTL Core seeks to bolster the scientific rigor and transparency of the Center’s preventive
intervention clinical trials, which involve the prospective assignment of human participants to an intervention
and evaluate behavioral and health-related outcomes. The CTL Core is essential to ensure compliance with
NIH’s most recent Clinical Trials Policies. Early-stage investigators, central to the Center’s mission and goals,
do not yet have the experience and infrastructure support to incorporate the newest Clinical Trial requirements
into the conceptualization, conduct, and reporting of their intervention trials. The evaluation of interventions for
the prevention and reduction of mental, emotional, behavioral, and unhealthy lifestyle-related risk factors in
childhood requires substantial support and guidance with respect to preparatory steps, community and school
engagement, trial reporting demands, state-of-the-art measurement of primary and secondary outcomes, and
focused evaluation of intervention implementation processes. The CTL Core provides the requisite
infrastructure, instrumentation, and technical expertise to support the prevention trials and related studies
conducted by the early-stage investigators to rigorously implement interventions within real-world settings. The
CTL Core draws on the Center’s local Community Advisory Board and experienced staff to promote effective
community and school engagement. Overall, the CTL Core enhances the integrity of the independent and
dependent variables measured in Center sponsored research by ensuring: state-of-the-art measures; well-
specified and deployed intervention and measurement protocols; and diligent attention to human subjects’
protocols and issues. The CTL Core aims include: AIM 1: Deploy a cogent team to provide technical expertise
and state-of-the-art instrumentation to the Center’s early-stage investigators to conduct high-quality prevention
trials; AIM 2: Provide support and guidance for: (a) the research projects led by Center early-stage
investigators with respect to the preparation, conduct, and reporting of their prevention trials; (b) pilot seed
projects; and, (c) the preparation of R01-level research projects by transitioning early-stage investigators; and
AIM 3: Conduct technical training workshops for early-stage investigators, faculty, and staff in the Center, and
other university faculty who conduct prevention trials involving children, on (1) community participation and
engagement; and (2) requirements, compliance, and best practices for clinical trials. The CTL Core provides
critical support to move investigators to independent researcher status."
10802426,"The Research Center for Child Well-Being focuses on prevention and intervention research aimed at reducing 
risk for mental, emotional, and behavioral problems and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors in children ages 2-10. 
Preventive intervention outcome trials constitute a major portion of the Center’s research activities. A critical 
component of the Center is the Statistical and Data Management Core facility (SDM Core), which supports the 
Center’s research efforts and especially the early-stage investigators. Preventive intervention outcome studies, 
which are generally field-based rather than delivered in a laboratory or hospital setting, make substantial 
demands on the resources and capacities directly available to individual investigators. For the Center’s early- 
stage investigators in particular, the provision of data management and statistical analytic services by the SDM 
Core is essential in making prevention studies feasible, so that the investigators can focus all of their project 
resources exclusively on recruitment, intervention implementation, and data collection. The SDM Core is 
structured and staffed to address the many issues arising in preventive intervention outcome studies, such as 
power concerns, multi-level designs, moderation and mediation analyses, missing data issues, complier 
average causal effect to address differences in intervention adherence. The Center investigators, as well as 
other prevention researchers at the institution, benefit substantially from the experienced statistical and other 
technical personnel comprising the SDM Core. The specific aims for the SDM Core are: (1) To establish the 
facilities and assemble the technical and scientific personnel necessary for high-quality statistical and data- 
management services pertinent to the early-stage investigators’ conduct of preventive intervention clinical trials 
and related studies; (2) To support research projects led by the Center’s early-stage investigators, which 
involves provision of: (a) consultation for design and analytic planning, (b) data management services, (c) 
statistical programming and analysis, and (d) assistance in interpretation of analyses; (3) To provide workshop 
training and updates on prevention-related developments in methodology and statistics to enable Center early- 
career and senior scientists, as well as other prevention scientists on campus, to better understand new or 
complex methods; (4) To advance ways to optimize methods and applications in statistical analyses and 
programming, in the context of the Center’s prevention research. SDM Core support helps to enable the 
Center’s mission by: (a) contributing to the scientific environment conducive to early-stage investigators 
moving to independent research status; (b) utilizing, and keeping investigators abreast of, methodological 
advances pertinent to preventive intervention trials; and, (c) strengthening the institution’s capacity to meet the 
data-management and statistical requirements of high-quality preventive intervention trials conducted by the 
early-stage investigators in particular."
10809401,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bone disorders such as osteomyelitis that result from bacterial infection are associated
with severe inflammation and progressive bone loss. Staphylococcus aureus is the most
common causative agent of osteomyelitis and the incidence and severity of
staphylococcal osteomyelitis appears to be increasing despite improvements in
prophylaxis and diagnosis. Dysregulation of osteoclast formation and activity results in
bone destruction and/or abnormal bone remodeling at sites of infection, and osteoblasts
play an essential role in the regulation of these bone-resorbing cells. In addition,
bacterially infected osteoblasts and osteoclasts are capable of producing an array of
immune mediators that could promote the recruitment and activation of inflammatory
leukocytes in bone tissue. While type I interferons, such as IFN-a and IFN-b, are best
known for their antiviral effects, it is becoming increasingly apparent that they can
impact susceptibility to bacterial pathogens including S. aureus. Furthermore, IFN-a and
IFN-b have been shown to affect bone homeostasis and are potent inhibitors of
osteoclastogenesis. We have intriguing preliminary data indicating that osteoblasts
express IFN-b, select IFN-stimulated genes, and key intracellular mediators of interferon
effects, in response to S. aureus infection. In this R03 pilot project, we will begin to test
the hypothesis that S. aureus infected bone cells are a significant source of type I
interferons and that such production serves to limit the intracellular bacterial burden and/
or pro-osteoclastogenic responses associated with conditions such as osteomyelitis. We
will characterize the type I interferon responses of isolated bone cells to S. aureus
infection and perform an initial determination of the effects of IFN-a and IFN-b on
bacterial burden and bone cell formation and function in S. aureus-infected osteoblasts
and osteoclasts. These studies will provide critical preliminary data for future studies to
fully define the role played by type I interferons in such infections for which R01
mechanism support will be sought."
10809412,"Project Summary
Recent clinical trials of platelet-inhibiting medications for preventing a second stroke following an initial minor
stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) have shown that recurrences of strokes over time follow a distinct time
course, with a high rate of recurrence over the first few days, slowing to a steady lower rate over subsequent
months. We have shown that this temporal course can be predicted from a model of stroke recurrence risk
based on kinetic analysis, in which rates of events are proportional to numbers of subjects in a given state
multiplied by a fixed kinetic rate for that state. A kinetic model that postulates both a transient vulnerable state
and a stabilized state following initial ischemic events predicts a specific mathematical form for the time course
of the event-free survival curve (the proportion of subjects not yet having experienced a recurrence, over time).
The predictions of this model closely match the data from the POINT, SOCRATES, and THALES trials, and
allow for estimation of the kinetic rate constants that describe the rate of ischemic stroke recurrence in the
vulnerable state (k1), the rate in the stabilized state (k2), and also the rate of transition from the vulnerable to
stabilized state (k0).These different rates that determine risks of stroke recurrence are likely to relate to
different underlying biological mechanisms, and to be distinct in their responses to different treatments. In fact,
we have shown that the added anti-platelet medication strategies used in these trials only affected only k1, not
the other rates.
Understanding the condition of patients following stroke in these kinetic terms of distinct vulnerable and
stabilized states, subject to different biologically-determined rates of stroke recurrence, allows for exploring
what patient risk factors or treatments may selectively affect the different rates. These insights have
implications for how clinical trials of treatments should be designed. For instance, if a certain type of treatment
only affects k1, the rate of stroke recurrence in the transient vulnerable state, then it is only likely to make an
impact when applied rapidly and for the short-term following the initial stroke. In contrast, interventions
affecting the recurrence rate in the stabilized state will need to be applied for longer periods to impact overall
stroke recurrence. Determining the distinct effects of risk factors or treatments on the individual rate constants
requires data from large numbers of patients to quantify the effects. By combining the data from the large
SOCRATES, POINT, and THALES trials into a unified and harmonized data set, these types of careful
analyses can be performed, testing important questions as to which kinetic rates are specifically affected by
patient risk characteristics, by treatments such as cholesterol-lowering medicines or anti-inflammatory
medicines, or by the presence of significant plaque and stenosis in intracranial arteries. These important
insights, with implications for the design of future clinical trials, are the goal of this project."
10811777,"Many URM students are hesitant to apply to PhD programs. However, when they do apply to doctoral programs at
the UofSC, we find that URM students usually do as well as their non-URM counterparts even though their
credentials may be less competitive.
 Reasons for the low number of URM students who apply to and enter doctoral programs include:
 • Perceived poor qualifications, particularly as a result of poverty and resulting poor education (2) and the
 perception, often accurate, that the student’s qualifications such as GPA or GRE score are inadequate.
 • Little research experience, especially when the student has attended a small undergraduate school rather
 than a major research university.
 • Little information about biomedical research careers and the financial support available to pursue a doctorate.
 • Family financial considerations, something that is a major problem in regions with a high URM population.
UofSC PREP addresses these issues. Each year we will admit eight Scholars from under-represented backgrounds
who will be hired as full-time temporary research employees. The Scholars will work full time in a research laboratory
and will take one graduate course per semester. After completing a summer and a fall graduate course, the PREP
Scholars will have a graduate transcript with a good GPA so that they can gain acceptance into graduate PhD
programs even though they might have a marginal undergraduate GPA. In addition, they will have had the
opportunity to show that they can do research at a level that is typical of a beginning graduate student. Our previous

11041931,"BACKGROUND and INTRODUCTION The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) provides clinical trial sites to the International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Group (IMPAACT). The IMPAACT network and its leadership group are in charge of the creation of all their studies, protocols, and clinical trials. These activities are funded through Grants/Cooperative agreements sponsored by NIAID. The IMPAACT Network is a cooperative group of institutions, investigators, and other collaborators mainly focused on evaluating potential therapies for HIV infection and its related symptoms and co-infections in infants, children, adolescents and pregnant women. This includes clinical trials of HIV/AIDS interventions for the prevention of mother to child transmission. In 1990 the NICHD began collaborating with the PACTG to expand clinical trial availability at NICHD clinical trial centers/sites. This collaboration made possible to conduct clinical trials by the IMPAACT Network to further evaluate antiretroviral therapeutic agents, other therapies targeted at opportunistic infections, and interventions to prevent perinatal HIV transmission. In recent years, the collaboration is expanding to evaluate potential HIV cure approaches and vaccines. 

SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES This task order is to provide Core infrastructure support at the clinical sites comprising the NICHD multi-site network of domestic and international clinical centers conducting IMPAACT Network protocols. Core infrastructure includes routine tasks for maintaining site readiness to conduct clinical trials for evaluation of investigational therapies, diagnostic techniques, prevention strategies, epidemiology and natural history of multiple aspects of HIV infection in pediatric, adolescent, and maternal patient populations."

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection remains incurable, with over 38 million people affected
worldwide. While HIV-1 is known to enter the brain within the first two weeks of infection, it is estimated that 20-
50% of people with HIV-1 will develop HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Neuroinflammation is
thought to play a key role in HIV-1 persistence, and substance use disorders, including smoking, may further
contribute to inflammation and cognitive decline. In this study, we aim to investigate the impact of nicotine, a key
component of tobacco smoking, on NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the central nervous system of people
with HIV-1 and substance use disorders. Our research addresses a critical gap in understanding how
inflammation contributes to HIV-1 persistence and cognitive decline in smokers with HIV-1. We will investigate
how HIV-1 infection and nicotine exposure interact to activate the inflammasome and increase inflammation in
human tonsil explants and iPSC-derived microglia to achieve our goals. We will use a newly developed xenograft
humanized mouse model to track inflammasome differential expression and activation in brain regions,
specifically in latent and productively infected and bystander cells. Finally, we will analyze post-mortem brain
samples from individuals with HIV-1 and compare the expression of markers associated with NLRP3
inflammasome activation in smokers versus non-smokers. The proposed research will provide crucial insights
into the mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation and cognitive decline in people with HIV-1 and substance
use disorders. Our work will elucidate the role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in HIV-1-associated
inflammation and identify potential therapeutic targets to address this issue. By advancing our understanding of
inflammation and the immune response to HIV-1 in smokers, we hope to develop novel treatments for this
population's cognitive decline and immune dysregulation."
10931639,"SUMMARY
Pharmacological inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling can efficiently reduce alcohol intake and
seeking in rodent and primate models of heavy alcohol drinking, as well as in human subjects with an alcohol
use disorder (AUD). Despite the wealth of evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of GR inhibition for the
treatment of AUD, the molecular mechanism mediating this effect remains unknown. Aside from acting as a
transcriptional regulator, GR can bind a subset of mRNAs in the cytoplasm and elicit their rapid degradation
upon ligand binding – a process called GR-mediated mRNA decay (GMD). Intriguingly, we demonstrated that
the endoribonuclease RIDA, a critical component of the GMD complex, is among the most significantly
upregulated proteins in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during abstinence following a history of
excessive alcohol drinking. The present project will test the hypothesis that hyperactive GMD contributes to
alcohol intake escalation and underlies the ability of GR antagonism to reduce alcohol drinking in mice withdrawn
from chronic intermittent alcohol vapor inhalation. A first aim will be to determine whether abstinence increases
GMD activity in excessive alcohol drinkers. To do so, we will first determine the identity of mRNAs bound to GR
in mPFC samples from alcohol-naïve mice and test whether GR activation causes their rapid degradation. We
will then examine the effect of alcohol withdrawal on these potential GMD substrates and the ability of GR
inhibition to prevent it. A second aim will be to determine whether blocking GMD in the mPFC via local RIDA
knockdown, which will not impact GR transcriptional activity, can replicate the effect of GR antagonism on
excessive alcohol consumption and cognitive impairment. Our approach capitalizes on our expertise in modeling
AUD in mice and manipulating gene expression in small brain regions, combined with access to state-of-the-art
core resources for RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. The proposed work will enhance our
understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving alcohol intake escalation and memory deficits in mice, as
well as the mechanism of action of GR antagonists. It will probe for the first time the relevance of GMD in the
brain and may identify a new molecular target for the treatment of AUD and other GR-related neurological and
psychiatric disorders."
10811283,"Project Summary
Exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) is associated with inflammation due to an upregulation of inflammatory
mediators and hyperactivity of the cells responsible for their production. The key immune cells involved in IR-
induced inflammation, both as exacerbators and extinguishers, are macrophages (MΦ). Thus, deciphering of
the signaling mechanisms responsible for IR-induced activation and polarization of these highly radioresistant
cells is important for the identification of therapeutic targets to manage acute and counteract chronic IR-
related inflammation. Along with damage-associated molecular patterns, released from irradiated tissues,
radiation itself directly impacts MΦ through DNA damage and modulation of transcription that alters the MΦ
phenotype. This effect is implemented through the activation of specific DNA and RNA sensors and
downstream signaling pathways, resulting in differential expression of type I interferons (IFN-I) and interferon-
stimulated genes (ISGs). It is well established that DNA fragments activate the STING/TBK1 pathway,
thereby triggering IFN-I expression. However, we recently demonstrated that the cytoplasmic RNA sensors,
RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and their adaptor protein MAVS, also play a significant role in MΦ activation after
IR. We found that activation of the RLR family member MDA5 by double-stranded RNA, due IR-induced
transcription of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), leads to increased expression of IFN-I and inflammation-
related genes. This finding generates two important questions that need to be resolved. First, whether the
signaling from RLRs is critical for prolonged IR-induced activation of MΦ. Our data that ERV RNA-induced
MDA5 signaling and IFN-I expression, in turn, upregulates retroviral transcription, suggests that there is a
positive feedback loop for ERV expression that maintains recurrent activation of the RLR-MAVS pathway and
thereby inflammatory activation of MΦ. Thus, we propose a time-course study of the involvement of RLR-
MAVS signaling, IFN-I response and ERV transcription in the short- and long-term effects of gamma IR using
MΦ with knocked out MAVS or IFN-I receptor and in vivo using the wild-type C57BL/6J mice and a MAVS-
knockout strain. The second question is whether IR dose influences the impact of RNA sensors versus DNA
sensors, with respect to the IR-induced DNA damage. We found that increases in IR dose led to a decline in
RLR and MAVS levels, whereas the DNA sensing proteins were consistently upregulated. To test our
hypothesis that high IR doses result in DNA sensing pathway activation and a STING-mediated mechanism
of IFN-I expression that determines MΦ activation, we will investigate the dose-dependent disruption of RLR-
RNA complexes with MAVS, DNA damage and accumulation of DNA fragments and RNA:DNA duplexes to
assess their impact on RLR and STING-TBK1 signaling using MΦ cultures and the indicated above mouse
strains, along with STING-knockout mice. We expect to identify nucleic acid-related signaling mechanism(s)
responsible for the radiation-induced changes in MΦ polarity and their pathological inflammatory activation."

Latinos/as are a large and growing segment of the United States older adult population and are at increased
risk for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRDs) compared to non-Latino/a Whites. Evidence
suggests that Latinos/as are particularly susceptible to ADRD in the presence of cardiovascular disease risk
factors (CVDRFs). Several other factors (e.g., sex, acculturation, Alzheimer’s biomarkers) may influence the
degree to which CVDRFs are linked to ADRD risk. For example, our own preliminary data suggest that Latina
women with elevated CVDRFs are more likely to have mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an intermediate stage
between healthy cognition and ADRD, than men. Interestingly, less acculturation (i.e., maintaining Latino/a
culture and less adoption of Anglo-American culture) has been associated with better cardiovascular health,
particularly among women, but pilot data has linked lower acculturation to poorer cognition. Finally, Alzheimer’s
biomarkers are becoming more accessible but have not been thoroughly investigated among Latinos/as who
are more likely to have mixed Alzheimer’s and cerebrovascular pathology (brain damage linked to poor
cardiovascular health) as opposed to pure Alzheimer’s pathology. The overarching goal of the proposed study
is to develop a comprehensive characterization of cognitive impairment and ADRD risk among middle-age and
older Latinos/as. To achieve this, the proposed project will incorporate psychosocial (i.e., acculturation) and
biological [i.e., CVDRFs, small vessel disease (a marker of cerebrovasculature), and Alzheimer’s biomarkers]
factors to study longitudinal cognitive change among Latinos/as 50+ years old. More specifically, the proposed
project will examine detailed cognitive data from the Study of Latinos- Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging
(SOL-INCA), SOL-INCA MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and SOL-INCA AD (Alzheimer’s disease),
ancillary studies to the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). In aim 1 we seek to
characterize gender-specific associations between acculturation and MCI, and test if CVDRFs underly the link
between acculturation and MCI status in over 6,000 Latinos/as. In aim 2 we will use gender-specific analysis to
determine if small vessel disease accounts for the relationship between CVDRFs and MCI/dementia status
(while accounting for acculturation); projected n = 2,400. In aim 3, we will examine whether acculturation or
Alzheimer’s biomarkers influence the relationships between small vessel disease and MCI/dementia status;
projected n = 2,400. The proposed K08 project will provide the candidate the tools necessary to continue
investigating Latino/a cognitive aging and ADRD risk through the National Institute on Aging’s Health
Disparities Framework as an independent clinical scientist."

Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and long-term disability worldwide, and other than reperfusion
therapy, almost no treatment is available. Thus, there is an urgent need for new stroke therapies, particularly
those that demonstrate efficacy in the elderly, when most strokes occur. Mounting evidence indicates that
proteostasis-based therapeutics have great potential in treating aging- and/or ischemia-related diseases that are
characterized by a disrupted proteome. Especially, the unfolded protein response (UPR), which comprises
multiple adaptive response pathways that facilitate recovery of proteostasis, has been increasingly recognized
as a highly promising therapeutic target for neurodegenerative and ischemic diseases. The UPR is activated
when the proteome in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a key organelle for protein folding and maturation, is
perturbed, a condition called ER stress. The primary purpose of the UPR is to restore cellular proteostasis and
promote cell survival. The UPR has 3 major branches, named after 3 ER stress sensor proteins: ATF6 (activating
transcription factor 6), IRE1(inositol-requiring enzyme 1), and PERK (protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase). It is
well known that ischemic stroke causes ER stress and activates the UPR. Importantly, our extensive data have
established that activation of the UPR in neurons during the acute stroke phase is neuroprotective, strongly
endorsing the therapeutic potential of the UPR in ischemic stroke. But, to develop safe and effective UPR-based
pharmacologic interventions in stroke, we must further know 1) how the UPR affects other brain cell types,
especially astrocytes – the most abundant cell subtype in the brain, and 2) how UPR modulation impacts long-
term stroke outcome. Thus, the objectives of this renewal proposal are to determine the astrocytic role of the
individual UPR branches in stroke pathophysiology, and to assess the therapeutic potential of targeting the UPR
in stroke using young and aged animals. Our overarching hypothesis is that the individual UPR branches
influence stroke outcome in a cell- and phase-specific manner and thus, must be harnessed accordingly for
optimal UPR-based therapeutic strategies in stroke. Guided by our preliminary data, and also inspired by exciting
advances in the field, we will pursue 3 specific aims: 1) Determine the role of the ATF6 UPR branch in ischemic
stroke; 2) Determine the role of the IRE1/XBP1 UPR branch in ischemic stroke; 3) Determine the role of the
PERK UPR branch in ischemic stroke. The proposed research is significant because we expect to clarify the role
of each astrocytic UPR branch in stroke, and to determine the effects of pharmacologic modulation of the UPR
on stroke outcome in the context of stroke phase and aging. Such knowledge will be fundamental to informing
the development of new UPR-based strategies aimed to improve quality of life for stroke patients."

Primary care is essential to improving population health outcomes and reducing health disparities but struggles
to meet the burgeoning needs in the areas of chronic illness and prevention, mental health and addiction, and
social needs, and faces challenges in access, patient experience and staff shortages. Learning health systems
(LHS) hold promise for transforming primary care but the feasibility and impact of the LHS is uncertain in
community settings without embedded research expertise. For LHSs to make meaningful, equitable
improvements in care, they must reach systems serving individuals with low income and a disproportionate
burden of illness and disparities. The Washington LHS E-STAR Center will respond by building a consortium of
research organizations that are leaders in LHS training and research, and diverse primary care organizations
across the state, where diverse embedded LHS researchers receive training and mentorship. The E-STAR
Center is 2 premier research organizations, Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute and the
University of Washington and 6 primary care organizations (PCOs)—2 integrated systems and 4 Federally
Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). Our novel LHS model for primary care transformation builds on our
successful CATALyST LHS K12 training program, adding 3 innovations: increased participatory research,
formalized stakeholder engagement, and a health equity focus. Mentoring teams will include expertise in
community-based participatory research, and health equity in addition to expertise in PCOR/CER. We enhance
participatory research by including PCO leaders in training sessions and dissemination of findings, extending
our learning community beyond scholars and mentors. We move from opportunistic partnerships to formal,
sustainable partnerships with diverse PCOs to support embedded research. We add healthcare impact goals
and metrics, including on equity, to scholars’ development plans that set and track their training and research
objectives and progress. The benefits of this new model include bidirectional learning, enhanced relevance of
LHS research, proactively defining the value of research and building LHS capacity in partner PCOs. The
Center will (1) build new infrastructure for bidirectional research-health care partnerships, (2) train 7 early-
career researchers in embedded LHS research in partnership with PCO leaders, and (3) lead embedded LHS
research in participating PCOs. These activities will enable the Center to achieve its goals of producing a
diverse set of independent scientists with a solid foundation in LHS research who can change the paradigm of
primary care research through embedded research that rapidly develops and implements evidence; and
simultaneously building LHS capacity in safety net primary care settings."

Between 40-70% of children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) on contemporary protocols exhibit
measurable deficits in cognitive functioning, which negatively impacts school and occupational performance,
and diminishes quality of life. However, the specific processing deficits contributing to poor cognitive
functioning in survivors of childhood ALL and the implications for ongoing brain development are poorly
understood. The goal of this project is to characterize treatment-related effects on brain functions (Aim 1),
identify abnormal patterns of neural connectivity (Aim 2), and assess chronic effects of chemotherapy
treatment on the development of cognitive skills (Aim 3) in childhood survivors. We achieve these aims by
using a combination of behavioral, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging measures to demonstrate effects on
neurocognitive function, brain activity and brain development following chemotherapy compared to healthy,
matched controls. Our study is designed to identify the relative contributions of sensory processes, memory,
and attentional mechanisms, and cortical-maturation delays to poor performance on standardized tests of
cognition function. Our approach will lead to the development of a powerful set of tools for identifying children
with persistent treatment-related changes in cognitive functioning due to exposure to toxic therapy. Results will
differentiate the level at which processing deficits occur (Aims 1 and 2), and longitudinally assess cognitive
development (Aim 3) and the associated development in brain function and pathways in survivors of childhood
ALL. This contribution is significant because defining the loci of neurocognitive dysfunction caused by ALL
treatment would guide the development of novel preventive, treatment, and intervention strategies."
10813853,"Recent studies suggest that the gut microbiome can influence fertility and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis through modifications of bile acids. The overall goal of this study is to determine whether the gut microbiome’s modulation of bile acids affects reproductive function and fertility. To have a better mechanistic understanding of how bacterial bile acid modifications affect reproductive health, there is a critical need for a tool that will introduce specific bacterial biotransformations into the gut microbiome and investigate their effects on the host HPG axis. An innovation of this proposal is a new strategy that allows us to quickly and effectively knock- in a beneficial function in a sustained manner, for perpetuity, by engineering the host’s native bacteria to induce a physiological change. The candidate will use this tool to address her central hypothesis, that bile acids are key modulators of the HPG axis and fertility. In the next three years, the candidate will pursue the proposal’s central hypothesis with three specific aims. The first aim will determine how bacterial bile acid biotransformations in the gut microbiome affect fertility in both male and female mice. By using engineered native bacteria to increase bile acid deconjugation, the candidate will determine the effect of altered bile acid composition on serum sex hormones and other markers host fertility. Overall, this aim will determine if there is sexual dimorphism in microbiome modulation of bile acids and host reproductive health. In the second aim, the candidate will evaluate the effect of bile signaling modulation and reduced serum androgen levels, shown in my preliminary results, on fecundity in a cohort of male mice. This will determine whether bile acid biotransformations elicit a strong enough effect on the reproductive axis to reduce fecundity in males. The third aim will determine whether the nuclear bile acid receptor, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), is necessary for the effect of bacterial bile acid biotransformations on testosterone levels. Ultimately, this aim will determine whether this receptor is a novel therapeutic target to manipulate fertility and fecundity. The expected outcome of these studies is further clarity about the relationship between bile acid signaling and reproductive health. The positive translational impact includes the determination of whether the gut microbiome can be used to better understand, and potentially treat, male and female subfertility. The candidate is an exceptional scientist whose goal is to become an independent scientist investigating the relationship between the gut microbiome and host reproductive health. Her training goals include developing expertise in reproductive physiology, designing microbiome experiments, developing expertise in animal models of disease, learning the skills necessary to become an independent researcher, and building her professional network. To accomplish these training goals, the candidate has outlined a plan with hands-on bench research, coursework, seminars, national meetings, and other career development opportunities under the guidance of mentorship committee led by Drs. Amir Zarrinpar and Pamela Mellon."
10812837,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Due to the overwhelming success of the new mRNA vaccines during the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, vaccines have
entered the public consciousness to a level not seen since the days of smallpox eradication and the polio
epidemic. It seems reasonable to assume that the established rules governing T cell responses to infections
might be useful in developing better subunit vaccine formulations. However, there is mounting evidence that the
immunological mechanisms relevant to adjuvant-elicited cellular immunity are vastly different than those
observed in response to infectious challenge. Over the last 20 years, we have published extensively on a growing
list of factors that highlight the mechanistic distinctions between vaccine-elicited (Tvacs) and infection-elicited
(Tinf) T cell responses in mice and non-human primates. Our most recent data has revealed additional features
mechanistically unique to Tvacs. Whereas Tinf split their functions between 2 different cell types and either divide
or become memory, Tvacs do both within the same cell. Our data support an entirely novel model of CD8+ T
cell activation whereby two transcription factors normally opposed to one another in function instead cooperate
to sustain Tvacs exponential clonal expansion as well as a memory cell fate. The goals of this project will be to
understand how these transcription factors cooperate instead of competing to support a vaccine-elicited T cell's
transcriptional and metabolic needs."
10814209,"Abstract
 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly and the sixth leading cause
of death in the US. Over 25 million people are affected by the disease and as the aging population increases,
this number is expected to double by 2025. Characteristics of AD include progressive memory loss, decline in
cognitive skills, and adverse behavioral changes. The hallmark brain neuropathologies of AD include the
accumulation of extracellular amyloid-b (Ab) plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by
aggregates of all 6 tau isoforms, early synaptotoxicity and neurotransmitter alterations, gliosis, and ultimately
neuronal loss and brain atrophy. Since there is currently no disease modifying treatment for AD, there remains
a pressing need for development of therapies that can stop or slow its progression. However, research to develop
and evaluate novel AD therapies is hampered by an incomplete understanding of the precise etiology of the
disease and a lack of imaging biomarkers sensitive to specific pre-symptomatic molecular changes underlying
AD onset and progression that are translatable to human studies.
 Emerging data suggests that early cognitive changes in AD may be due to the dysregulation of excitatory
glutamatergic neurotransmission by soluble Ab oligomers, which lead to tau phosphorylation, over stimulation of
glutamate receptors and synaptic alterations. Oligomeric Ab also impairs the normal function of astrocytes,
thereby contributing to glutamate-mediated neuronal excitotoxicity and eventually to neurodegeneration in AD.
Since, synapse loss is the best correlate of memory deficits in AD, Ab plaques and/or NFTs may not capture
earliest changes that contribute to the initiating stages of AD. Accumulating data suggest that changes in
glutamatergic system function can potentially serve as a target for further mechanistic insights of AD and for the
development of both early biomarkers as well as disease modifying therapies for AD.
 Changes in glutamate (Glu) and myo-inositol (MI) observable noninvasively using magnetic resonance
imaging methods, may serve as surrogate biomarkers to probe dysregulation of the glutamatergic system due
to changes in synaptic density and astrocytic density, respectively. Although, 1H magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (MRS) is the standard approach for measuring these metabolites, it has lower spatial resolution
than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
 In this proposal, we will further develop and optimize recently introduced chemical exchange saturation
transfer (CEST) weighted imaging methods for measuring glutamate (GluCEST) and myo-inositol (MICEST) that
out-perform 1HMRS in terms of sensitivity and hence spatial resolution in measuring glutamate and myo-inositol,
respectively. Specifically, we will first establish the precision and specificity of the methods in measuring the
glutamate and myo-inositol in AD pathology. Then, we will perform CEST MRI in AD mouse models (APP-KI,
AD-APP-KI) that closely recapitulate human AD, as a function of disease onset and progression, and determine
the association of changes in these indices with the changes in the immunohistochemistry (IHC) derived
measures of synaptic and astrocytic density. Successful completion of the proposed project will lead to: (i)
mechanistic information about critical role that glutamatergic system plays in the initiating stages of the disease
and progression (ii) validated and clinically translatable noninvasive imaging biomarkers that measure disease
at the pre-symptomatic stages and follow it longitudinally (iii) noninvasive biomarkers that can be used to identify
disease targets and longitudinally evaluate potential disease modifying therapies and thereby contribute to the
enhanced patient care."
10812925,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a neurovascular complication of diabetes mellitus and the leading cause of blindness
in adults. Prevention of hyperglycemia-induced retinal microvascular dysfunction remains one of the therapeutic
goal to preserve vision in diabetic patients. Recent insights from our group and others have shown that
hyperglycemia results in retinal endothelial cells (RECs) stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS), a
senomorphic process characterized by the acquisition of the so-called senescence-associated secretory
phenotype (SASP) and linked to chronic inflammation. The exact causes and consequences of this mechanism
and its relative impact in DR are presently unknown and understudied. Evidence provided by the literature and
our own preliminary results suggests that central to the development of SIPS is the increased expression and
activity of the histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) paralleled by loss of the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase
SIRT-1. This imbalance results in a switch in cell acetylome that has proven to result in mitochondrial dysfunction
and has been linked to the pathogenesis of a number of pathologies including diabetic complications and
neurodegeneration. In addition, we have found that exosomes isolated from diabetic RECs could propagate
senomorphic and pro-inflammatory signals to neighboring vascular cells and to recruited neutrophils to promote
degenerative changes such as netosis. Our overall working hypothesis is that altered SIRT-1-HDAC6 balance
leads to exosomes-mediated retinal vascular SIPS and strategies aimed at halting this process could have
therapeutic value to prevent/combat diabetic retinal microangiopathy and, potentially, DR. We have designed
studies to validate our working hypothesis, but also aimed at extending the present knowledge of the molecular
and cellular mechanisms promoting microangiopathy in the diabetic retina. Our aims are: Aim1 To investigate
the contribution of HDAC6 to retinal vascular senescence, diabetic microangiopathy and DR. Aim2 To
investigate the effects of enhancing/rescuing SIRT1 on vascular senescence, diabetic retinal microangiopathy,
and DR. The results of our proposed studies will unveil an important pathogenic hub by confirming the existence
of a negative feedback between HDAC6 and SIRT-1 and by revealing specific acetylome and exosomes
signatures, thus enabling the identification of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools for retinal microangiopathy
and DR."

Our long-term goal is to understand how rotavirus (RV) exploits cellular pathways such as autophagy
membranes, calcium homeostasis, and lipid droplet (LD) formation to enhance their replication and cause
disease. RVs remain significant human pathogens in spite of the introduction of vaccines. Several aspects of RV
replication are unique yet broadly relevant to other viruses, such as cytoplasmic organelles (viroplasms, VI)
formed by both viral and cellular proteins and LDs that form a physical platform for efficient viral replication and
maturation. LDs are dynamic, multi-functional intracellular organelles involved in lipid storage and metabolism
as well as in signal transduction, membrane trafficking and modulation of immune and inflammatory responses.
LDs play essential roles in several viral and intracellular bacterial infections and are important in many aspects
of health and disease (metabolism, diabetes, obesity, heart disease). However, mechanistic information of the
interplay between lipid accumulation and these pathogens, and disease is far from complete. Our proposed
studies on LDs and VIs build on our recent work. While the viral proteins NSP2 and NSP5 are known to be
required for VI formation, the molecular mechanisms of how these two proteins associate with each other as well
as with other viral and cellular proteins and LD components to form VI/LDs remain to be elucidated. We
discovered two forms of NSP2 that interact with different isoforms of NSP5: a dispersed (dNSP2) form interacts
with hypo-phosphorylated NSP5 and a previously recognized VI (vNSP2) form interacts with hyper-
phosphorylated NSP5. We elucidated a novel phosphorylation-dependent mechanism for VI formation, in which
the ubiquitous, constitutively active cellular protein kinase CK1α partially controls the assembly of RV VIs by
phosphorylating NSP2 to trigger NSP2 octamer-octamer lattice formation. We also discovered that NSP2 is an
autokinase and predict that NSP2 may phosphorylate other viral or cellular proteins for VI assembly and RV
replication. We hypothesize that interactions of RV and cellular proteins in specialized microdomains of the
endoplasmic reticulum nucleate and induce VI/LDs essential for virus replication, affect the composition of the
LD-associated proteins and result in previously unrecognized mechanisms of RV-induced pathogenesis. We
propose experiments to answer three questions. (1) How do NSP4, NSP2 and specialized microdomains in the
ER lead to nucleation of VI/LDs? (2) How does phosphorylation orchestrate VI formation and the conversion of
dNSP2 to vNSP2 to initiate VI/LD formation and subsequent VI/LD maturation? (3) How does DGAT1
degradation lead to LD formation and what are the specific roles of PLIN1 and PLIN3 LDs in RV infection and
pathogenesis? These studies are significant because viral perturbations of host signaling and metabolic
pathways that involve LDs are critical for multiple pathogens. Because RVs replicate in enterocytes in the small
intestine, the major site of fat absorption in the body, understanding the effects of RV infection on LD biology
has the potential to reveal new insights into the consequences of virus infection on host metabolism."

Candidate: Dr. Medina Jackson-Browne, PhD is an environmental epidemiologist with primary research
interests in the role of early-life environmental chemical exposures on the immune and respiratory systems
in children. The goal of this proposal is to obtain training in the skills to build Dr. Jackson-Browne’s research
career in pediatric clinical research. We propose several initiatives to strengthen Dr. Jackson-Browne’s
career. Specifically, Dr. Jackson-Browne will gain new research skills and enhance her understanding of
1) the clinical trial process with Dr. Phipatanakul, MD, 2) train in early-childhood immune system
development and respiratory physiology and 3) translate this research and training to position her for a
future R01. To achieve this goal, she will obtain training in clinical trial design, database design and
management, and advanced biostatistical methods. This will be accomplished with formal coursework,
collaborative work, attendance at conferences, and guidance from established mentors/scientific advisors
with relevant expertise. The proposed research and training plan builds the foundation for an independent
research career that aims to address gaps in the understanding of timing and mechanism through which
environmental chemical exposure affect respiratory health in early childhood.
Research: Early-life exposure to environmental chemicals, particularly chemical’s known to bioaccumulate
in humans, is of increasing concern in the development of asthma in children. Aeroallergen sensitization
is a pivotal risk factor for developing persistent, progressive asthma throughout life and sensitized children
have a higher prevalence of early-life wheeze and poor lung function. These potential associations are
particularly relevant to populations with higher exposure to these chemicals and those at a higher risk for
developing and/or dying from complications from asthma such as Black and low-income urban children.
This proposal details a five-year plan to provide Dr. Jackson-Browne with the training and expertise to
address gaps in the understanding of the timing through which perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) exposures
may affect asthma development in children by leveraging infrastructure of an on-going pediatric clinical
trial of 2-3-year-old infants at high risk of developing asthma (PI, Dr. Wanda Phipatanakul, MD).
Environment: Dr. Jackson-Browne will be mentored by Dr. Phipatanakul, an expert in epidemiology,
clinical trials, and clinical investigation in asthma and allergic diseases. She has assembled an
extraordinary team of advisors, including Drs. Jessie Buckley, Stephanie Lovinsky-Desir and Suzanne
Dahlberg who have committed their time, resources, and expertise to facilitate Dr. Jackson-Browne’s
career development and successful completion of the proposed project. The academic environment
created Boston Children’s Hospital and their affiliates provides an ideal training environment specific to
her goals of achieving research independence."

Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is a public health priority and is well-established as a
health disparity for some racial and ethnically minoritized groups. Transgender and gender diverse (TGD)
people (i.e., those with a gender identity that differs from their sex assigned at birth) are a marginalized group
that share many of the same psychosocial stressors and adverse health conditions linked to ADRD risk among
cisgender adults (non-TGD) from minoritized ethnoracial communities. Yet, little is known about the
epidemiology of and risk factors for ADRD among TGD adults. Most existing ADRD research was not designed
to identify TGD participants or assess how ADRD risk is affected by TGD-specific experiences and
psychosocial stressors (e.g., TGD status disclosure, gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) use, anti-TGD
discrimination). It is also unclear if ADRD prevalence and risk vary by TGD subgroups (e.g., transfeminine,
transmasculine, nonbinary) or those using GAHT. The overarching goal of this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented
Research Career Development Award is to provide the applicant with the skills necessary to become an
independent researcher and a leader in ADRD and cognitive aging among TGD adults. Specific training goals
include: 1) Develop proficiency in advanced statistical methods for the analysis of longitudinal data; 2)
Enhance skills in qualitative and mixed methods research, 3) Cultivate a more nuanced understanding of key
influences on ADRD and cognitive function among TGD adults and obtain training in cognitive function
assessment; and 4) Build expertise in community-engaged research that equitably and meaningfully involves
TGD community members throughout the research process. The research proposed in this K23 will first
examine the epidemiology of ADRD among TGD adults using Kaiser Permanente electronic health record
(EHR) data from the ongoing Study of Transition, Outcomes and Gender (STRONG, R01AG066956, PI:
Goodman). To enhance our knowledge about ADRD risk among TGD adults and move towards understanding
the mechanisms contributing to ADRD disparities, we will then collect detailed and focused participant data
using qualitative methods. Among a community-based sample of TGD adults, this study component will
explore TGD-specific experiences and psychosocial stressors expected to influence ADRD risk and cognitive
impairment. Finally, we will develop and pilot test a data collection protocol that objectively assesses cognitive
function, TGD psychosocial stressors, and ADRD risk/protective factors among a cohort of middle-aged and
older TGD adults. Research findings are expected to inform clinical practice and research by determining the
extent of ADRD disparities among TGD adults and across TGD subgroups, discerning TGD-specific
psychosocial-related mechanisms associated with ADRD disparities, and establishing a protocol for a full-scale
prospective cohort study of brain health and ADRD risk among TGD adults."

Germ cells have the potential to generate every cell type in the body. Specified in the embryo, germ cells face
the challenge of protecting and maintaining this poised totipotency for the entirety of an organism’s reproductive
lifespan. Despite the fundamental importance of this protection for the fertility and health of the next generation,
the molecular programs that promote and protect germ cell identity are poorly understood. A specific program
for germ cell transcriptional activation has yet to be described, largely because a ‘master regulator transcription
factor’ for germ cell fate has not been identified in any organism. Instead, primordial germ cells (PGCs) rely on
conserved networks of RNA regulators that repress somatic differentiation programs and protect the germline
genetic program, a strategy that is common to PGCs of worms, flies, mice, and humans. Yet how these RNA
regulators intersect with the gene regulatory network of PGCs is unknown. My proposed research program seeks
to uncover the molecular mechanisms that initiate and maintain germ cell identity by revealing the PGC gene
regulatory network. The goal of the research proposed here is to (a) uncover mechanisms that ‘repress’ the
somatic program thereby allowing the PGC program to develop and (b) identify the ‘instructive’ cues that actively
control PGC fate. In Aim 1, I focus on discovering the dynamics of germline gene activation during
embryogenesis by identifying specific, temporally regulated sets of genes that define the PGC transcriptional
program using single-cell RNA sequencing. Using tissue-specific interference, I will distinguish between cell-
intrinsic and non-autonomous signaling mechanisms regulating the PGC transcriptional program. In Aim 2, I will
probe the ‘instructive’ cues of germ cell identity by uncovering PGC-specific cis-regulatory sequences using
ATAC-seq. I will identify transcriptional regulators (such as transcription factors/chromatin factors) that bind these
cis-regulatory sequences and test their role in the PGC transcriptional program. In Aim 3, I address the
‘repressive’ model by examining the function of a critical regulator of germ cell fate, the conserved RNA-binding
protein Nanos. Using the RNA target identification method HyperTRIBE, I will identify Nanos targets and ask
whether these targets promote the germline program and/or repress somatic programs. I will use Drosophila as
my model system, expanding my prior training in biochemistry and molecular biology to encompass organismal
biology, development, and genetics and gaining expertise in bioinformatics and gene regulation. Together, this
work will uncover the regulatory landscape of primordial germ cells, providing a fundamental understanding of
the mechanisms that specify germ cell fate, promote fertility, and ultimately protect the survival of the species."

Dr. Emily Choquette is applying for the Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) to
support her growth as an independent researcher focusing on understanding the pathophysiology of body
image disturbance (BID). BID is a key diagnostic feature of AN that is associated with poor outcomes including
relapse following hospital discharge. Perceptual BID is a complex process involving the integration of bodily
signals (interoception), afferent visual stimuli, and mental representations of one's body. Specifically, there is
evidence that BID is related to an imbalance of sensitivity to interoceptive and exteroceptive signaling in AN,
which facilitates self-objectification (seeing one's body as an object) and results in an inaccurate representation
of the body (i.e., perceiving one's body as larger than its true size). The proposed study will be the first to
systematically examine associations between BID and interoception using several levels of analysis (i.e., self-
report and behavioral assays) combined with perturbations of interoceptive (i.e., Reduced Environmental
Stimulation Therapy via floatation) and cognitive (i.e., acceptance based cognitive principles) processing to
examine the causal role of interoception on perceptual BID. The aims of the current project are to (1) examine
how a cognitive versus interoceptive intervention paired with cognitive manipulation acutely changes
BID in AN; (2) determine cross-sectional multimodal associations between interoception and BID in
AN; and (3) explore longitudinal associations and mechanistic mediators of BID change in AN. The
current project will use a randomized parallel-group experimental therapeutic design to explore a mechanistic
framework suggesting disrupted interoceptive processing produces disturbed body image. This project will
advance current scientific knowledge of the relationship between BID and interoception and pave the way for
future mechanistically informed treatment techniques for BID in eating disorders. The rigorous training plan
proposed by Dr. Choquette includes formal course work, didactics, and mentorship from a team of highly
qualified mentors and consultants. These training activities will allow Dr. Choquette to develop an expertise in
psychophysiology research methodology, advanced statistics, and content area expertise needed to progress
towards independence as a clinical scientist. The training location, Laureate Institute for Brain Research
(LIBR), is a state-of-the-art research institution with a history of supporting early career scientists transition to
independence. Further, LIBR is home to the Float Clinic and Research Lab and co-located with the Laureate
Eating Disorder Program which will facilitate completion of the proposed project. The current project will be the
next logical and imperative step in Dr. Choquette's career and will support her pursuit of her career goal of
developing mechanistically informed treatments for BID in eating disorders."
10789961,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Visual attention, the ability to select relevant information for prioritized processing, is a fundamental mechanism
for parsing a complex visual world. Importantly, attention is dynamic, acting across time to prioritize information
at behaviorally relevant moments, a process known as temporal attention. Although we know that temporal
attention affects visual perception, the neural mechanisms underlying temporal attention have been little
investigated. Specifically, it remains unknown 1) where in the human brain temporal attention influences visual
processing and 2) what cortical networks control the allocation of visual temporal attention. Here I propose to
investigate the sensory and control mechanisms of temporal attention using contemporary methods in human
visual neuroscience. The high spatial resolution of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) makes it an
ideal tool for investigating the roles of specific cortical areas; however, its slow temporal resolution has obscured
its potential value in studies of temporal attention. To circumvent this limitation, in Aim 1 I will use decoding
together with a tailored experimental design to determine where in the visual cortex temporal attention modulates
sensory processing. In Aim 2 I will use individual-observer mapping to identify control networks that guide
temporal attention and further analyze regions of interest to distinguish between possible control mechanisms.
In Aim 3 I will use the data collected in Aims 1 and 2 to test predictions of a recently introduced dynamic
normalization model of temporal attention and, if warranted, update its architecture and parameters to better
predict the neuroimaging data. Together these experiments and modeling will advance our understanding of the
neural mechanisms of temporal attention as well as our computational theories of dynamic attention.
Understanding these basic mechanisms is relevant for clinical populations with impairments in visual temporal
attention, including individuals with ADHD, neglect, and cerebellar degeneration."

Dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury (AKI-D) is a profoundly life-altering event for which there are currently no
treatments to improve the chances of renal recovery. Moreover, there are no clinical guidelines to help
clinicians determine when to discontinue dialysis in AKI-D as the kidneys recover. Earlier and more frequent
dialysis discontinuation would have powerful impacts on patient quality of life, life expectancy, and healthcare
costs. The overarching theme of this proposal is to investigate ways to foster earlier and more frequent
recovery from AKI-D, allowing independence from acute dialysis. The three specific aims are:
Aim 1: To quantify the association between measured creatinine clearance (CrCl) from timed urine collections
and the risk of requiring another dialysis treatment in the next week among hospitalized patients with AKI-D.
Aim 2: To evaluate the associations among urinary biomarkers of injury and repair and renal recovery among
hospitalized patients with AKI-D.
Aim 3: To pilot a separate outpatient trial evaluating the feasibility, tolerability, and safety of a multicomponent
intervention (cooled dialysate, high sodium dialysate, high dose diuretics) designed to prevent intradialytic
hypotension during the course of established AKI-D.
This K23 proposal will give Ian McCoy, MD, MS the protected time, mentorship, training, and research
experience needed to become independent in patient-oriented research. Dr. McCoy is a board-certified
nephrologist and clinical researcher, establishing himself as a young investigator in AKI. He has published
several first-authored, peer-reviewed manuscripts on AKI, completed a Master’s degree in Epidemiology, and
turned down other job offers to pursue a career in clinical AKI research. Dr. McCoy came to UCSF to take
advantage of the research infrastructure of an ongoing randomized controlled trial enrolling AKI-D patients in
the hospital established by his mentors Drs. Chi-yuan Hsu and Kathleen Liu (The Liberation from Acute
Dialysis [LIBERATE-D]) study. Drs. Hsu and Liu together with Dr. John Neuhaus make a world-class mentoring
team with relevant expertise in clinical research in AKI and biostatistics. All three aims are innovative and
importantly feasible within a K23 timeline and scope of work. Somewhat unusual for a career development
award, the aims in this proposal have the potential to directly change clinical practice. For instance, measured
CrCl from timed urine collections are commonly used in routine clinical practice (Aim 1), and several of the
biomarkers being evaluated (NGAL, TIMP-2*IGFBP7) are commercially available (Aim 2). The pilot trial
proposed in Aim 3 may eventually lead to a practice-changing multicenter trial if successful. In the next five
years, Dr. McCoy will gain experience in primary data collection and interventional trials, and obtain
independent research funding (R01 or equivalent) for further investigations in AKI."
10789963,"Project Summary:
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is associated with persistent immune activation and dysfunction, even
during suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) that was initiated early post-infection. Perinatally acquired HIV
(PHIV) infection and lifelong ART likely alter the development and function of the immune system. The
exposure of HIV and ART in utero, the decades of ART therapy, the lasting effects of older toxic ART with
mitochondrial toxicity and the long-term sub-optimal adherence known to occur with prolonged ART use,
heighten concern that sequelae of HIV and ART in children and adolescents may be more frequent and
potentially more devastating than in adults. Better understanding of immune dysfunction in PHIV is crucial, as it
is often easier to limit or even reverse comorbidities at an early stage. We are exploring the consequences of
PHIV and its treatment with ART in a cohort of adolescents in Uganda and have reported significant
differences in the immune profiles of HIV- and HIV+ children. These differences may be driven by trained
immunity, a process by which cells of the innate immune system (e.g. monocytes, macrophages and natural
killer cells) are reprogrammed to respond differently to subsequent exposure to microbial products and
proinflammatory lipids. Recent studies, including our own, demonstrate that ART exposure may also contribute
to alterations in immune cell activation, potentially through decreased mitochondrial function and through
modulation of intracellular signaling cascades. The knowledge gained from this proposal could be substantial,
and from a translational perspective will lay the foundation to identify key pathways with biological, clinical, and
prognostic relevance for adolescents who are advancing into adulthood. These results could inform
intervention trials to mitigate the development of comorbidities associated with immune activation. We propose:
Aim 1: To measure innate immune profiles (i.e monocytes and NK cells) in adolescents with and without HIV in
Uganda and the United States.
Aim 2: To identify the role of trained immunity in innate immune modulation in adolescents with and without
HIV infection in Uganda.
Aim 3: To evaluate how mitochondrial function plays a role in innate immune profiles longitudinally in
adolescents with and without HIV in Uganda.
This proposal combines a well-characterized cohort of children with and without PHIV with ex vivo and in vitro
assessments of immune cell phenotype and function. We will use high-dimensional flow cytometry analyses,
single cell transcriptional profiling, and an in-depth analytical approach to define the potential mechanisms
whereby chronic exposure to ART, microbial products, and clinical and environmental factors may contribute to
innate immune cell activation or dysfunction. This is a continuation of a highly successful collaboration among
the study team members and we are well positioned to perform this innovative project."
10785801,"A major impediment to the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) is its extensive intratumoral heterogeneity:
Each GBM tumor is heterogeneous with respect to genetics, immune microenvironment, and tumor cell
state. In particular, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed that each GBM is a mixture of
different types of tumor cells, each with different biological properties, or cell states. Consequently, it may
be necessary to treat each patient with personalized drug combinations. Although scRNA-seq has enabled
us to understand the complexity of GBM, its clinical potential is largely untapped. This is partly because it
is difficult to physically isolate and study the cell types discovered using scRNA-seq. In previous work, we
showed that cell surface markers identified through scRNA-seq can be used to purify tumor subpopulations
using flow sorting. Building on this, we propose a novel approach to isolating GBM cell populations,
studying their therapeutic vulnerabilities, and identifying personalized drug combinations that target
multiple cell populations simultaneously. Our approach is based on CITE-seq (Cellular Indexing of
Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing), an extension of scRNA-seq that will enable us to efficiently
define tumor cell populations and isolate them using flow sorting. We will test the drug sensitivities of each
cell population, and then identify combinations of drugs that more effectively eradicate the tumor. This
approach will be developed through two Specific Aims: (1) We will isolate and characterize GBM
subpopulations using CITE-seq and flow sorting. Using our preliminary scRNA-seq data, we identified a
panel of candidate cell-surface markers for known GBM subpopulations. Using oligo-conjugated antibodies
to these putative markers, we will perform CITE-seq in primary tumors and matched cell lines to determine
which markers cleanly distinguish among tumor cell populations. Using the most promising markers, we
will test and optimize our ability to separate GBM samples into distinct subpopulations using flow sorting.
In doing so, we will test the hypothesis that there exist stable GBM cell states that persist after flow sorting.
(2) We will perform drug-screening on flow-sorted GBM subpopulations to identify personalized drug
combinations. To this end, we will isolate several subpopulations from each of five cell lines using flow
sorting, then test each subpopulation (as well as the flow-through and the unsorted cell lines) for sensitivity
to each of 960 FDA-approved drugs including temozolomide (current standard of care), and specific
combinations thereof. The resulting drug sensitivity matrix will be analyzed using clustering and machine
learning techniques to identify drugs that, when used in combination, will target multiple GBM
subpopulations and achieve greater efficacy than a single drug alone. If this approach is promising in pilot
experiments, we ultimately hope to expand and adapt it to the clinic, so that we can readily identify drug
combinations for any individual’s tumor."
10785804,"Global plastic pollution is a significant environmental and public health concern. Plastic production has
increased since the 1950s, reaching approximately 368 million metric tons in 2019. Approximately 60% of all
plastics ever produced are disposed of, leading to pervasive contamination of our ecosystem with microplastic
particles. Microplastics are a concern for public health given their resistance to degradation, presence in air,
food and products relevant to human exposure, and demonstrated ability to cross cell membranes. Human
exposure via inhalation and ingestion is unavoidable with recent evidence-based estimates suggesting humans
intake tens of thousands of microplastic particles annually, or on the order of several milligrams daily.
Understanding the extent to which microplastics are absorbed is a critical next step in evaluating their
relevance to human health. The overarching aim of this research is to translate methods that have been
developed for measuring microplastics in environmental samples and marine tissues for use with human
biospecimens. Specifically, by leveraging the relatively accessible placenta, we propose an approach to
measure and characterize microplastics in tissue collected from the general population of pregnant people. We
will also investigate sources of exposure, including modifiable lifestyle factors, as well as sources of
contamination present in the labor and delivery room and during sample processing. The proposed research
will leverage existing infrastructure from the N
(NYU CHES), an ongoing prospective birth cohort designed to study prenatal exposure to endocrine disrupting
chemicals on a range of perinatal and child health outcomes. Maternal urinary concentrations of bisphenol and
phthalate chemicals will also be measured during pregnancy. This will allow us to examine patterns of joint
exposure to chemical plastic additives and plastic particles. In sum, we anticipate results from this research will
provide critical insights on the extent to which humans are exposed to microplastics. This information may
significantly alter our view of plastics as inert particles that pass through the human system and lead to a
reassessment of the risks posed by microplastics exposure."
10797469,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We propose to renew the Southern New England Partnership In Stroke Research, Innovation and Treatment (SPIRIT), a StrokeNet Regional Coordinating Center (RCC) anchored previously by 3 leading institutions: Yale School of Medicine, the Warren Alpert School of Medicine at Brown University, and Hartford Hospital. During the prior cycle, SPIRIT was the 4th highest national enroller of a high quality, diverse patient population. It is now further augmented by the addition of Northwell Health in Long Island and New York, with a proven track record of recruitment and collaboration. SPIRIT captures a diverse geographic area that provides access to 8.7 million people, including most adult and pediatric stroke patients in Connecticut and Rhode Island. This robust patient volume (over 6000 total stroke patients in 2022) is combined with an exceptionally strong collaborative and organizational framework. Principal Investigators Dr. Kevin N. Sheth (Yale), Dr. Karen Furie (Brown), Dr. Mark Alberts (Hartford Hospital), and Dr. Richard Temes (Northwell) bring a complementary set of leadership and high-level clinical trials experience in stroke. Each leader brings well recognized expertise in international multicenter studies and implementation of stroke systems of care, as well as a track record of high-quality stroke trial recruitment and retention. In various capacities, they have worked together for over 17 years, and each PI leads an enthusiastic cadre of faculty across disciplines, to create a highly collaborative environment focused on stroke research, multicenter trials, membership on Institutional Review Boards, clinical trial committees, and extensive mentoring in patient-oriented research. SPIRIT maintains strong connections to NIH funded CTSA networks and is further strengthened by the following characteristics: 1) A pool of talented investigators with nationally recognized clinical and translational research expertise in stroke; 2) Rich diversity (both ethnic/racial as well as urban/rural) of patients in Southern New England and New York; 3) Active leadership and participation in stroke communities and stroke systems of care in the areas of statewide policy, continuity of care, American Heart Association collaborations and regional education; 4) Deep investigator and patient pools for all three areas of StrokeNet initiatives – prevention, acute treatment, and recovery; 5) Access to a range of specialized tools already harmonized across centers including a common electronic medical record system (EPIC), enhancing data sharing and collaboration; 6) Continuous commitment from all four institutions to the central IRB model and use of a Master Trial Agreement; 7) Rich science core with ongoing SPIRIT initiated, NIH funded stroke studies (ASPIRE, CAPTIVA-MRI) and other proposals currently under review; and 8) An education core designed to identify, support and accelerate the development of tomorrow's stroke investigators. The Yale, Brown, Hartford and Northwell stroke teams together – where the sum of the collaboration is even more exciting than each part – is poised to continue leading, making significant contributions to further the mission of NINDS StrokeNet to reduce the burden of neurological disease."
10930928,"Kidney disease affects nearly one in three adults worldwide and is associated with significant morbidity and
mortality. Throughout the last three decades there has been tremendous progress in understanding kidney
disease mechanisms that have led recently to new therapies including healthcare delivery strategies to
enhance delivery of health information and promote successful self-care, however quality of life as well as
survival remains poor especially for those living with advanced kidney disease including kidney failure.
Importantly the NIH/NIDDK has invested in ensuring that patient partners are integral to the process of
prioritizing as well as carrying out research. Similarly, NIH/NIDDK is further investing in ensuring the academic
research workforce is also diverse and representative. This is a critical objective across the spectrum of kidney
disease research including basic science, clinical and translational, and policy research. Dr. Cavanaugh is a
well recognized expert in kidney disease clinical trials, health literacy and its implications, formative research to
elucidate and integrate stakeholder perspectives into research and community engagement. Her objective is
to use the support of the K26 NIDDK Investigator Award to Support Mentoring of Early Career Researchers
from Diverse Backgrounds to focus on training the next generation of scientists to bring transformative
advancements in kidney disease research. The candidate’s immediate and long-term career objectives to be a
leader in research faculty development are directly in line with the goals of the NIH K26 award, to provide
support for protected time for awardees to devote to mentoring training and culturally-sensitive mentoring for
post-doctoral students. Specifically, this award will allow her to focus on the development of a multi-level
mentoring program to facilitate the career development of emerging early investigators. This award will provide
protected time for the candidate to devote specifically to executing rigorous research, serving as a primary,
collaborative, advocacy and network mentor, and to developing mentoring skills in research. Her objective is to
recruit and mentor post-doctoral fellows and junior faculty for successful clinical research careers in kidney
disease and to support the career advancement of her current trainees. She will accomplish this objective by
leveraging her research program resources as well as the robust institutional, regional and national resources.
The aims include (a) continued impactful research to expand opportunities for mentees; (b) development and
deployment of a novel culturally tailored psychological and instrumental advocacy kidney disease research
mentor program; (c) acquisition of mentoring skills training informed by an expert advisory committee; and (d)
execution of recruitment programs to identify and engage mentees from diverse backgrounds. Completion of
these aims will enhance the career advancement of kidney disease scientists from diverse backgrounds to
diversify and grow the future workforce of faculty dedicated to understanding and eliminating kidney disease."
10815845,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Life course theory emphasizes that aging is a trajectory that starts early in life, and as such, individual
heterogeneity in aging is rooted in a lifetime of health exposures and the environments in which we live. This
perspective is critical for understanding the nature and modifiability of health inequalities among the aged.
However, it has been extraordinarily difficult to put life course perspectives into practice, owing to the long
timeframes necessary to study humans and the difficulty of operationalizing relevant features of human
environments. We propose that these problems can be rectified by studying an underused model system,
chimpanzees. This research extends a longitudinal study aimed at investigating the biology of aging in
chimpanzees, one of our closest living relatives and a critical link for reconstructing how the human aging
process evolved. This close evolutionary relationship results in genetic and physiological similarities that are
not represented by common laboratory animal models. Chimpanzees are socially-complex and long-lived,
meaning that they are particularly well suited to study how environmental factors such as the chronic burden of
infection, social support, and social inequality yield health effects across a lifetime. In our first funding period,
we validated a robust toolkit of non-invasive biomarkers of health and aging and used longitudinal sampling of
chimpanzees to establish how the chimpanzee aging process compares with humans. In the renewal period,
we build on those successes by addressing the multidimensionality of our longitudinal health data. Aim 1 will
extend the longitudinal health monitoring and biosampling of our original sample and increase the sample to a
total of 350 wild and 200 free-ranging chimpanzees. We will also develop accessible resources for comparative
aging research. Aim 2 will examine the hypothesis that the cumulative burden of infection across life is a
significant determinant of individual heterogeneity in aging. The immune system plays a pivotal role in the
aging process and has complex feedbacks on other aspects of senescence. Yet, the long lifespans of humans
evolved in environments where infectious challenges to the immune system were persistent. In wild
chimpanzees, we can study these dynamics in a system without medical intervention and where other age-
related pathologies are rare. Aim 3 builds upon Aim 2 by examining the hypothesis that social processes
modify aging trajectories. We are particularly interested in understanding the mechanisms by which social
support and status from early adulthood, when they are first established, contribute to later life health
disparities, and whether these impacts can be further modified by age-related shifts in social behavior.
Chimpanzees in our study populations have been closely observed for most or all of their adult lives, providing
a rare opportunity to apply objective, detailed social histories to the study of aging in the absence of major
lifestyle factors that complicate human studies."
10815758,"Antibiotic resistance has recently been identified as one of the three greatest threats facing mankind in the 21st
century by World Health Organization. One promising approach to combat antibiotic resistance is to reinvesti-
gate known antibiotics and design their derivatives, in the hope of identifying novel antibiotic agents that com-
bat antibiotic resistance. Hydantoins, the derivatives of 2,4-imidazolidinedione, have been developed for anti-
bacterial applications for long time. The mechanism of action for hydantoin derivatives is complex and not well
understood, possibly due to their damage to bacterial DNA, as well as bacterial ribosome binding and inhibition
of critical bacterial enzymes. One hydantoin derivative, nitrofurantoin, was approved to treat urinary tract infec-
tions. As an old antibiotic, it recently attracted considerable interest due to their low probability of bacterial re-
sistance compared to other conventional antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones, possibly owing to their mixed
mechanism of action. However, hydantoin derivatives including nitrofurantoin generally exhibit only moderate
antibacterial activity, which limits their further application in combating emergent antibiotic resistance.
 In the last RO1 period, we have developed a series of novel antimicrobial AApeptides. Through proper de-
sign and modification, we have recently developed a series of novel membrane-active hydantoin derivatives
derived from AApeptides that display potent and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity (25-100 fold of nitrofu-
rantoin) in vitro and in vivo. Our preliminary studies strongly suggest these compounds as a new approach for
antibiotic development. As such, our long-term goal is to develop novel antibiotic agents with novel mecha-
nisms to combat drug-resistant bacterial infections. The objective here, is to further develop these hydantoin
derivatives with greater potency through optimization of current lead compounds. Our central hypothesis is that
these agents, with proper design and modification, could be further improved in bacterial killing through novel
mechanisms. To test our central hypothesis and, thereby, accomplish the objective of this application, we will
first design and synthesize analogs of previously developed lead molecules, and identify more potent mole-
cules that are active against both Gram-positive Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (MIC ≤
0.5 µg/ml) and Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC ≤ 1 µg/mL). Next, we will study if bactericidal
mechanism of lead compounds involves membrane action, and assess their probability to elicit antibiotic re-
sistance. Furthermore, we will evaluate the in vivo activity of lead compounds in a thigh-infection mouse model,
in order to demonstrate their potential as a new generation of antibiotics with novel mechanisms.
 The work proposed is innovative because these compounds are a new class of hydantoin compounds that
kill both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with novel mechanisms. They are highly amendable for
derivatization and optimization, and possess low propensity to induce antibiotic resistance. The proposed work
is significant because currently there are no effective methods to combat emerging drug resistance. Our re-
search strategy will lead to a promising therapeutic approach to treat antibiotic resistant pathogens."
10815760,"Alzheimer’s disease is the most common incurable form of dementia affecting 50 million
individuals worldwide. Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the strongest genetic risk factor that is directly
linked to its pathogenesis. ApoE is a cholesterol- and lipid-carrier protein that has been implicated in
Alzheimer’s disease, aging, and other neurological disorders. Isoform-dependent effect on amyloid
accumulation and clearance have been found in humans and mice with APOE4 being detrimental.
Haploinsufficiency of ApoE4 and possibly ApoE3 decreases amyloid pathology. Low Density
Lipoprotein Receptor (LDLR) plays an important role in the endocytosis of ApoE proteins. LDLR
overexpression has been found to decrease ApoE levels and inhibit amyloid formation. Additionally,
ApoE’s role in lipidation influences Alzheimer’s pathogenesis. ATP-binding cassette transporter A1
(AbcA1) protein transfers cellular cholesterol onto extracellular lipid-poor apolipoproteins.
Overexpression of ABCA1 gene has also been found to inhibit amyloid formation. Therefore, we set
out to develop small organic molecules that can increase AbcA1 and/or Ldlr while decreasing ApoE
protein levels. Such compounds would likely reduce and clear amyloid plaque deposition in affected
brains and provide therapeutic benefit in Alzheimer’s disease.
 Five triarylmethyl amine (TAMA) small molecules emerged as first leads decreasing ApoE
protein level (>30% reduction in the human astrocytoma brain cell line, analyzed using ELISA). The
mechanism of action of the TAMA pharmacophore was via LXR antagonism. Structure-Activity
Relationship (SAR) studies on the TAMA pharmacophore in five phases of focused libraries, identified
five drug-like tertiaryl sulfonamides and aryl amines as new leads. They not only decreased ApoE levels
in vitro, but also increased AbcA1/Ldlr protein levels validated by concentration-dependent studies.
Three chiral leads in pure R/S forms had disproportionate effects on ApoE and AbcA1 raising the
possibility of multiple targets. One of the 8 leads, compound 127 modulated the target proteins in the
transgenic mice brains in preliminary in vivo studies. The successful in vivo efficacy of 127 validates its
ability to pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Preliminary in vitro toxicological experiments revealed all
the 8 lead compounds to be not toxic.
 The SuRE support will enable PI and his undergraduate/graduate research team to utilize the
TAMA pharmacophore with critical appendages identified in newer and more potent sulfonamide leads
to generate new and novel scaffolds-based leads. These scaffolds are expected to be lighter, drug-like,
chemically and pharmacokinetically stable, and less lipophilic. PI aims at performing chemical synthesis
and biological screening in his lab with the guidance of a committed consultant."
10821764,"Project Summary
 We propose to develop the novel Gene Therapy Catheter (GTC), an electrical pulsing (EP)
device designed to deliver adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy to the liver, increasing
the efficiency of the viral vector to achieve safer, more affordable, therapeutic outcomes.
 Liver-directed gene therapies show great promise for the treatment of monogenic diseases
due to the liver’s central role in metabolism. AAV has emerged as the leading vector for in vivo
liver-directed gene therapy treatment with more than 24 US clinical studies using AAV
completed or ongoing. However, to reach therapeutic effect, these treatments are often
delivered systemically with high vector dosages, which can trigger lethal immune responses and
are prohibitively expensive. This Phase I SBIR grant will explore an innovative approach to liver-
directed gene therapy that, if successful, could unlock the potential for curing a multitude of
monogenic liver diseases.
 The GTC is designed to safely increase the efficiency of AAV gene therapy to the liver. The
GTC combines local delivery with an electrode for EP and double balloons to isolate local tissue
from circulation, enabling the tissue to be flushed of preformed neutralizing antibodies (NAbs).
The GTC features a novel combination of elements to increase AAV hepatocyte transduction
while avoiding vector-mediated immunotoxicity. We hypothesize that the GTC will: a) enable
these therapies to achieve clinical benefit using <10% of the current range of AAV dose relative
to systemic administration; and b) reduce the risk of adverse events caused by high systemic
doses.1 Proving feasibility of the GTC’s EP enhanced transduction of hepatocytes in a large
animal model is the most compelling element of this work. Preliminary data justify building the
GTC prototype in Aim 1, optimizing electric field parameters in Aim 2, and demonstrating safety
and effectiveness in vivo in Aim 3. Phase II research, if awarded, will focus on developing the
technology toward Phase III commercialization, including refining the EP parameters and
functionality of the double balloons, leading to a fundamental advancement of care for many
patients in need of gene therapy.
1 The 40x increase in transduction seen in vitro (see Preliminary Research) equates to a 97.5% decrease in vector requirement. We
 theorize that 40x understates the true effect due to: a) multiplicity of infection at high dosage; and b) and not having reached the
 dilution point where +EP and -EP groups achieve the same outcome."

10820879,"Abstract –
Methadone, an opioid agonist therapy, is the most effective treatment for severe opioid use disorder
(OUD), and opioid treatment programs (OTPs) are the only medical settings allowed to administer this treatment.
People using fentanyl in particular require methadone, as these patients are more difficult to stabilize on opioid
agonist therapy. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the overdose epidemic in the United States with deaths
increasing 31% from 21.6 (per 100,000) in 2019 to 28.3 in 2020,2 with substantially larger increases in deaths
among individuals identified as Black and American Indian. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl contributed to 64% of
the more than 100,000 drug overdoses between May 2020 and April 2021. The 1972 Federal requirements for
daily observed dosing of methadone in OTPs were relaxed during the COVID-19 pandemic without increased
opioid overdoses and diversion. Thus, a March 2022 review of methadone regulations encouraged regulatory
revision to promote patient-centered care and facilitate access to take-home methadone. To safely and
effectively implement take-homes, however, OTPs need evidence that methadone is used as directed and not
diverted. To provide this evidence and facilitate methadone take-homes, Sonara Health designed Sonara
(from the Spanish word Soñará, “will dream”), a HIPAA-compliant web-application (app) that features
integrated video dosing recording of patients drinking the take-home dose, and a tamper-evident seal
that inhibits diversion attempts. Sonara also integrates an innovative measurement-based care (MBC)
framework called the Opioid Craving Visual Analogue Scale (OC-VAS). The OC-VAS monitors patient outcomes
in a personalized way and delivers this data to the care team, supporting more informed clinical decisions. In
Phase I of this SBIR, Sonara Health tested and improved the Sonara app and integrated the MBC tool into the
app. Patients and clinicians rated the Sonara Platform as usable, acceptable, and feasible for implementation in
OTPs. Phase II’s three aims compare Sonara against usual take-homes in order to: 1) assess Sonara’s impact
on retention in care and opioid use, 2) evaluate the MBC tool (OC-VAS) integrated into Sonara, and 3) test
Sonara’s influence on patient, program and payer costs of care and patient health-related quality of life. The
proposed aims position the Sonara Platform to become a standard of care across OTPs that documents
appropriate use of take-home medication and informs better clinical decision-making. Wide adoption of the
Sonora Platform can expand access to OTP services for people seeking methadone treatment for severe OUD.
The Sonara Platform, moreover, supports the implementation of MBC for monitoring drug use disorders through
automated data collection via the app and pragmatic value (a measure of risk for return to use). Increased
patient-centered care (i.e., access to take-homes) improves retention in care, reduces medical transportation
costs, and enhances health-related quality of life."
10820974,"Project Summary/Abstract
LifeBio develops agetech for care management of people with dementia (PWD). In this proposed SBIR
Phase I, we will build out the prototype of LifeBioTALK, a tablet-based platform designed to provide
stimulating and engaging audiovisual content to PWD narrated by a human-like pre-scripted avatar. The
eventual vision for LifeBioTALK is to simulate natural conversation with an avatar narrating audiovisual
episodes with appropriate multimedia content with no need for a human behind the narration. Our work is
predicated on the idea that engaging with appropriate content with simulated human interaction may lessen
the impact of loneliness on the person with AD/ADRD. We anticipate a large commercial market in home
care settings as well as in residential care settings when caregivers are seeking a simple way to engage
PWD. In Phase I, LifeBio will design the LifeBioTALK prototype with six scripted 22-minute episodes
narrated by a human-looking “talking” avatar. The MVP will have the ability to record video and audio
responses from participants and will use the iPad’s built-in TrueDepth camera to collect participant
response data to conduct preliminary objective assessments of engagement with the LifeBioTALK content.
LifeBio will elicit user feedback to finalize a usable prototype. In Aim 2, our collaborators at Brown
University Division of Geriatrics will conduct a fidelity trial with 35 dyads (a person with dementia and
their care partner) to evaluate acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of LifeBioTALK for PWD.
Caregivers will set up the tablet and PWD will watch six 22-minute LifeBioTALK episodes (2 a day x 3
days). The caregiver and PWD will complete the system usability scale (SUS). Feasibility will be
determined by usability scores of >30 (out of 50) on the SUS. Participants will also complete open-ended
feedback questions about the product. Our long-term vision for LifeBioTALK in Phase II is that the
platform will have individualized and varied content that objectively engages the PWD. The fully built out
LifeBioTALK (in a future Phase II) will ‘learn’ to detect when users like or dislike content based on AI/ML
that integrates facial imaging detection. We anticipate that PWD using LifeBioTALK will have a reduction
in challenging behaviors because the experience with the product will promote mental stimulation and
enjoyment and reduce feelings of loneliness. We anticipate the product will lessen caregiver burden by
offering periods of respite while the PWD is engaged with tailored, customized content in Phase II.
Importantly, to promote commercialization of the LifeBio suite of products, the LifeBioTALK will leverage
our NIA SBIR-funded LifeBioMEMORY life story app technology to gather the background, story, and
care preferences stored in LifeBio’s database to expedite customization of LifeBioTALK episodes in Phase
II. We anticipate that this will be a competitive market solution to the well-established finding that social
isolation, loneliness, and challenging behaviors, nearly unavoidable sequelae of AD and ADRD, are the
main drivers of poor quality of life for both the PWD and the caregiver."
10821247,"1 Abstract: Immertec's proprietary technology for streaming stereoscopic video along with timely
 2 biomedical feeds is accelerating the translation of specialty knowledge to medical practice across
 3 distances. Due to geographic and financial barriers, patients in underserved rural areas often lack
 4 access to healthcare specialists or advanced medical equipment. To meet the need for specialty
 5 care, general practitioners in rural communities can be trained by specialists to manage high-risk
 6 medical emergencies or other procedures when specialists are not locally available. Training for rural
 7 clinicians often involves travel to in-person courses, which is a logistical burden that taxes a
 8 physician's time for patient care. Instead of traveling to onsite training, Immertec's technology
 9 provides a live, immersive, distance training option for clinicians, connecting specialists in academic
10 centers with rural healthcare providers to bring evidence-based best practices to rural communities
11 more quickly. Immertec's patented method for the selective transmission of media content is used to
12 stream stereoscopic video with more efficiency to remote locations, allowing for synchronous
13 communication across distances. This method of streaming provides remote physicians with
14 immersive video of live procedures, real-time views of critical medical feeds, and ability to train or
15 collaborate with distant specialists as if physically present. During the NIH SBIR Phase I effort,
16 Immertec's software and user interface were developed and tested with physicians. After
17 development, the usability of Immertec's VR system was validated by subject matter experts (i.e.,
18 attending physicians in Emergency Medicine [EM] and Obstetrics) who rated the technology an “A+”
19 grade on an industry benchmark usability scale. Following the confirmation of usability, EM resident
20 physicians were trained to manage an obstetrical emergency using Immertec's system. Phase II
21 expands on the previous effort through integration of additional VR-enabled features and
22 implementing Immertec's technology at a rural physician training program. In collaboration with the
23 University of South Florida's (USF) Center for Advanced Medical Learning and Simulation (CAMLS),
24 Immertec's technology will be used to provide distance simulation training for two obstetrical
25 emergencies to a rural medical residency program. Results of the training will be compared to in-
26 person training at a second rural medical residency program (control group) comparing outcome
27 measures (i.e., knowledge, performance, confidence), setup cost, and participant time for rural

10821673,"KDH Research & Communication (KDHRC) proposes to develop and evaluate Effective
Newborn Community-Outreach Recovery Engagement (ENCORE), which will train community
health workers (CHW) to support postpartum Black Indigenous and People of Color (BIPOC)
women. ENCORE-trained CHWs will conduct outreach to postpartum BIPOC women,
particularly women who no longer receive care from doulas and midwives (birth workers), filling
a gap in critical postpartum time and providing a seamless transition in care for women.
 Maternal complications are more common in BIPOC populations than in White populations.
And although many BIPOC women receive care from birth workers, BIPOC women still need
support after the woman no longer receives support from the birth workers. Indeed, postpartum
mothers often experience a gap in care in care during the critical postpartum period.
 CHWs are ideally positioned to fill this gap and educate and support postpartum BIPOC
women due to deeply established connections to their communities and the proven effectiveness
of CHW outreach for positive behavior change, including reaching women with health-changing
information and skills-development. Therefore, ENCORE will train CHWs to conduct effective
outreach to postpartum BIPOC women, supporting women to navigate barriers to health care
and implement strategies to improve their mental and physical health.
 The ENCORE prototype will consist of the introduction and two full online course lessons with
text, animatics, and rough-cut interactive learning experiences. In Phase I, we will develop the
ENCORE prototype with feedback from an advisory committee in alignment with CHW best
practices, the needs of postpartum BIPOC women, and scientifically accurate information. We
will evaluate the ENCORE prototype in a randomized, two-group study that empirically assesses
knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy among CHWs to provide support to postpartum women after
prototype exposure. The Phase I project will prepare us for Phase II expansion and a rigorous
randomized controlled trial of the impact of CHW outreach on postpartum BIPOC women.
When complete, ENCORE will be marketed through KDHRC's robust sales system that uses
email and interpersonal outreach to promote and support adoption of our suite of
CHW/promotores training programs. ENCORE is innovative because it will reach an
underserved, at-need population with a culturally competent intervention that will support, fill
the gap in care for, and ultimately improve quality of life among postpartum BIPOC women."

Dr. Jay’s long-term career goal is to become a leading independent investigator whose research contributes to
the elimination of racial/ethnic disparities in firearm violence, with a focus on city-dwelling youth. Most firearm
violence occurs in cities, where Black youth are 20 times more likely, and Hispanic youth are 4.4 times more
likely, to be fatally shot than non-Hispanic White youth at ages 18-24. The overarching goal of Dr. Jay’s
research project is to identify optimal strategies for reducing racial/ethnic disparities in youth firearm injuries in
cities. Specifically, this K01 tests whether disparities in youth firearm injuries can be reduced by bolstering
individual-level programs with two related interventions: (a) Desegregation policies, i.e., changing public policy
to decrease racial segregation across neighborhoods, and (b) Physical investments, i.e., improving the built
environment in disinvested areas. Dr. Jay will assess disinvestment as a pathway linking segregation with
youth firearm injury disparities (Aim 1); conduct participatory mapping with racial/ethnic minority youth in
Boston, MA to identify novel targets for physical investments (Aim 2); and test possible intervention strategies
in a computer-simulated environment to determine which strategies produce the greatest reductions in youth
firearm injury disparities, within realistic budgetary constraints (Aim 3).
The proposed research builds upon Dr. Jay’s prior research on place-based interventions for violence
prevention and his postdoctoral training in youth firearm injury and computational epidemiology. He will pursue
the following K01 training goals to prepare him for the proposed research and for his career goals: (1)
Structural racism and discrimination as drivers of health disparities; (2) Community-engaged research; (3)
Computer simulation modeling; and (4) Economic evaluation. Dr. Jay has assembled a mentorship team led by
his primary mentor, Dr. Emily Rothman, Professor of Community Health Sciences at Boston University School
of Public Health (BUSPH). Co-mentors include Dr. David Williams, the Chair of Social and Behavioral Sciences
at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH); Dr. Melissa Tracy, Associate Professor of
Epidemiology and Biostatistics at SUNY-Albany; Dr. Ankur Pandya, Associate Professor of Health Decision
Science at HSPH. Advisors are Dr. Sandro Galea, the Dean and Robert A. Knox Professor at BUSPH and Dr.
Charles Branas, the Chair of Epidemiology at the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. The resources
available at BUSPH, coupled with the expertise of Dr. Jay’s mentorship team, will ensure Dr. Jay’s successful
completion of the research and training aims and his development as an independent investigator."
10808125,"In order to evade host immunity, many bacteria secrete immunomodulatory enzymes. Streptococcus
pyogenes, one of the most common human pathogens, secretes unique endoglycosidases, including EndoS,
which removes complex-type glycans in a highly specific manner from human IgG antibodies, and its homolog
EndoS2, which can additionally remove IgG-linked high-mannose glycans. This renders antibodies incapable
of eliciting host effector functions through either complement or Fc γ receptors (FcγRs), providing the bacteria
with a survival advantage. Because antibodies are central players in many human immune responses and
bridge the innate and adaptive arms of immunity, the analysis and manipulation of the enzymatic activities of
EndoS and EndoS2 impact diverse fields in biomedicine. In particular, modifying antibody glycan structures
can have significant impacts on their abilities to bind to FcγRs and the subsequent immune system reactions
that they induce. The next generation of therapeutic antibodies is already being constructed with modified
glycan chemistries to tailor their immune reactions and to increase their clinical potency. EndoS and EndoS2,
as antibody-specific glycosidases, and glycosynthases derived thereof, are key enzymes in the future of
antibody engineering. We propose that if the molecular mechanisms by which diverse endoglycosidases
specifically recognize and hydrolyze distinct glycoprotein substrates are better understood that EndoS and
EndoS2 variants can be rationally engineered to create a new class of antibody-modifying enzymes endowed
with unique glycan specificities in order to modify antibodies that exhibit enhanced clinical properties. In this
proposal, we will address three Specific Aims: (1) to determine the molecular basis of glycan specificity by
endoglycosidases; (2) to define the role of carbohydrate binding modules – non-enzymatic protein domains
with glycan binding properties – in endoglycosidase specificity and activity; and (3) to elucidate the molecular
basis of protein specificity by endoglycosidases. Progress towards these complementary, yet independent,
Specific Aims will significantly advance our understanding of glycan-modifying enzymes. Leveraging this
knowledge in the context of EndoS and EndoS2 will enhance our ability to customize antibodies, further
unleashing their vast therapeutic utility and expanding their positive impact on human health."

Nearly half of sexual minority (SM) men experience adult sexual assault (ASA) victimization (e.g., sexual
coercion, rape) in their lifetime, and as many as 30% of SM men report lifetime ASA perpetration. Rates of
ASA victimization and perpetration among SM men are alarmingly high even when measured over short
periods of time. However, little research has examined risk and protective factors for ASA victimization or
perpetration among SM men. Research that does exist is mostly cross-sectional or focuses on sexual IPV
rather than ASA across a broad range of perpetrator–victim relationships (e.g., acquaintance, established
partner). The lack of research on ASA among SM men precludes researchers and practitioners from
developing risk reduction and prevention programming specifically for this population. There is also a dearth of
research on factors that predict outcomes associated with ASA victimization among SM men, information that
is sorely needed to create affirming interventions for SM men who experience ASA victimization. The purpose
of the proposed study is to utilize a longitudinal, prospective design to test three innovative models that include
established (e.g., child sexual abuse, heavy episodic drinking), as well as population-specific (e.g., internalized
homonegativity, LGBTQ+ sense of community), risk and protective factors to predict experiences of ASA
perpetration among SM men (Aim 1); experiences of ASA victimization among SM men (Aim 2); and adverse

We focus on young adult SM men (ages 18 to 30) given that rates of ASA are
highest among this population and primary prevention of ASA is of paramount importance. We will also include
SM men regardless of their relationship status since ASA can occur in various types of relationships (e.g.,
serious relationship, friends with benefits, acquaintances) and less commonly among strangers. The
methodology includes recruiting a geographically and racially diverse sample of SM men (N = 3,600) via

This proposed project aligns with NIMHD’s research priorities to advance the
scientific understanding of health disparities and improve minority health. Moreover, the proposed project will
provide critically important information that will inform the immediate development of affirming and culturally
grounded prevention programs (to reduce ASA perpetration), risk reduction programs (to reduce ASA
victimization), and intervention initiatives (to reduce adverse outcomes associated with ASA victimization)."
10806316,"This K08 proposal will complete Dr. Wajd Al-Holou’s training towards his long-term career goal of directing an
independent research program that aims to define critical cellular interactions in the tumor microenvironment
that drive treatment resistance in glioblastoma (GBM) and ultimately identify therapies targeting mechanisms of
resistance. Dr. Al-Holou is an assistant professor in the department of Neurosurgery at the University of
Michigan with established success in the field of neurosurgical oncology who completed his clinical training at
the University of Michigan and MD Anderson Cancer Center. This proposal builds on Dr. Al-Holou’s previously
acquired expertise in tumor biology and the development and analysis of recurrence models in GBM and
proposes further training in defining tumor microenvironmental interactions utilizing in vitro and in vivo
modeling, cancer genomics and bioinformatics, cancer biology, research ethics, grant writing and biostatistics,
by means of investigative research and formal course work. Dr. Maria Castro, an internationally recognized
expert on glioma tumor biology and the tumor microenvironment (TME) with a strong record of training
scientists, will serve as primary mentor. Dr. Pedro Lowenstein, renowned for his work in vivo modeling and the
development of novel therapies for GBM, and Dr. Thomas Wilson, an expert in the utilization of advanced
genomics to answer critical biological questions, will serve as co-mentors and have a long track record of
mentoring success. The University of Michigan has a rich and collaborative environment, and a strong
institutional commitment to its trainees. This 5-year plan includes formal coursework, professional development
and progressively independent research, with defined milestones to ensure productivity and a successful
transition to independence.
GBM is a lethal disease with therapeutic resistance that is driven by marked heterogeneity within the tumor
microenvironment. The goal of this research is to elucidate critical TME interactions and cellular crosstalk that
drive inherently resistant GBM cells to recur following therapy. We previously identified a rare population of
inherently resistant THY1+ tumor cells in treatment naïve tumors that recurred following therapy. These cells
show evidence of important cell signaling in the TME, exhibit a mesenchymal and stem-like phenotype, and
are co-localize with macrophages in the perivascular niche. We hypothesize that THY1-mediated resistance
results from cellular interactions in the TME, especially with macrophages, driving recurrence. To test this
hypothesis, we have designed in vitro/in vivo analyses combined with spatial single cell analyses of human
GBM to unravel how cell interactions in the TME drive resistance in hopes that inhibiting these interactions will
abrogate treatment resistance. In total, this work will provide a foundation upon which Dr. Al-Holou will build a
career investigating the intersection of resistant cell populations, cell signaling and TME interactions, and
pathways to resistance to ultimately advance new targeted therapies to improve patient outcomes."
10809758,"Adversarially Based Virtual CT Workflow for Evaluation of AI in Medical Imaging
ABSTRACT
Over the past several years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), especially deep learning (DL),
has been the most prominent direction of tomographic research, commercial development, clinical translation,
and FDA evaluation. Recently, it has become widely recognized that deep neural networks often have
generalizability issues and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, deliberate or unintentional. This critical
challenge must be addressed to optimize the performance of deep neural networks in medical applications.
In January this year, FDA published an action plan for furthering the oversight for AI/DL-based software as
medical devices (SaMDs). One major action underlined in the plan is “regulatory science methods related to
algorithm bias and robustness”. The significance of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of AI/DL-based
SaMDs cannot be overestimated since AI is expected to play a critical role in the future of medicine. In this
context, the overall goal of this academic-FDA partnership R01 project is to generate diverse training and
challenging testing datasets of low-dose CT (LDCT) scans, prototype a virtual CT workflow, and establish an
evaluation methodology for AI-based imaging products to support FDA marketing authorization. The technical
innovation lies in cutting-edge DL methods empowered by (a) adversarial learning to generate anatomically
and pathologically representative features in the human chest; (b) adversarial attacking to probe the virtual CT
workflow in individual steps and its entirety; and (c) systematic evaluation methods to better characterize and
predict the clinical performance of AI-based imaging products. In contrast to other CT simulation pipelines, our
Adversarially Based CT (ABC) platform relies on adversarial learning to ensure diversity and realism of the
simulated data and images and improve the generalizability of deep networks, and utilizes adversarial samples
to probe the ABC workflow to address the robustness of deep networks.
The overarching hypothesis is that adversarial learning and attacking methods are powerful to deliver high-
quality datasets for AI-based imaging research and performance evaluation. The specific aims are: (1) diverse
patient modeling (SBU), (2) virtual CT scanning (UTSW), (3) deep CT imaging (RPI), (4) virtual workflow
validation (FDA), and (5) ABC system dissemination (RPI-SBU-UTSW-FDA). In this project, generative
adversarial learning will play an instrumental role in generating features of clinical semantics. Also, adversarial
samples will be produced in both sinogram and image domains. In these complementary ways, AI-based
imaging products can be efficiently evaluated for not only accuracy but also generalizability and robustness.
Upon completion, our ABC workflow/platform will be made publicly available and readily extendable to other
imaging modalities and other diseases. This ABC system will be shared through the FDA’s Catalog of
Regulatory Science Tools, and uniquely well positioned to greatly facilitate the development, assessment and
translation of emerging AI-based imaging products."

Our long-term goal is to identify therapeutic agents that can prevent the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). The number of AD cases is rising dramatically worldwide, and there is an urgent need to develop new
therapies that are more efficacious than the four currently approved drugs for AD which provide only modest
symptomatic relief. Every clinical trial to date has failed to demonstrate disease-modifying efficacy for AD, which
may in part be due to our limited understanding of the mechanisms that precede the pathogenesis of AD, and
that are distinct from normal healthy aging. The overall aims of our proposal are to further understand the
mechanisms underlying dysregulation of the autophagy-inflammation network that becomes progressively
dysregulated with age, and accelerated by pathological conditions. Systemic inflammation is a biomarker of this
dysregulation, as exemplified by its prevalence in many aging-related disorders including cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, cancers, and neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative disorders such Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We
hypothesize that mechanisms which drive systemic inflammation are common to both the biology of aging and
AD and propose that interventions which target the shared feature of systemic inflammation, via regulation of
the autophagy-inflammation network, may have potential as therapeutic agents for the prevention of conversion
to disease pathogenesis in AD, as well as improve healthspan and longevity in aging populations. For this
proposal we will use a combination of genetic and pharmacological tools to understand which brain specific cell
types may be involved in the regulation of the autophagy-inflammation network via both mTOR dependent and
mTOR-independent mechanisms that modulate inflammation. Findings from our studies will provide mechanistic
insights at a cellular level and innovative therapeutic strategies for further research. Specifically, we will
investigate the individual cell types that contribute to the neuroprotective effects of mTOR inhibition in
progressive AD, and confirm and extend the data on the beneficial effects of lifespan and healthspan in sporadic
AD with prophylactic treatment of rapamycin. Critically, since age and genetics are the leading risk factors for
AD, we will evaluate interventions in preclinical model systems that incorporate both aging and genetic risk
factors for AD. We will therefore test the role of direct manipulation of AMPK on modulation of lifespan and
healthspan in normal aging and in AD susceptible models, and the beneficial role of MAG lipase inhibition in
normal healthy aging and in the pathogenesis of AD in comparison to the effects of rapamycin in a mouse model
of late onset AD."
10809643,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 High rates of opioid-related mortality have led to clinical and governmental policies, including guidelines
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommending decreased use of opioids. A safety
concern is that these policies have led some physicians to discontinue prescribing long-term opioid therapy
(LTOT) abruptly or without support for patients, which could drive some patients to use illicit opioids or to
commit suicide. Of note, rates of overdose and opioid-related deaths have not decreased significantly despite
reduced use of opioids. No study to our knowledge has evaluated patient experiences when LTOT is
discontinued by the prescribing provider.
 The proposed study addresses this critical gap in our understanding of patient and provider experiences,
strategies, and decisions when faced with provider-initiated LTOT discontinuation. The study will address this
gap by conducting in-depth, qualitative interviews with patients who have recently discontinued LTOT and
providers who discontinued LTOT prescriptions to achieve the following aims: 1) To assess patient and
provider experiences and needs when providers initiate discontinuation of LTOT; 2) To develop a patient
decision aid (DA) to support patients when discontinuing LTOT; 3) To pilot test the DA with patients.
 The proposed study will be conducted in two states with diverse policies and prescribing environments for
LTOT—Washington and Arkansas. For Aim 1, qualitative interviews will be conducted with 100 patients (50 per
site) whose providers have initiated discussions that lead to LTOT discontinuation and 30 providers (15 per
site) who discontinued LTOT for their patients. For Aim 2, a patient DA for discontinuing LTOT will be
developed, consistent with international patient DA standards, building on findings from the Aim 1 qualitative
research. Aim 3 will be a pilot test of the DA in which patients complete surveys before and after they review
the DA and have a conversation about it with a study interventionist. The surveys will assess implementation
feasibility, acceptability, knowledge transfer, decisional conflict, quality of the conversation generated by the
DA and patient intent to follow up with their primary care provider.
 Public Health Impact. With prescribers now encouraged to stop prescribing opioids, impacts to patients
who have LTOT discontinued include unsafe withdrawal experiences, feeling compelled to seek out riskier
sources of opioids (including deadly fentanyl), and increased risk of suicide. The proposed study addresses
critical gaps in knowledge and resources to improve patient-centered care and shared decision making when
LTOT is discontinued. The DA will improve patient engagement around key decisions such as speed of taper,
management of withdrawal symptoms, alternative pain and symptom management, as well as OUD
assessment and treatment options. In the long-term, the DA will improve safety and outcomes for patients by
ensuring they get the support they need to successfully discontinue LTOT."

Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) encode everything an animal hears and send this information to the brain. In
order to achieve rapid and reliable signal transmission, SGNs exhibit a number of specialized properties,
including the ability to respond to glutamate via large, AMPA-receptor rich post-synaptic densities. Although all
SGNs are glutamatergic, differences in the nature of their synapses and their responses to sound indicate that
there are three distinct subtypes. High spontaneous firing rate (SR) SGNs have low thresholds and are likely the
first to respond to sound. Low SR SGNs have higher thresholds and are proposed to improve the ability to detect
sounds in noise; medium SR SGNs fall in between. These physiological differences are accompanied by parallel
changes in the abundance of AMPA receptors and the size of the opposing pre-synaptic ribbon. Low SR SGN
synapses are more vulnerable to the effects of noise exposure, which may be why some people have trouble
understanding what they hear despite normal auditory thresholds. The long term goal of this project is to
understand how SGNs acquire the properties needed for the perception of sound. More immediately, we will
define the intrinsic transcriptional networks that endow SGN subtypes with their distinct properties and functions.
We hypothesize that SGN diversification depends on the combined activities of a pan-SGN Gata3 network and
a subtype-specific program driven by the transcription factor Runx1. Previously, we showed that Gata3
influences multiple features of SGN differentiation, acting in part through the transcription factor Mafb (Lu et al.,
2011; Appler et al., 2013; Yu et al., 2013). In Mafb mutant mice, SGNs do not develop normal post-synaptic
densities. Subsequently, we showed that Type I SGNs fall into three molecular distinct subtypes (Ia, Ib, and Ic)
that match the features of high, medium, and low SR SGNs respectively (Shrestha et al., 2018). New preliminary
studies suggest that diversification among Type I SGNs requires the transcription factor Runx1, which is
restricted to Ib and Ic subtypes by late embryogenesis and then maintained throughout life. Further, Ic SGNs
appear to be lost from Runx1 conditional knock-out (CKO) mice, as indicated by changes in gene expression
and altered ABR responses. Here, we will define the role of Runx1 and its relationship with Gata3. We will
perform a thorough analysis of Runx1CKO mice, examining SGN composition, synaptic heterogeneity, and the
effects on hearing. In parallel, we will use genetic and viral overexpression approaches to learn how Gata3 and
its Maf effectors influence the emergence of subtype identity and synaptic heterogeneity in vivo. Using single
cell and bulk RNA-sequencing, we will define the molecular programs active in developing Ib/c SGNs and test
how these programs are altered by loss of Runx1 or Gata3, as well as how the Maf factors contribute. These
studies will elucidate the molecular programs driving SGN diversification, show how this diversity influences
hearing, and may reveal a way to replace lost Ic SGNs and hence restore normal hearing after acoustic trauma."

The goal of this competing renewal is to evaluate impacts of two `naturally occurring' interventions -
community empowerment (CE) and changes in policing practices - on incidence of HIV/STIs, overdose (OD),
and engagement with addiction services among street and indoor sex workers (SWs) in an urban Canadian
setting. Currently, there is a lack of research on integrated interventions to address co-occurring harms related
to HIV/STI and overdose epidemics, particularly among sex workers, who face disproportionate HIV and STI
burdens and severe gaps in access to evidence-based addiction services. While structural and system-level
interventions such as CE and changes in policing practices have strong potential to mitigate harms associated
with overlapping HIV/STI and overdose epidemics, there remains a scarcity of data on how the implementation
of such interventions impacts HIV/STI and overdose incidence and engagement with addiction services among
sex workers. Beginning in 2018, a novel CE intervention was launched in Metro Vancouver, British Columbia
comprised of: peer navigation; peer-delivered naloxone and point-of-care (POC) HIV/STI screening; and
system-level healthcare provider sensitivity training. In response to high rates of violence against SWs and SW
advocacy efforts, two Metro Vancouver policing jurisdictions are currently implementing new guidelines for
non-harassment and arrest of SWs. Both `naturally occurring' structural and system-level interventions provide
a timely opportunity to evaluate their individual and combined effects. Through an R01, our team has recruited
and followed a cohort of >800 street and off-street women SWs in Metro Vancouver since 2010, among whom
incidence of HIV/STIs and non-fatal OD remain alarmingly high. We propose to take advantage of the rare
opportunity to evaluate `naturally-occurring' CE and local policing interventions by addressing the following
aims prospectively amongst SWs in Metro Vancouver: (1) Examine the effects of a combination CE
intervention on HIV/STI and OD incidence and engagement with OD prevention and services; (2) Evaluate the
feasibility, acceptability, and implementation of peer-based HIV/STI point-of-care (POC) screening on HIV/STI
incidence and linkage to addiction treatment; (3) Measure impacts of new police enforcement practices on use
of addiction services and incidence of HIV/STIs and overdose, including potential differences pre/post CE
implementation; (4) Evaluate combined effects of exposure to structural and system-level CE and policing
interventions on HIV/STI and OD incidence. To achieve these aims, we will continue to follow and replenish the
AESHA cohort of 800 HIV-seronegative women SWs, which is the only ongoing longitudinal SW cohort in
North America. Data collection will include semi-annual questionnaires, HIV/STI serology, and administrative
linkages to external policing and mortality databases. Amidst syndemics of HIV/STIs, opioid use, and OD
among SWs and PWUD in North America, this study will inform combination interventions to reduce the
incidence of HIV/STIs and OD amongst marginalized populations."

The overarching goal of our proposed research program is to develop a discovery pipeline that will enable
identification of transcriptional codes for engineering tissue-specific endothelial cells (ECs) for therapeutic
organ regeneration of heart, lung and blood. Therapies for organ regeneration promises unlimited access to
the replacement tissues. However, despite breakthroughs in uncovering the molecular underpinnings of organ
morphogenesis and organoid technology, translation of regenerative medicine to the clinic has confronted with
hurdles. These bottlenecks are in part due to the lack of understanding as to how niche cells coordinate organ
repair. Specifically, contribution of vascular niche cells that supply regenerative signals has not been realized.
This R35 application builds upon the novel proposition that poor healing after organ damage is due to the
dysfunction and loss of the tissue-specific ECs. This programmatic proposal examines the hypothesis that
reconstitution of stem cells in injured organs is dependent on the pro-regenerative angiocrine signals supplied
by tissue-specific vascular niche ECs. We have shown that organotypic ECs by deploying defined angiocrine
factors support lung, cardiac, hepatic and hematopoietic regeneration. Thus, ECs perform actively as dynamic,
tissue-specified niche cells critical for tissue homeostasis and repair. To test this and to set up the stage for
therapies, we have engineered adaptable mouse, nonhuman primate and human ECs by transducing the
transduction factor (TF) ETV2 into adult mature ECs (R-VECs) and differentiating human induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) into generic fetal-like ECs (iVECs) that could inform on the pathways that induce
organotypic TFs. These adaptive iVECs and R-VECs will be cocultured with heart, lung, and blood organoids
in vitro or infused in vivo in mice undergoing organ repair to identify the induction of organotypic TFs in these
cells. The educated iVECs and R-VECs will be recovered and subjected to RNA profiling and de novo motif
discovery to identify induced tissue-specific TF(s). The identified TFs will be overexpressed or knocked down
in ECs, to validate their function in sustaining organotypic and angiocrine profile for organ repair. We anticipate
that transplantation of organotypic ECs will promote long-lasting tissue repair without provoking tumorigenesis
or fibrosis. We have initiated FDA-approved human clinical trials to examine the safety and efficacy of
allogeneic generic EC infusion for hematopoietic recovery. As a follow up, we intend to assess the contribution
of R-VECs or iVECs-derived from nonhuman primates to regeneration in the pigtail macaque monkeys with the
intention of translating the potential of organotypic ECs to clinic. The expected outcomes of the proposed
research are identification of molecular signals and transcriptional determinants of tissue-specific vascular and
angiocrine heterogeneity. Goals of this proposal fit with the mission of NHLBI R35 award to develop innovative
regenerative discovery pipeline to promote safe and efficacious treatments for cardiac, pulmonary and blood
maladies."

Obesity is a chronic, relapsing, and multifactorial disease,[1] with a prevalence of 42%.[2] As with any obesity treatment, the weight loss response with anti-obesity medications (AOMs) is highly variable. For example, semaglutide 2.4 mg, the most effective AOM leads to a mean total body weight loss (TBWL) of 15% in randomized clinical trials[3] and in real-world clinic cohort studies.[4] However, only 50% of participants achieve >15% in one year,[3] whereas 30% lose less than 10% TBWL. In the clinical practice, access to AOMs can be limited by their high cost. Importantly, given the variable weight loss response to AOM, these may not be cost-effective, particularly in poor responders who will not only incur unnecessary high costs, but will also be exposed to possible side effects. Currently, besides identifying responders by trial-and-error,[5, 6] little is known about the predictors of response to AOM, and the heterogeneous response to this type of intervention, remains an important challenge in clinical practice.[1, 7] There is a critical need to identify the predictors of response to AOM to develop individualized weight-loss strategies that enhance weight loss outcomes in people with obesity.[8] 
Our team focuses on understanding the heterogeneity of human obesity by identifying predictors of response to weight loss treatments.[9] Phenotyping of 880 adults has demonstrated that there are phenotypic traits that differentially respond to weight loss interventions. One of these phenotypic traits is abnormal postprandial satiety.[10] Patients with abnormal postprandial satiety have increased postprandial hunger, which is associated with accelerated gastric emptying.[11] To date, we have shown that lifestyle interventions, AOMs, and endoscopic devices targeting this underlying phenotypic trait enhance weight loss outcomes in patients with obesity.[10, 12-20] Our data suggest that the phenotype-tailored approach could become a clinical approach for the treatment of obesity, whereby individual patients are matched to treatments directed at the underlying phenotype. However, the current methods used to identify phenotypes are time-consuming, invasive, expensive, limited to a few academic centers, and not generally accessible for most patients. 
To address these limitations, an academic-industry partnership was established, and we have developed and validated a novel blood- and saliva-based biomarker test of appetite regulation in obesity that predicts the abnormal postprandial satiety phenotype. The current biomarker, named MyPhenomeTM test, is ready for commercialization in a CLIA-CAP accredited laboratory; and it will be scalable and affordable to support healthcare providers to guide patients to tailored anti-obesity treatments. Our aim is to study, in a multi-center, 24-week, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the efficacy of subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in patients with obesity with either a positive or a negative MyPhenome test for abnormal postprandial satiety. This step is essential in the final validation process of this novel biomarker prior to seeking third party reimbursement for its use to guide therapy for obesity."

sufficient and necessary to prevent TGFb1-­induced fibrosis. Thus, we hypothesized that EPA-­Ffar4 signaling is 
necessary for EPA cardioprotection. However, we were surprised to find that Ffar4 also has w3-­independent 
effects. In mice with systemic deletion of Ffar4 (Ffar4KO) on a standard diet, we found that TAC worsens 
remodeling, but without exaggerated fibrosis, highlighting the role of Ffar4 in cardiac myocytes. In myocytes, 
we found that Ffar4 was necessary for the expression of cardioprotective inflammatory genes and activation of 
phospholipase A2 (PLA2). In humans, we found that Ffar4 expression is decreased in human HF, and Ffar4 
polymorphisms are associated with contractile dysfunction in Framingham Offspring. Here, we propose a novel 
paradigm where fatty acids function as signaling molecules to maintain cardiac homeostasis. We hypothesize 
that in cardiac myocytes, Ffar4 functions as an w3-­independent cardioprotective, fatty acid nutrient sensor, and 
that Ffar4 is necessary for EPA cardioprotection. We propose four aims. 1) To determine if cardiac myocyte 
Ffar4 is necessary to protect against ischemia, cardiac myocyte-­specific Ffar4KO mice (CM-­Ffar4KO) will be 
subjected to ischemia-­reperfusion (I/R) injury, and we hypothesize worse outcomes in the CM-­Ffar4KO. 2) To 
define cardioprotective Ffar4 signaling mechanisms, following I/R injury in CM-­Ffar4KO mice and in hypoxia in 
cultured myocytes, we will measure cell death, inflammatory cytokines, PLA2-­induced oxylipins, and how this 
affects macrophage recruitment. 3) To determine if Ffar4 is necessary for EPA cardioprotection, CM-­Ffar4KO 
on an EPA-­diet will be subjected to I/R injury, and we hypothesize EPA will fail to attenuate remodeling in the 
CM-­Ffar4KO. 4) To determine the therapeutic potential of Ffar4, wild-­type mice subjected to I/R injury will 
treated with the Ffar4 agonist TUG-­891 post-­MI. In humans, we will test for associations between Ffar4

10800703,"Project Summary/Abstract
Insulin resistance (IR) is central to the development of type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia; however, there is no
single phenotype of the insulin resistant patient. This phenotypic heterogeneity is reflected in clinical practice as
variable manifestations of metabolic disease and variable response to both glucose lowering and triglyceride
lowering agents (such as fibrates and fish oil). A precision medicine approach, wherein an understanding of the
heterogeneity of disease is leveraged to target therapies to an individual patient’s pathology, requires an
understanding of this heterogeneity of disease. Notably, among equally obese patients, some are globally insulin
resistant, others insulin sensitive, and some demonstrate tissue specific IR. Thus, the mechanisms driving
increased triglyceride production an any particular patient may depend on the patient’s pattern of tissue specific
insulin resistance, with de novo lipogenesis predominating in the setting of skeletal muscle insulin resistance,
and esterification of preformed fatty acids predominating in the setting of adipose insulin resistance.
The overarching aim of this proposal is to build a mechanistic knowledge base to identify and optimize therapy
for discrete subgroups of IR. To achieve this goal, Dr. Vatner aims to: 1) elucidate the pathways that support
hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL) in rodent models of hepatic insulin resistance; 2) quantify the discrete
pathways by which adipose and muscle insulin resistance promote hepatic triglyceride production; and 3) assess
how differences in adipose and muscle insulin resistance in humans impact on the mechanisms underlying
hepatic triglyceride synthesis.
To achieve these goals, studies in both rodents and humans will be critical. Rodent models that exhibit different
tissue specific patterns of insulin resistance will be used, including high fat diet fed mice, insulin receptor T1160A
mutant mice, Tbc1d4p.Arg684Ter mutant mice, Mkr mice (mice with skeletal muscle specific resistance to insulin and
IGF1), and adipose Pde3b knockout mice. Human subjects with different patterns of tissue specific insulin
resistance will be studied. Stable isotope tracer techniques will be used to assess contributions of de novo
lipogenesis and esterification of preformed fatty acids to triglyceride synthesis. Standard and cutting-edge
molecular biology tools, including chromatin immunoprecipitation, quantitative PCR, RNA-Seq, and
immunoblotting, will be used to delineate the molecular pathways playing key roles in the regulation of hepatic
triglyceride production. The key subject of interest in this proposal is the clinical heterogeneity of
hypertriglyceridemia in the setting of insulin resistance; studies using pharmacologic interventions (SGLT2
inhibition, inhibition of adipose lipolysis) and exercise interventions will directly address this clinical
heterogeneity."
10797837,"Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness and is projected to affect 112 million people worldwide
by 2040. Unfortunately, Veterans have a 2-fold higher prevalence of developing glaucoma compared to the
general US population. While the exact cause of glaucoma is unknown, recent evidence has shown that early
menopause, mutations in estrogen receptors, and polymorphism mutations along the estrogen metabolic
pathway are linked to developing glaucoma. These data highlight that menopause, and particularly estrogen,
may play a role in the development of this disease. However, there is a gap in our knowledge of quantifying if
menopause, regardless of age, is related to the onset of glaucoma. It is vital to understand this relationship, as
59% of the glaucomatous population are women and the number of female Veterans has doubled over the last
ten years. In addition, nearly 43% of female Veterans are younger than 45 years old and will experience
menopause (average age at 51 years) within the next decade. The evidence of 1) a higher prevalence of
glaucoma in Veterans, 2) the increasing number of female Veterans, and 3) the aging of female Veterans will
make glaucoma a major health issue in the future for this population. The VA formed the Women’s Veterans
Health Research Network (WVHRN) to help focus attention on research and treatments for this portion of the
Veteran population, and this proposal aims to understand the association between menopause, a major life event
for women, and glaucoma.
In this proposal, we hypothesize that menopause is related to the onset of glaucoma and will use the power
of the national VA database to perform a retrospective study to address this hypothesis. We will examine medical
records from female U.S. Veterans in the corporate data warehouse (VINCI – VA Informatics and Computing
Infrastructure) between 2000-2019. Previous studies summarized the impact of age of menopause on
developing glaucoma in the general population. However, this has not been confirmed in the Veteran population
where glaucoma is more prevalent. In addition, no study has directly assessed whether there is a direct
relationship between menopause and the onset of glaucoma. The VA database is a unique resource that can
provide longitudinal care records of patients that will allow us to understand the relationship between the onset
of menopause and glaucoma and the overall incidence of glaucoma in female and male Veterans.
Although glaucoma can occur at any level of intraocular pressure (IOP), elevated IOP remains clinically relevant
as a major causal risk factor for developing this disease. Several studies have shown that postmenopausal
women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) containing estrogen had a lower IOP compared to
postmenopausal women not taking HRT. This has led researchers to suggest that estrogen-based therapies
may be a potential treatment for glaucoma. Based on our work and others, we hypothesize that hormone
replacement therapy containing estrogen delays the onset of developing glaucoma in postmenopausal
women. This would provide evidence that estrogen is beneficial in protecting against the onset of glaucoma and
potentially lead to the development of estrogen-based treatments.
To address our hypotheses and research objectives, we have assembled a team consisting of Dr. Feola, who
has expertise in women’s health, menopause, and glaucoma, and a biostatistician in his laboratory. We also will
have guidance and input from a VA biostatistician (Dr. Cui) and an ophthalmologist (Dr. Giangiacomo). Our
proposal will evaluate the impact of menopause and HRT on developing glaucoma in female Veterans. Our goal
is to understand these relationships and communicate our findings with ophthalmology and the VA. Lastly, if
successful, our future studies aim to perform more prospective studies using the Technology-based Eye Care
Services (TECS) framework to screen female patients based on glaucoma and menopause status."
10913529,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for assessing treatment safety and efficacy and are the
primary evidence supporting FDA's regulatory decisions. However, RCTs have a number of limitations,
including the lack of generalizability of study findings and insufficient follow-up to assess long-term outcomes.
With the growing availability of disease modifying treatments (DMTs), novel approaches are needed to monitor
long-term safety and efficacy of agents used in chronic diseases. Electronic health record (EHR) data present
the opportunity to capture longitudinal treatment response in heterogeneous patient populations and real-world
settings and can be used to generate real-world evidence (RWE) to augment RCT data for these drugs.
However, availability of RWE for DMTs has been limited by the lack of computable information on disease
progression measures, which are the clinical outcomes monitored by physicians directing therapy. This
information is typically captured only in unstructured text during clinical visits and may also not be consistently
documented at every encounter, resulting in incomplete data even with labor-intensive manual abstraction.
Further, it is critical that RWE resources for robust post-market assessments of DMTs ensure reproducibility of
findings across healthcare systems. In this proposal, we address this unmet need by developing methods to
generate reproducible and generalizable RWE on unstructured efficacy and adverse event (AE) endpoints
used in the evaluation of therapies for rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis. We will create scalable
disease progression endpoints from EHR data by linking information in EHRs to registry data and building
algorithms for ordinal disease activity scores using features derived from scoring guidelines. In Aim 1, we
integrate disease activity and progression data from registries to generate scalable RWE on disease
progression endpoints leveraging structured and free-text EHR data. In Aim 2, we develop strategies to correct
for noise in medication prescriptions for DMTs in RWE studies. Aim 3 combines EHR data from multiple
healthcare systems through federated learning to ensure generalizability of RWE. We intend for the methods to
build new capabilities for use of RWE in FDA's regulatory decisions on drug effectiveness, providing an
efficient, scalable, and robust approach to using real-world clinical data to support approval of new drug
indications and conduct of postmarket studies for DMTs."
10800645,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health problem among US military service members and Veterans.
Although many with mild TBI will recover within 1-2 weeks, those with moderate to severe TBI as well as nearly
50% of those with mild TBI will have persistent symptoms lasting for months. Understanding the risk factors
involved in the persistent sequelae after TBI and the underlying molecular mechanisms will facilitate the
development of novel therapeutics. One potential factor recently identified in a study of US military service
members is pre-exposure to early stressful life experiences. Adverse childhood experiences are reported at
significantly higher levels among military personnel and Veterans than civilians. A key mechanism linking chronic
stress in early life to neurological problems in adulthood is immune dysregulation. Exposure to early life stress
(ELS) enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine release by microglia in response to a subsequent inflammatory
challenge. The goal of this proposal is to determine if ELS during development limits the recovery trajectory after
a TBI that occurs in adulthood. Using brief daily maternal separation in rat pups to model ELS, we have found
that ELS prior to TBI in adulthood increased interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels and expression of the NLRP3
inflammasome, which is a multi-protein complex that results in cleavage and activation of IL-1β. Exposure of
ELS prior to TBI also resulted in hippocampal atrophy, neuronal loss, and hippocampal-dependent learning
deficits. In contrast, TBI alone without stress or ELS in non-injured animals did not increase IL-1β levels, nor
were there observable learning deficits or pathology within the hippocampus. Treatment with an NLRP3
inflammasome inhibitor reversed these learning deficits and reduced hippocampal pathology and pro-
inflammatory cytokine expression. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that ELS limits the recovery after
TBI by increasing inflammatory signaling in microglia through the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to the
worsening of hippocampal pathology and the development of persistent learning and memory deficits. To test
this hypothesis, the following aims are proposed: 1) To determine if ELS prior to TBI experienced in adulthood
increases microglia activation, potentiates pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and activates the NLRP3
inflammasome, 2) To determine if ELS and TBI result in chronic behavioral problems and if these behavioral
deficits can be improved with an NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, and 3) To determine if ELS exacerbates
hippocampal neuronal and synaptic loss after TBI and if this can be reduced with an NLRP3 inflammasome
inhibitor. These studies will determine whether stress in early childhood is a predisposing factor for the
development of persistent neurological sequela after TBI. We will also test a promising therapeutic approach for
TBI, an NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor, to determine if this will reduce inflammation, prevent hippocampal
pathology and improve learning and memory after ELS and TBI."

Dr. Jerban is postdoctoral researcher with a multidisciplinary background who is proposing a research entitled
“Knee evaluation under mechanical loading by Cones Ultrashort Echo Time MR imaging” through NIH
K01 program under the mentorship of Drs. Christine Chung, Samuel Ward, and Jiang Du to develop into an
independent investigator. Improving the osteoarthritis (OA) diagnosis at early stage using Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) techniques are limited by three main barriers. First, the current clinical MRI techniques do not
acquire signal from short T2 tissues, such as the meniscus and the deep layer of cartilage. Second, most
Ultrashort Echo Time (UTE) MRI techniques that can acquire signal from short T2 tissues are orientation
sensitive. Third, knee MRI is routinely performed on joints at rest, which incompletely mimics the actual
physiological condition, particularly, the loading aspects. Recently, we have developed new UTE-MRI techniques
(UTE-Ad-T1ρ and UTE-MT) that are not orientation-sensitive and that are designed specifically for scanning short
T2 tissues of the knee. We have hypothesized that scanning knee joints during mechanical load application
using these orientation-insensitive techniques will reveal the mechanical properties of the joint tissues, which in
turn will help to distinguish between healthy, early stage and mild OA knee joints. We also hypothesized bone
remodels in order to enhance the support to cartilage/menisci regions with defected cartilage, which
complementarily confirms the early stage OA diagnosis. A research study is proposed to cover three main
specific aims: dissected specimens’ study, whole knee cadaveric study, and in vivo study. First, we will accelerate
the UTE-MRI techniques and then will investigate their variation patterns in healthy and moderate OA human
cartilage/menisci specimens during the loading/unloading process. We will also assess the supporting bone
specimens to compare with UTE variation patterns in cartilages/menisci under loading. Second, we will build and
verify a pneumatic loading setup for the cadaver whole knee study, which is meant to assess the temporal
variation of knees under a set of loading and unloading steps. Then the UTE-MRI variation patterns in joints from
healthy, mild OA, and moderate OA groups during the loading/unloading process will be investigated. Third, we
will design and build a separate loading device to perform the in vivo phase of the study. We will determine if in
vivo UTE-MRI variation pattern under loading are distinct for early stage OA patients, and if UTE-MRI/CT can
detect an improved bone structure and properties for early stage and mild OA knees. The feasibility of
accelerating our orientation-insensitive UTE-MRI techniques and the significant sensitivity of our techniques to
changes in knee tissues during mechanical load application (using an initial design of loading device) have been
demonstrated in our preliminary results. Dr. Jerban and his mentors, Drs. Chung, Ward, and Du, have designed
a detailed training plan and assembled a strong team of advisors to guide Dr. Jerban through his career
development plan towards becoming an independent investigator."
10800775,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
In 2015, Massachusetts General Hospital for Children (MGHfC) established the MGHfC Digestive Disease
Summer Research Program with the objective of providing short-term support for 10 undergraduate and/or
medical students to conduct mentor-supervised independent research in the setting of a research-oriented
teaching hospital. Students perform an independent research project focused on digestive diseases on a full-
time basis over a ten-week period during the summer months within a laboratory or collaborating laboratory of
MGHfC faculty. Collaborating laboratories of the MGHfC are laboratories within the Massachusetts General
Hospital (MGH) community that possess unique expertise in engineering and computational sciences currently
being leveraged to support various projects centered on digestive disease research. In addition to conducting
an independent project to be formally presented at a summer's end symposium, each student participates in a
peer-driven biomedical course entitled “Immunity, Microbes, & the Mucosa” as well as a panel discussion on
careers in biomedicine facilitated by faculty and biomedical professionals. Currently 22 MGH independent
investigators with interest in digestive diseases serve as mentors and have hosted students in their
laboratories since 2015. An advisory board that includes the program director, associate director, and a faculty
member is responsible for overseeing the program as well as recruiting and selecting participating students
each summer. The MGHfC Digestive Disease Summer Program has recruited approximately fifty students
from regions throughout the United States since its inception and this proposal seeks funding to support the
continuation of this program with the objective of recruiting and training at least fifty additional students over
the next five years. Several former students are of backgrounds under-represented in biomedical science
careers and strategies are in place to continue to recruit this vital cohort of future researchers into the field of
digestive diseases. Our goal is to continue to immerse undergraduates and medical students in a structured
and intensive research experience that will serve to encourage them to continually seek opportunities to
develop their scientific and research skills as they move forward in their careers and inspire them to ultimately
become part of and thereby reinforce the biomedical research workforce."
10800776,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the second most common leukemia in adults and typically has a dismal
prognosis and high mortality, which is exemplified by a 28% five-year overall survival rate. Venetoclax, a selective
inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2, has received FDA approval for the treatment of AML. Despite
promising early responses of AML patients to venetoclax, drug resistance ensues after prolonged treatment and
highlights the urgency for a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Recently, I discovered that
mitochondria in AML cells undergo a morphological change upon venetoclax resistance. Using a genome-wide
CRISPRi screen in human AML, I identified genes involved in mitochondrial structure as synthetic lethal
vulnerabilities for venetoclax in AML. Mitochondria of venetoclax-resistant AML cells actively modify their
architecture and function to prevent apoptosis. Supporting this, OPA1, the master regulator of mitochondrial
cristae structure, and CLPB, a mitochondrial chaperonin, were strikingly upregulated in venetoclax-resistant AML
cells relative to the sensitive cells. CLPB directly interacts with OPA1 to maintain the physiological mitochondrial
morphology. Promisingly, genetic CLPB or OPA1 ablation enhances venetoclax-induced apoptosis of AML cells,
by promoting cristae remodeling and mitochondrial stress.
This proposal aims to leverage these observations by 1) delineating the mechanistic details by which
mitochondrial dynamics and homeostasis lead to acquisition of drug resistance in AML, using super-resolution
microscopy, electron tomography, and biochemical techniques, and 2) assessing the therapeutic potential of
perturbing mitochondrial structure to augment venetoclax action in preclinical AML mouse models. This research
stands to have significant clinical impact, because it can serve as a basis for developing new combinational
targeted therapies for patients with AML.
In addition, this proposal outlines my career development plan for obtaining the requisite training to transition
into a successful independent investigator. This includes 1) guidance from my esteemed mentor Dr. Iannis
Aifantis, expert in blood malignancies and mouse models; 2) scientific training by an expert advisory panel,
consisting of Drs. Raoul Tibes, Hans-Willem Snoeck, Kivanc Birsoy and Evripidis Gavathiotis, all in top institutes
of NYC; 3) hands-on training using state-of-art equipment, including super-resolution microscopy with Dr. Eli
Rothenberg; 4) collaboration with experts in microscopy and bioinformatics; and 5) career development courses
sponsored by NYU. The laboratory of Dr. Aifantis and NYU Department of Pathology will provide the resources
critical to my training and research, ensuring my success. This extensive professional growth program will guide
me during the mentored phase excelling as an independent academic scientist. Collectively, the proposed
research and career development plans are expected to generate data with significant impact on circumventing
targeted-therapy resistance in AML and setting the basis of my future research as an independent researcher."
10810042,"The physician-scientist workforce has been an important driver for many of the substantial discoveries in
infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases over the last two decades. Yet, this workforce has been in decline.
Residency training typically offers little time or support for research. This major gap in the development of
physician-scientists limits the translation of research into the clinical arena. Following a long, independent history
of training successful physician-scientists, in 2018 Duke was awarded an R38 award to establish the Duke NIAID
Scientist-Clinician-Investigator Stimulating access to Research in Residency (Duke NIAID SCI-StARR) program.
The primary goal of this multidisciplinary program is to train physician-scientists in all aspects of biomedical
research in order to cultivate investigators who will lead the development, implementation, and evaluation of new
clinical modalities to diagnose, treat and prevent infectious, immunologic and allergic diseases in children and
adults. Duke NIAID SCI-StARR trains residents from Medicine, Pediatrics, and Surgery in areas along the full
biomedical research continuum (basic/translational, early phase clinical trials and pharmacokinetics, and late
phase clinical trials and outcomes) with a theme of improving health over the life course. The program
comprises four training aims: 1) comprehensive didactics covering basic, translational, and clinical research and
professional development; 2) development and completion of a research project and an individualized career
development plan; 3) establishment of a track record of scholarly activity; and 4) eligibility for board certification
and continuation to subspecialty training. Duke NIAID SCI-StARR leadership includes an Executive Committee
of MPIs Scott Palmer, MD, MHS (Medicine), Rachel Greenberg, MD, MB, MS (Pediatrics), and David Harpole,
Jr, MD (Surgery), along with Residency Program Directors and Program Coordinators from each department.
Duke NIAID SCI-StARR capitalizes on a team of 32 multi-departmental, multi-disciplinary, well-funded, and
experienced faculty preceptors available to all trainees, independent of their clinical department. This renewal
builds on the success of the initial funding period in which 13 residents (3 Medicine, 3 Pediatrics, 7 Surgery)
were trained and requests support for 18-24 months of protected research time for three Resident-Investigators
appointed annually. Unlike PhDs, physician-scientists must spend several years completing clinical training prior
to returning to laboratory research. To bridge this gap, our program provides two years of technician support
after completing the fellowship. Thus, our trainees will be prepared to transition to research-intense fellowship
training, successfully compete for extramural funding to support a path to independence, and become the next
generation of physicians leading and mentoring trainees in clinically-oriented research of allergy, immunology,
and infectious diseases affecting children and adults. Achievement of the program's objectives will continue to
fulfill urgent needs for: 1) academic physician-scientists and mentors in medical schools throughout the country
and 2) innovations and clinical translation of novel strategies to improve human health across the life course.

10809965,"Project Summary
Ambulatory children with cerebral palsy (CP) can have profound impairments of the lower
extremities including physical deformities, loss of motor function, and resultant poor quality of
life. Orthopedic multi-level surgery (MLS) is standard of care to address lower extremity
impairments and children experience a decrease in function requiring extensive physical
therapy (PT) for up to two years to regain function. Evidence for post-surgical PT best practices
is vastly unknown. This application proposes a pilot project to obtain preliminary data examining
the variation in PT frequency and type of intervention delivered during usual care across
settings to ambulatory children with CP following MLS, and describe the relationship between
type of intervention and recovery of gait at 6 months. Participants will be recruited from two
large academic centers where MLS surgery is performed. Sixteen ambulatory children with CP
that undergo MLS, consisting of at least one bony and any number of soft tissue procedures,
will be recruited and evaluated at baseline before surgery and 6 months post-surgery. Using a
published path model for studying dose in CP, comprehensive details about therapy frequency
and type will be captured via our successful EHR implemented flowsheet for children treated at
the two academic sites, and via REDCap surveys, with identical fields to the flowsheet, from
outpatient community therapists. This study will capture details on all types of PT intervention
delivered with specific interest in the five types delivered to children with CP following MLS, with
the most recent evidence (in children that have not undergone surgery), to improve gait. These
five types include mobility training, treadmill training, partial body weight supported treadmill
training, fitness training and ankle foot orthoses (AFOs). We will count the total number of PT
Interventions to improve Gait (PTIG) delivered and describe the relationship between PITGs to
the recovery of gait at six months post-surgery. We hypothesize that children seen by academic
therapists for post-surgical PT will have greater frequency of therapy sessions and higher count
of PTIGS than children seen by community outpatient therapists. We also hypothesize that the
count of PTIGs delivered will have a positive relationship with gait measured in two ways; self-
selected walking speed and walking performance (steps/day). The proposed research is
innovative and will guide development of precision rehabilitation approaches that are
translatable to clinical practice. The proposed research is significant because findings will inform
future work to determine the most effective strategies to improve health and motor outcomes for
children with CP after MLS."
10809148,"Title: Glioblastoma-secreted GABA contributes to the immunosuppressive environment
Abstract:
 Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most common and lethal human brain tumors and there are no
effective treatments. We have shown that immune cells have GABA-receptors (GABA-Rs) and that their
activation limits inflammatory immune responses. Indeed, three recent studies of several different types of
peripheral solid tumors have demonstrated that tumor cells, or B cells within tumors, can secrete GABA which
dramatically shifts the phenotype of human and murine tumor-infiltrating macrophages and dendritic cells
towards anti-inflammatory phenotypes and inhibits the activity of infiltrating CD8+ effector T cells, consistent
with our findings of GABA’s action in autoimmune diseases. GABA-R antagonists, or inactivation of the GABA-
synthesizing enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD67), significantly decreases tumor burden in these
models. Thus, GABA is an important intra-tumor immunosuppressive factor in these peripheral tumors.
 There are multiple lines of evidence indicating that glioblastoma cells secrete high levels of GABA. Our
central hypothesis is that GBM-secreted GABA contributes to the immunosuppressive tumor environment. Our
proposed studies with GAD67-deficient GBM cell lines will determine 1) whether GBM-secreted GABA
modulates the frequency, phenotype, and localization of tumor infiltrating immune cells, 2) how GABA
deficiency modulates GBM gene expression, and 3) whether rendering GBMs GABA-deficient confers a
survival advantage.
 These investigations will collectively provide the first understanding of how GBM-secreted GABA
transforms the tumor microenvironment and affects survival. If our central hypothesis is supported, future
studies can examine whether making anti-tumor responses resistant to GABA inhibition could improve their
effector functions. For example, we may be able to enhance the effectiveness of NK, DC, or T cell-based
therapies by making them GABA-R deficient. Alternatively, new therapies may be designed to specifically
target immune cell GABA-Rs or their signaling pathways."
10931742,"Project Summary/Abstract
Since the introduction of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), HIV infection has been converted
from a fatal disease into a chronic condition. Liver disease has emerged as the second leading cause of non-
AIDS related death in persons living with HIV (PLWH). Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading
form of chronic liver disease in the U.S., afflicting approximately 30% of adults. PLWH have a high prevalence
of NAFLD with rates as high as 53%, associated with not only higher frequency of the inflammatory non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH) but also accelerated liver fibrosis progression. Moreover, in NAFLD/HIV, there is a
disproportionate burden of progressive NASH and fibrosis compared with HIV(-) NAFLD. While recent studies
have replicated the accelerated fibrosis progression seen in PLWH/NAFLD, the precise mechanisms remain
poorly defined. We and others have led the field in demonstrating that HIV itself induces a profibrogenic program
in the liver via several pathways. The Hippo signaling pathway controls cell proliferation and fibrogenesis through
YAP transcriptional co-activators that regulate more than 400 genes through binding to TEAD, SMAD1/2/3 and
other sites. Our recent work has shown increases in YAP-related gene expression among NAFLD patients with
fibrosis and in mouse NASH models. We also observed a significant reduction in fibrosis-related parameters in
hepatocyte-specific YAP knockout mice fed a NASH diet. We have also shown that HIV induces YAP activation
in hepatocytes and macrophages via the LPA/PI3K and AKT pathways. Therefore, HIV and NAFLD likely
cooperate at the level of YAP activation to contribute to fibrogenesis and liver damage. Hepatic and monocyte-
derived macrophages, dysregulated by HIV infection and polarized during liver injury, are likely to contribute to
NAFLD and HIV-related liver disease. Studies have observed increased macrophage content in the livers of
PLWH and others have linked YAP activation to macrophage infiltration. However, comprehensive studies of the
in vitro and in vivo effects of YAP activation among the key cell types (hepatocytes, macrophages, and HSCs)
that drive fibrogenesis in PLWH are lacking. We hypothesize that HIV and NAFLD exert independent and additive
effects on YAP activation in both macrophage and hepatocyte populations that in turn accelerate hepatic fibrosis
progression through their action on HSCs. In this proposal, using novel coculture assays, ex vivo liver tissue,
and a humanized mouse model and combining the efforts of liver pathogenesis and HIV virology/pathogenesis
experts, we will: (1) define the contribution of YAP signaling to macrophage polarization, hepatocyte and hepatic
stellate cell (HSC) activation in HIV/NAFLD.; (2) assess the effect of cART regimens on macrophage, hepatocyte
and HSC phenotypes and YAP activation in models of HIV/NAFLD.; and (3) determine the effects of YAP
inhibition on fibrogenesis in HIV/NAFLD. A detailed understanding of the upstream and downstream regulators
of YAP in NAFLD/HIV is likely to uncover novel antifibrotic strategies for NAFLD that could block this highly
prevalent progressive liver disease in PLWH.

10809373,"Project Summary
 Hair cells are auditory mechanoreceptors that use an apically located hair bundle to convert mechanical
vibrations due to sound into electrical activity, a process termed mechanotransduction. The
mechanotransduction process is essential to cochlear amplification, which is responsible for our excellent sound
level sensitivity, large dynamic range, and amazing frequency discrimination. Loss of mechanotransduction leads
to loss of cochlear amplification. Control of the range of sensitivity of the mechanotransduction process is
hypothesized to be a key contributor to augmenting the dynamic range. In this proposal, we will investigate two
mechanisms that can control the range of stimuli to which the hair cell is responsive.
 Mechanotransduction adaptation can adjust the range of sensitivity in the presence of an ongoing stimulus.
One type of adaptation described decades ago is termed slow adaptation due to its kinetics. Slow adaptation
was hypothesized to function via the motor model of adaptation. We recently overturned the motor model of slow
adaptation, and we now propose a new model of slow adaptation requiring the phosphoinositide PIP2. In this
proposal, we build upon our existing data by studying specific mutations in TMC1, the putative
mechanotransduction channel, that we hypothesize to have a role in mediating PIP2 binding to modulate channel
function. These experiments will provide mechanistic insight for slow adaptation.
 The second mechanism of sensitivity control is through cAMP. We recently discovered that cAMP functions
to reduce gating spring stiffness, thereby controlling the sensitivity of the mechanotransduction channel. In this
proposal, we will study the upstream and downstream signaling pathways using knockout mouse models to
identify the molecular contributors to the pathway. These models will allow us to also identify the physiological
role of the cAMP pathway in the cochlea. These experiments will lead us one step closer to understanding the
role of cAMP in normal hearing function and identifying the molecular component(s) of the gating spring, which
is the final downstream target."
10929501,"Project Summary
 For the 12 months ending in September 2022, more than 100,500 Americans died from an overdose,
the majority of which involved opioids. Substantial national, state, and local resources have been invested in
reducing the prevalence of overdose deaths in the United States. But rather than substantively declining, the
annual overdose death count has remained over 100,000 for year-over-year reports since June 2021. There is
no obvious, single solution to the overdose epidemic, which is a ‘wicked problem’ requiring a multifaceted
prevention, treatment, and recovery system addressing a wide variety of risk factors. However, it is
unequivocally clear that naloxone, an opioid antagonist that can reverse overdose, is a highly effective, rapid
response tool that can save lives.
 What is perhaps less well understood is that naloxone is remarkably underutilized; in 2019, fewer
than one quarter of fatal opioid-involved overdoses in the US had any evidence of naloxone administration
prior to death. For naloxone to be an effective solution, it must be present at the scene (e.g., a dose must be
within a radius of an overdose where it can be used) and someone within that radius also needs to be trained
and willing to administer it. Overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) programming for laypersons
(e.g., bystanders; other citizens who are not first responders or medical professionals) has been shown to be
feasible and effective in reducing fatal overdose rates but does not presently have sufficient reach. As a
solution, we propose a strategy to leverage the PulsePoint Respond app and network to facilitate OEND
programming. The PulsePoint network is an existing, national network of more than 4,400 community first
responder agencies who coordinate with 894,744 layperson CPR responders who already have indicated
willingness to respond to unconscious and unresponsive persons in public. These layperson responders are
notified through the app when a community first response agency deploys an emergency response team to an
unconscious or unresponsive person in public who is within a certain radius of the layperson. This means that
the infrastructure to deploy individuals to potential opioid overdoses already exists and is active, but the citizen
responders have not necessarily been trained (overdose education and naloxone use) or carry naloxone.
 We will test the feasibility of recruiting PulsePoint agencies and layperson responders for OEND using
a 3-arm, multi-stage randomized controlled trial that will assess (1) recruitment of community first responder
agencies and (2) layperson engagement with OEND programming across (a) a standard recruitment condition,
(b) an overdose/naloxone misinformation debunking condition, and (c) a control condition. We will also conduct
qualitative follow-up analyses. Successful completion of this project will directly inform procedures for a follow-
up R01 application to test this approach with an outcomes-focused randomized, controlled trial across a much
larger (1,000+) community sample with a goal of meaningfully reducing community fatal overdose rates."
10813074,"Although it is increasingly recognized that the interaction of the diet and host specific genetic factors in the gut play an important role in intestinal and systemic disease, our understanding of in this emerging field is still limited and this represents an important knowledge gap. Here we propose to bridge this gap by advancing our knowledge how telomere shortening in the gut impacts the maturation of enterocytes, the terminally differentiated cells that are essential for barrier maintenance and absorption. Telomeres are important for the regeneration of stem cell-dependent tissues such as the intestine. Telomere shortening occurs during normal aging and is accelerated in patients with mutations in telomerase or in high cell turnover conditions such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. Telomere shortening causes several pathologies in the intestine including atrophy, inflammation, and progression of colitis to cancer in patients and all these pathologies are faithfully recapitulated in telomerase knockout mice (TKO). Mechanistically, it is believed that short telomeres drive these pathologies through continuous apoptosis-mediated depletion of intestinal stem cells. Beyond stem cell- depletion, other pathogenic mechanisms are not known. In particular, it is not known whether telomere shortening compromises differentiated cell lineages in the gut, of which enterocytes represent the vast majority. Here we have found that telomere shortening impairs the maturation towards the enterocyte lineage leading to the generation of immature and functionally compromised enterocytes. This is supported by a multi- level analysis including RNAseq, proteomics, transmission and scanning electron microscopy demonstrating that the expression of digestive enzymes, transporters and structural components of microvilli are repressed in the proximal intestine in TKO mice. Importantly, preliminary studies indicate that this enterocyte compromise is preserved in human enterocytes with short telomeres. Mechanistically, deletion of p53 in TKO epithelium rescues enterocyte defects. Furthermore, these enterocytes are characterized by mitochondrial dysfunction and have low ATP levels. When exposed to a fructose-rich diet, they show pronounced propensity to steep decline in ATP levels and subsequent apoptosis, which exacerbates the barrier defect and malabsorption. Here we propose to establish the mechanisms through which p53 causes differentiation defects (Aim 1), establish whether the low ATP levels are the driving source for fructose toxicity by increasing ATP levels either through inactivation of the ATP depleting enzyme fructokinase or improving mitochondrial function through NAD supplementation. In Aim 3 we establish the relevance of short telomeres in causing enterocyte defects in humans using cell lines, organoids and enteroids with various telomere length."
10813081,"Our work over the course of nearly 25 years of this grant have revealed insights onto the pore-forming mechanism
of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (CDCs), which have laid the foundations to understand the basis by which
this large class of toxins make the transition from soluble monomers to large oligomeric membrane-embedded
pore complexes. In the next 5 years of the merit award we propose to address three specific aims, which will
continue our work on the CDCs but will also open up new major fields of research in related areas. In the first aim
we will address outstanding issues in the mechanism of the CDC pore-forming mechanism. The first of these is to
understand how the β-barrel pore assembles and inserts into the membrane bilayer. This is a question that applies
to all β-barrel pore-forming proteins but is fraught with complicating thermodynamic factors. Using our previous
discoveries of the transition state barriers to pore formation and the ability to change the nature of the β-hairpins
we will determine the mechanism of β-barrel assembly and membrane insertion. These studies will also address a
contentious issue in the CDC-mechanism, which is whether incomplete oligomers (rather than complete rings)
can insert a partial β-barrel into the membrane. In this aim we will also reassess the basis by which the listeriolysin
0 pH sensor functions, as we have recent published data and preliminary studies, which suggest that our original
hypothesis made in 1995 is not the mechanism of pH sensing. In the second aim we plan to pursue the study of
the CDC-like (CDCL) proteins that we have determined to be ancient relatives of the CDCs (perhaps the
forerunners of the CDCs), the genes for which are widespread in numerous bacterial species (>300 so far) from at
least 6 different phyla, as well as a few species of diatoms and fungi. Our primary goals are to (1) understand the
pore-forming mechanism of these toxins, as some preliminary data suggest there are some fundamental
differences with the CDCs, and (2) to identify the prokaryotic and/or eukaryotic targets of several of these proteins
isolated from species from the oral and intestinal human microbiomes and from terrestrial environments, as none
of the CDCL binding domains exhibit any similarity to the canonical binding domain of the CDCs. In the third aim
we plan to study the mechanism of bacterial killing by a novel class of anti-bacterial toxins that are produced by a
few species of the Provotella and Bacteroides found in the oral and intestinal microbiome of humans. Our
preliminary studies suggest that they are proteolytically-activated toxins that form higher order complexes
(possibly pore-forming toxins), which target various species of bacteria. Our preliminary studies suggest that they
are a unique class of antibacterial toxin, as there are no known class of prokaryotic or eukaryotic toxins that exhibit
any similarity to the primary structure of these toxins."
10813083,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic demyelinating disease affecting primarily people during their
active years of life. Long-lasting demyelination leads to axonal degeneration with severe
neurological deficits, and in most cases remyelination is limited. Remyelination failure could
occur due to the inability of existing oligodendrocytes (OLs) to myelinate demyelinated axons or
failure of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to generate myelinating OLs in the lesion.
 The dynamics of OLs lineage cells is intricately modulated by the local neural activity. OPCs
receive synaptic and non-synaptic signals from neurons and undergo depolarization or increase
intracellular Ca2+. However, exactly how OPCs sense the level of neuronal activity and initiate a
signaling cascade that triggers a terminal differentiation and survival response has remained
unclear. In neurons, depolarization-induced Ca2+ entry into axons triggers release of
neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles clustered at the presynaptic terminal by a series of
molecular events that involve SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment
protein receptor) proteins. OL lineage cells also express various SNARE proteins and transcripts. Our preliminary results of inactivating vesicular SNARE proteins in OPCs and their progeny revealed that SNARE-
dependent mechanisms are critical for the proper generation of viable OLs. These observations led
us to hypothesize that vesicular SNARE-dependent exocytosis in late OPCs is triggered by
neuronal signals and has a critical autocrine function to promote OL differentiation and survival
of new OLs. This will be tested by 1) fate analysis of divided OPCs that have defective vesicular
SNAREs to determine whether loss of Vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 and/or 3
(VAMP2/3) function compromises OL differentiation and survival (Aim 1); 2) imaging SNARE-
containing vesicles and exocytosis events in cultured OPCs and in vivo to determine whether
neuronally derived signals promote SNARE-mediated exocytosis and clustering of vesicles
(Aim 2); and 3) a proteomics approach to identify the autocrine signal(s) that is released from
OPCs in a SNARE-dependent manner (Aim 3).  The project will establish experimental evidence for a novel principle regarding the cellular mechanism by which late OPCs trigger their terminal differentiation and survival programs in
response to neuronal signals."
10813084,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 About 1 in 151 women in the US are carriers of a genetic abnormality called the FMR1 premutation
(FXpm). Mothers who carry the FXpm are at risk for passing the mutated gene to their children, which may result
in fragile X syndrome. The FXpm is also associated with substantially increased risk for disease, including
neurodegenerative disease, premature menopause, psychiatric involvement, and executive and social deficits.
New evidence suggests that FXpm carrier mothers may experience premature age-related decline across
multiple symptom domains. The aging expression of FXpm phenotype is particularly concerning when applied
within the context of fragile X families because these symptoms impact not only the carrier mother, but also her
ability to care and advocate for her children with fragile X syndrome. However, almost all evidence of age-
related decline in this group has been gleaned from cross-sectional data that are insufficient for drawing robust
longitudinal trajectories. This represents a substantial barrier to effective clinical management, as we lack the
data needed to understand the long-term effects of the FXpm genotype and its implications for families.
 This proposal seeks to determine the stability of key FXpm phenotypes (mental health, executive, social)
across midlife and early old age in FXpm carrier mothers compared to healthy controls (Aim 1); investigate
autonomic and molecular-genetic factors associated with age-related symptom expression and their interface
with parenting stress (Aim 2); and evaluate functional limitations associated with FXpm symptoms across age
(Aim 3). We will accomplish these aims by adopting an accelerated longitudinal design to track age-related
change occurring across 45-80 years in 75 FXpm carrier mothers compared to 75 control mothers. The over-
arching goal is to inform the critical age periods and risk factors in age-related decline, as well as to lay the
groundwork for future mechanistic studies. This work is necessary to develop strategies to ameliorate FXpm
symptoms, which will improve outcomes for both FXpm carrier mothers and their children with fragile X
syndrome."

10813100,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This project conducts longitudinal Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) biomarker imaging on participants in the Wisconsin
Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention, a midlife observational cohort that is risk-enriched for AD due to parental
history of AD dementia. We have been conducting longitudinal amyloid positron emission tomography (PET)
with [11C]PiB since 2009 and tau PET with [18F]MK-6240 since 2017 together with advanced MRI, CSF and now
longitudinal plasma biomarkers. In the prior funding period we demonstrated that non-demented persons who
are Amyloid positive (A+), and tau+ (T+) have been exhibiting cognitive decline since midlife; we developed
computational methods to construe amyloid from a temporal standpoint, including individual estimates of A+
onset age and its duration; we found that A+ chronicity predicts cognitive decline and time to dementia—which
is ~23 years, giving empirical support to an oft-cited heuristic; we were an early adopter of [18F]MK-6240 for tau
PET imaging and delineated its imaging characteristics; we developed and applied cutting edge measures of
vascular compromise in the brain with dynamic 4D flow imaging including novel ways for assessing vessel
stiffness that is associated with amyloid. The overarching hypothesis of this renewal is that recontextualizing
PET amyloid burden along its temporal dimension and anchoring our analyses to A+ onset age and/or its duration
will explain heterogeneity in the expression of other biomarkers and cognitive decline. A secondary goal is to
determine what can be learned from serial plasma markers of A and T and N (relative to A+ chronology). In Aim
1, anchored to amyloid onset age we will examine factors related to progression of other biomarkers including
tau, and examine cognitive decline over a 15 yr period of observation. We will determine the characteristics
associated with T+ onset and rate of change (using MK6240 PET) relative to A+ chronicity; we will identify those
who are exhibiting disease resistance (i.e., T- in the presence of more chronic A+) and identify the modifiable
and genetic factors associated with this biomarker pattern; we will also examine plasma and CSF markers of AD
and related disorders. In Aim 2: We will examine conditional processes regarding the added influence of vascular
MRI measures on cognitive decline in the presence of progressing AD proteinopathy and patterns of
neurodegeneration. Finally, Aim 3 employs computational algorithms to create a joint spatiotemporal profile of
amyloid tau and neurodegeneration enabling a joint estimate of disease burden and progression. Significance:
This work will fill in the biomarker timeline from late-middle age, providing clarity on the temporal span of
preclinical AD proteinopathy anchored to amyloid onset. This project has the potential to greatly improve
individualized prognostic precision in view of overall known disease burden, to shed insight on characteristics of
disease resistance, and inform prevention strategies."

10813854,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A child’s ability to communicate and learn through language plays a fundamental role in their cognitive, social,
and functional development. Impairment in language development is shared across many neurodevelopmental
disorders and can have a profound influence on a child’s future functional and developmental outcome.
Unfortunately, our current understanding of the neurobiology underlying language deficits in
neurodevelopmental disorders is limited, especially as it pertains to children with concurrent intellectual
disability. In alignment with the strategic plan from NIDCD’s Voice, Speech, and Language program area, this
project seeks to use EEG to identify neural markers (endophenotypes) associated with the progression and
developmental course of speech and language impairments (Priority Area 2; Natural History and
Epidemiology) in two understudied populations – children with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and minimally verbal
children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Priority Area 3; Understudied Populations). Neural markers
identified through this study, could be used as biomarkers for prognosis, and treatment monitoring of language
development for children with FXS and ASD, as well as inform new treatments (Priority Area 3: Detection,
Diagnosis and Hypothesis-Driven Interventions). The proposed project has the following scientific goals: (1)
Characterize electrophysiological similarities and differences across preschool-aged boys with FXS, ASD with
language impairment, and typically developing boys; (2) Identify and characterize neural markers of concurrent
language ability in FXS and ASD; and (3) Identify and characterize neural markers of future language
acquisition in FXS and ASD. To do this, we will collect EEG in three groups of boys aged 2- to 5-years-old: 30
boys with FXS, 30 boys with idiopathic ASD with language impairment (n=30), and 30 typically developing
boys. At the same visit and a second visit one year apart, participants will undergo language and cognitive
assessments to determine their language development. The proposed project is supported by a world class
team of mentors who are experts in developmental cognitive neuroscience, language development, and
advanced EEG techniques. The research environment at Boston Children’s Hospital is exceptional and the
surrounding intellectual resources at Harvard, Boston University, MGH, and MIT are unmatched. My training
plan is specifically designed to provide advanced training in EEG analysis, auditory processing, and language
assessments for minimally verbal children, that are crucial to investigating brain-behavior relationships in these
heterogenous, understudied, at-risk populations. In addition, during my training I will gain practical experience
in how to successfully manage longitudinal aspects of cohort study design. By the completion of the career
development award, I will have successfully applied for R01-level funding and will be ready to transition to a
fully independent physician-scientist."

Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) are on the rise in the United
States. Estimates project a 40% increase in AD among older Americans by 2025. This increase, along with its
associated economic, social, and health burdens, are likely to have disproportionate impacts, as Black adults
have the highest incidence of dementia of any racial/ethnic group in the U.S. Moreover, Black Americans
experience higher rates of established biological risk factors for AD/ADRD, including hypertension, diabetes,
stroke, inflammation, and biological aging. The expected growth in AD diagnoses, expenditures, and burdens,
as well as potentially widening racial inequalities, make it imperative to investigate early risk factors for the
development of AD/ADRD and racial inequalities in AD/ADRD. Structural forms of racism are likely important
drivers of racial inequalities in AD/ADRD risk. Yet, much of the research in this area focuses on downstream
factors, such as exposure to stressors and discrimination, or specific domains of structural racism at one point
in time. Missing are longitudinal studies of structural racism and aging-related health inequalities across
multiple geographic contexts. Further, there is limited knowledge of how public health and policy interventions
addressing structural racism can be utilized to reduce racial inequalities in AD/ADRD. Causal modeling
techniques provide opportunities to assess the impact of structural interventions on documented inequalities in
biological risk factors for AD/ADRD using observational data. The purpose of this project is twofold: 1) to create
a public-use, comprehensive data repository of multilevel and repeated contextual measures of structural
racism; and 2) use the new contextual data in combination with existing contextual and individual-level
longitudinal data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) to examine
specific pathways linking structural racism and AD/ADRD biological risk among early midlife U.S. adults.
Specifically, we will investigate whether structural racism across educational, residential, and criminal justice
contexts independently and jointly shape Black-White disparities in biological risk factors for AD/ADRD,
including hypertension, diabetes, inflammation, epigenetic aging, and two novel biomarkers of AD/ADRD risk
(neurofilament light and total tau). We will also use simulation models to compare the effects of hypothetical
population-based policy changes and targeted interventions on racial inequalities in biological risk factors of
AD/ADRD risk. Findings from this study will advance our understanding of how structural racism shapes
AD/ADRD risk early in the life course. Results from simulation models will also inform the development of
population-level, early interventions aimed to slow the progression of AD/ADRD risk and reduce health
inequalities in these outcomes."

Spanish learners in the United States (US) are the fastest growing group among children, yet the research
base to support their early oral language development in the face of language delay is lacking. To meet this
identified research gap, the proposed overall objectives are to examine the specific influence of (a) dual-
language learning (DLL) status and (b) caregiver input and interactions lexical-semantic development in
children with language delay. Thus, the proposed study seeks to provide a detailed and longitudinal model of
lexical-semantic growth in Spanish-learning children in the US who have early language delays and are at risk
for language impairment. The central hypothesis is that a multidimensional and precise approach to the
assessment of lexical-semantic growth that incorporates DLL status and language delay will be a better model
and predictor of later language production than is the widely used single measure of vocabulary size. Further, it
is hypothesized that high quality and quantity caregiver language input will predict stronger child outcomes
across all multidimensional measures of lexical-semantic growth. Aim 1 takes a multidimensional approach by
seeking to document the predictive validity of lexical-semantic breadth, access, and organization on vocabulary
acquisition over time in Spanish learners with language delays. Aim 2 investigates the influence of dual-
language exposure on lexical-semantic development. Aim 3 assesses the role of caregiver language input and
interactions in supporting lexical-semantic growth and ultimately language outcomes. To meet these aims,
Spanish-learning Latino children and their caregivers will be studied longitudinally across a well-known period
of rapid lexical acquisition in toddlerhood. Lexical-semantic development will be assessed using novel
behavioral tasks designed to capture the dynamic interaction between several dimensions (i.e., lexical-
semantic breadth, organization, and access) that together support word learning. This approach represents a
significant and meaningful contribution to the field because it meets a critical need to describe the specific
deficits in lexical-semantic growth for children with LD with dual-language exposure. Importantly, the study
examines the mechanism by which caregiver language input supports lexical-semantic growth in predicting
later oral language outcomes in Latino Spanish-learning toddlers with early delays. The proposed work is
innovative because it represents an interdisciplinary and substantive departure from the status quo by (a)
providing a multidimensional understanding of lexical-semantic growth in children with LD, (b) examining
Spanish learners in the US along a continuum of dual-language exposure, and (c) studying the caregiver input
factors that promote lexical-semantic acquisition."

Atherosclerosis is a disease of the mid- and large-sized arteries that promotes plaque formation. Plaque
development can lead to restricted blood flow, vessel rigidity, and in some cases thrombosis. Atherosclerosis is
a major underlying condition that promotes the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease,
such as heart disease and stroke. Atherosclerosis is mediated by chronic exposure to elevated serum cholesterol
which leads to deposition and accumulation of inflammatory cells in the intima-region of the vessel wall.
Monocyte infiltration is a hallmark of disease progression where cells differentiate into lipid-laden macrophages,
termed “foamy cells”. We interrogated single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) gene expression data from
atherosclerotic plaques which identified genes uniquely associated with foamy macrophages, including the
myeloid lipid sensor Trem2. Additionally, an unbiased genome-wide Crispr-screen of in vitro derived foamy
macrophages found Trem2 was required for oxidized LDL uptake. However, paradoxically, Trem2 was also
required for efflux of cholesterol in foamy macrophages. Since Trem2 has been associated with enhanced lipid
uptake in adipose macrophages and efflux in microglia, we sought to test its role in atherosclerosis. Using Trem2-
knockout and conditional Trem2-deletion approaches, we found Trem2 mediates lipid accumulation in plaque
macrophages and loss of Trem2 resulted in a dramatic reduction in atherosclerotic plaque size. Thus, based on
our preliminary data, we hypothesize that Trem2 regulates foamy macrophage lipid uptake and survival in
atherosclerosis. We have extensive experience studying myeloid cells in atherosclerosis and include newly
developed monocyte fate-mapping model to track monocyte differentiation in plaque, and a viral atherosclerosis
regression model, which places our lab in unique position to address the questions outlined in this application.
In addition, we incorporate a Trem2 agonistic antibody as an approach to complement deletion experiments to
determine the mechanisms of Trem2 in atherosclerotic disease. Together, we will address the role of Trem2 in
atherosclerosis progression, examine in depth signaling mechanisms in foamy cells that are regulated by Trem2,
and determine whether Trem2 is a therapeutic target for intervention. Findings from this study represent
potentially highly impactful knowledge for translation of a novel candidate to drive plaque regression in
atherosclerosis patients."

two mRNA vaccines to prevent against SARS-CoV-2 and the first three FDA approved RNAi drugs targeted to
the liver. Unfortunately, RNA-based drugs targeted to cancer cells is lagging behind, even with countless years
of work that has revealed the power of using RNAi for treating oncological diseases. Lack of success in this
space is attributed to inability to deliver RNAi safely and effectively. A successful delivery agent requires multiple
features. First, the agent must deliver the RNA specifically to the intended cells. Second, the agent must have a
large therapeutic window, meaning that toxicity, if observed, should occur at doses that are orders of magnitude
higher than the therapeutic dose. Third, if delivery of the RNA is by way of a specific ligand and receptor pair, as
is the case herein, the RNA must successfully escape the endosome. Simply swelling the endosome is not
enough if noncovalent interactions between the ligand and the receptor cannot be disrupted. Fourth, the RNA
should include appropriate stabilizing modifications to increase intracellular half-life that will reduce dosing and
cost. Through hard work and dedication in this space, we have come up with an inclusive, easily synthesized,
intramolecular molecule that will achieve all of these essential features. Moreover, the ligand used to achieve
successful delivery is also being evaluated for imaging tumors localized in the central nervous system.
 The premise for this work is based on conjugating the tumor suppressive microRNA, miR-34a to 5-
methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), a ligand that is superior for the intended needs, in this case, release from the
receptor when an endosomal escape agent is present. Our preliminary data and strong scientific premise
supports our objective to i) advance 5-MTHF as a specific and non-toxic therapeutic ligand for delivery of
therapeutic miRNAs to triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and ii) to characterize and prepare 5-MTHF-nigericin
conjugated to a fully modified version of miR-34a for clinical trial. To support these objectives, the following Aims
will be conducted: 1) To test the hypothesis that both in vivo and intracellular biodistribution of 5-MTHF
conjugates are superior to folate conjugates, and 2) To evaluate activity, efficacy, toxicity, pharmacokinetics,
dynamics, and combinatorial effects of 5-MTHF-nigericin conjugated to fully modified miR-34a in vivo. At the
completion of this work we will have the first an all-encompassing RNAi delivery vehicle that can deliver a
stabilized RNA to the intended cells, into the correct subcellular location, with limited toxicity for the treatment of
TNBC."
10930949,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: The long-term objective of this proposal is to understand formation of the
midface skeleton, both during normal development, and in human genetic disease conditions. The midface
consists of the structures around the nose, the eye, and the upper jaw. Human genetic disorders, like
frontonasal dysplasia, affect these midface structures. Specifically, the ALX transcription factor encoding genes
have been implicated in multiple types of frontonasal dysplasia. Uniquely, we model these diseases in
zebrafish by using genetic mutants. We propose that the ALX genes function to specify an identity code which
patterns the vertebrate midface. Our model draws from examples like the DLX and HOX codes, which specify
identity in the dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes of the craniofacial skeleton, respectively. We propose
three specific aims to test our innovative “alx-bullseye code” hypothesis, that nested alx gene expression
directly regulates frontonasal skeletal identity. In Aim 1 we define the skeletal structures arising from the
alx-bullseye code in wild types using in situ hybridization, live cell tracking, and lineage tracing. Aim 2 will
determine whether alx gene combinations function to specify frontonasal identity. To identify these functions,
we will compare wild types to alx mutants examining gene expression, skeletal cell differentiation, and
misexpression phenotypes. Aim 3 will uncover how alx genes molecularly control cellular identity. We will
examine an in vivo Alx direct transcriptional reporter, ChIP-seq to identify Alx protein occupancy across the
genome, and Hi-C to reveal enhancer-promoter contacts mediated by Alx. Significance of this proposal is high,
the genes that we propose function in the alx bullseye code have direct human orthologs that are associated
with midface dysmorphologies. This proposal is innovative, as there has not yet been a patterning code
proposed for the vertebrate midface. Success of this proposal will enhance our understanding of midface
craniofacial development and human disease. By using the strengths of the zebrafish system to elucidate the
molecular, cellular, and genetic mechanisms underlying frontonasal dysplasia, we are fulfilling the mission of
the NIDCR to improve human health through research."
10812978,"Protein-derived cofactor in bifunctional enzyme KatG from Mycobacterium tuberculosis
Project Description
The catalase-peroxidase enzyme KatG is a heme-dependent protein critical for the virulence of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb). Its catalase function is essential for the pathogen to mitigate oxidative stress from hydrogen
peroxide in infected host cells. The catalase activity of KatG is distinct from other catalases due to the presence
of a protein-derived cofactor, methionine-tyrosine-tryptophan (MYW) covalent triad, which is an auto-catalytical
post-translationally modification. Because of the MYW cofactor, the catalase activity is more efficient by four
orders of magnitude compared to its peroxidase activity. However, KatG, as the sole catalase active protein in
Mtb and a key defense against oxidative damage by human host defenses, has not been appreciated. This is
primarily because the anti-tuberculosis prodrug isoniazid has been the primary focus of Mtb treatment. Isoniazid
takes advantage of the peroxidase activity for its activation. Here, we consider that the catalase function of KatG
may be targeted to provide a novel two-pronged assault on Mtb. The inhibition of catalase activity can directly
affect the virulence of Mtb, while also potentiating the peroxidase activity to boost isoniazid activation by KatG.
With this motivation, we have invested heavily to further our understanding of the MYW cofactor. Our preliminary
studies found that the protein-derived cofactor in KatG is naturally present in two forms. It is mainly in an MYW-
OOH form at ambient temperature and mild growth conditions. While at body temperature, it is primarily in the
catalase active MYW form. The MYW-OOH-containing KatG has little catalase activity but can autocatalytically
convert to the MYW-containing KatG when it encounters concentrated hydrogen peroxide, instinctually obtaining
catalase activity. Following these findings, we will further investigate the chemical nature of the protein-derived
cofactor in KatG using various experimental and computational approaches. Specifically, we will 1) examine the
chemical nature of the cofactor in the two forms and the conversion pathway from the catalase-inactive state to
its active form to inform why and how a hydroperoxyl group can be added/removed to an indole-nitrogen, an
unprecedented chemical process in a biological system, and what may be the chemical consequence of the
catalytic functions of KatG with an additional oxygenation modification of the cofactor, 2) dissect the role of the
crosslinked amino acid components of the cofactor, elucidate electronic and charge contribution in catalysis
through strategical alterations by using site-specific genetic substitution of non-canonical amino acids, and
evaluate how the strategically altered cofactors may distribute the oxidizing power distinctly and how they would
affect isoniazid activation, and 3) investigate the role of the heme environment cofactor biosynthesis and catalase
activity. These proposed studies take a new angle to obtain an in-depth molecular-level understanding of the
factors that govern the catalase and peroxidase activities of KatG. The knowledge learned will establish a
foundation for whether the catalase activity of KatG can be targeted to block its peroxide defense ability while
simultaneously enhancing the existing prodrug activation efficiency by the peroxidase activity of KatG."

 Adolescence is a period of heightened vulnerability to psychopathology and sensitivity to peer social contexts.
Due to the increasing use of online platforms, social media has been identified as a risk factor for the
significant rise in adolescent mental health issues. However, our current understanding is limited by methods
that do not fully capture that the link between social media and psychopathology is bidirectional, influenced by
the positive or negative nature of online content, and operates over both short and long-term timeframes. This
association changes over development and is highly variable across individuals and time. Understanding the
underlying factors that contribute to variations in outcomes in group-level studies of the impact of social media
on youth development is crucial for prevention and intervention at the individual level.
 Our project proposes conceptual and methodological improvements to capture interactions between social
media and emerging psychopathology at different person and time scales. First, conducting person-specific
research enables the identification of heterogeneity in the unique individual, bidirectional dynamics often
obscured by the pooling necessary to estimate average, group-level effects. Second, ecological momentary
assessment, which captures real-time dynamics of constant social media exposure, is ideal for testing the
cumulative effects of small influences. Third, given the transformation of peer interactions in adolescence, and
their contributing role to psychopathology, positive and negative interpersonal experiences on and off social
media emerge as a promising pathway to investigate. Fourth, longitudinal models are necessary for capturing
relative contributions of online versus in-person social interactions to developmental risk during adolescence.
 We will use a developmental cohort-accelerated longitudinal design to recruit a sample of youth in early
adolescence (n=150, 13-14 years) and middle adolescence (n=150, 15-16 years). Adolescents will be tracked
across four years, completing annual 30-day bursts of ecological momentary assessment of in-person and
social media interactions, socioemotional vulnerability, and psychopathology. Data accumulating across
cohorts will provide longitudinal coverage for each person over the span of four years, permitting analytic
leverage from early to late adolescence (i.e., observations from age 13 to age 19). We aim to test (1) real-time
differential susceptibility to positive/negative experiences across individuals and time, identifying
developmental windows of susceptibility to social media effects, (2) pathways for risk accumulation, and (3)
online vs in-person social contributions to developmental risk. We plan to directly test heterogeneity in the links
between social media use and psychopathology, which will provide critical insights beyond estimating the
average risk of social media use for adolescents. The long-term goal is to identify who is at the highest risk of
psychopathology, when during adolescence, due to what specific social media experiences, and how these
experiences bidirectionally accelerate or mitigate socioemotional risk and psychopathology."

Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) is characterized by polyclonal B cell activation, leading to the production
of pathogenic class-switched autoantibodies that promote tissue injury. These B cells undergo somatic mutation
and immunoglobulin isotype switching in extrafollicular (EF) sites and germinal centers (GCs) located within
secondary lymphoid organs, sites of CD4+ T cell-dependent B cell maturation. Mounting evidence suggests that
in lupus, autoantibody-producing B cells such as memory B cells, CD11c+Tbet+ B cells, and plasma cells are
generated via both EF and GC reactions. Yet, the contribution of each of these B cell subsets to the generation
and activity of autoantibodies in lupus remain unclear. CD11c+Tbet+ B cells (Tbet+ B cells herein) are a distinct
B cell subset that differentiate following viral infections as well as autoimmunity in mice and humans. Emerging
studies have shown that in murine and human lupus, Tbet+ B cells are critical drivers of pathogenic
autoantibodies. In lupus, Tbet+ B cells are capable of differentiating into class-switched autoantibody-secreting
cells upon stimulation by cytokines and TLR agonists. The presence of Tbet+ B cells in severe disease has been
well elucidated, but their development and contribution as disease progresses in lupus is poorly understood. We
found that the kinetics of Tbet+ B cell development and expansion in lupus-prone mice mirror the increase of
autoantibodies and worsening disease state. Moreover, we show a temporal loss of the GC-derived Tbet+ B cell
population coinciding with their expansion in the blood as disease progresses. We previously demonstrated that
Tbet+ B cells arise predominantly independent of GCs during viral infections, and our preliminary data show that
Tbet+ B cells appear to be mainly, but not exclusively, from EFs in lupus-prone mice as well. Tbet+ B cell
development in requires IFN- a subset of CD4+ T helper cells, T follicular helper (Tfh)
cells. These cytokines are secreted by Tfh cells throughout disease promoting pathogenic Tbet+ B cell
responses. We found that CD9 expression on Tfh cells identifies the IL-21 and IFN-γ secreting subset, which we
found to expanded in mice and human lupus. Our overarching hypothesis is Tbet+ B cells that arise from EF or
γ and IL-21 signaling from
GCs are transcriptionally and functionally distinct, but in lupus the chronic inflammatory milieu in different tissues
leads to their aberrant regulation and differentiation into ASCs that contribute to disease. Accordingly, we will
explore temporal changes in genetic regulation that functionally impact pathogenic Tbet+ B cell development
from EF or GCs and from tissues such as the kidney in autoimmune disease. We will use unique transgenic
lupus mice, combined with cellular techniques and novel genomic approaches to investigate the genetic
regulation influencing function of these B cells at different stages of disease. We will also examine the
requirement for the CD9-expressing Tfh cells in the generation and differentiation of Tbet+ B cells on both mouse
and human lupus. Ultimately, this work will help distinguish the pathway and tissue of origin of pathogenic and
nonpathogenic B and T cell subsets, aiding new avenues of therapeutic design to treat autoimmunity."

Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent but incurable malignancy of germinal center B (GCB)-cells, and is the
second most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Mutations of CREBBP, which encodes a lysine
acetyltransferase (KAT) protein, occur in ~60% of FL and arise early during disease evolution. We found that
conditional knock-out (KO) of Crebbp in murine models and can cooperate with Bcl2 over-expression to drive B-
cell lymphoma, but that these tumors had key differences to FL. Furthermore, FL tumors have a predominance
of missense mutations within the CREBBP KAT domain and infrequently harbor nonsense/frameshift mutations
that are modeled by KO. We therefore modeled the most frequent CREBBP KAT domain mutation, R1446C,
using CRISPR editing of a CREBBP wild-type (WT) lymphoma cell line and found that CREBBP-R1446C
mutation has a more profound epigenetic effect than biallelic knock-out (KO). Regions with reduced H3K27Ac
were enriched for loci that are normally bound by both CREBBP and BCL6 in germinal center B-cells, suggesting
that the loss H3K27Ac may be linked to failure of CREBBP to oppose BCL6-dependent HDAC3 activity. Notably,
BCL6 also recruits EZH2 and loss of H3K27Ac in CREBBP-R1446C cells was accompanied by a gain of the
EZH2-catalyzed H3K27me3 mark, suggesting that enhancer inactivation via loss of H3K27Ac is followed by
enhancer decommissioning through addition of H3K27me3. Furthermore, the CREBBP mutation phenotype
could be partially rescued by either HDAC3 or EZH2 inhibition, and was further enhanced by combination of
HDAC3 and EZH2 inhibitors. These results suggest that CREBBP KAT domain mutations suppress histone
acetylation through a dominant repressive mechanism, and that epigenetic crosstalk between CREBBP and
EZH2 may play a prominent role in regulating the epigenetic landscape of B-cell lymphoma. We have extended
upon these observations by performing biochemical and structural analysis of major CREBBP mutational
hotspots and observed key differences between the R1446C/H alleles and the next most common hotspots at
Y1482 and Y1503. These amino acids all reside within the catalytic pocket of CREBBP, but R1446 mediates
interaction with the CoA portion of the acetyl donor, acetyl-CoA, while Y1482 and Y1503 mediate interaction with
the acetyl group. While R1446 mutations maintain some catalytic activity, the Y1482 and Y1503 mutations are
catalytically dead. Therefore, these mutations are likely to have different functional consequences. In this
proposal, we aim to (i) characterize the mechanism of dominant epigenetic repression by CREBBP KAT domain
mutations and differences in function between KAT domain hotspot mutations, and (ii) define the role of
epigenetic crosstalk between CREBBP and EZH2 in B-cell lymphoma, and the consequences for response to
targeted agents."

Although there has been remarkable progress since the National Academy of Medicine’s report in 2013
describing a path towards Best Care at Lower Cost, we are not where we need to be. My research agenda
is to conduct patient-oriented research that advances our understanding of overuse of healthcare among
older adults. With the collaboration of junior investigators and other mentees, I will conduct research to
understand how health care systems reduce the harmful overuse of healthcare resources by their
Medicare beneficiaries through their delivery of high quality primary care. In the last four years of my
funded work, my team and I have come to recognize that there is not yet a comprehensive understanding
of drivers of overuse at the levels of the patient, clinician, and system, and the most optimal points for
interventions are not yet defined. We developed the Johns Hopkins Overuse Index which is an index of 20
procedures that can measure regional variation in the overuse of healthcare resource. The index has been
useful as an outcome measure and has allowed us to demonstrate the beneficial impact of higher regional
density of primary care doctors on reducing overuse both among Medicare beneficiaries and younger,
commercially insured people. I seek to understand the mechanisms by which high quality primary care
reduces overuse of resources in older adults through a mixed-methods evaluation of positively deviating
health systems and through modeling components of primary care delivery with mediation analysis
methods.
I also aim to improve the decisions made in the care of older adults by addressing a fundamental problem:
that unappreciated heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) contributes to overuse of healthcare in older
adults. Older adults are at particularly high risk of overuse of healthcare; this is both a discrete
subpopulation of all adults, and a population with great variation amongst itself. Contributors to this
variation include physiological differences attributable to marked variances in the aging process across
individuals that manifests as frailty or robustness, as well as differences that arise due to the degree of
multimorbidity, older adults’ preferences regarding interventions, and their ability to engage in self-care.
The second proposed set of projects will involve the development of methods and tools to help clinicians
to communicate more clearly with each other and with patients on this topic. With use of Design Thinking
methods and engagement of collaborators from our Department of Art as Applied to Medicine, I will
develop a framework and visual tools to assist with clear communication on this topic."

Optogenetics is a revolutionary technique in neuroscience. By combining light-sensitive proteins with intracranial
light delivery, optogenetics offers unprecedented, cell-type specific control over neuronal activity. The technique
has become the dominant approach for studying neural circuits in small animal models such as mice and flies.
Unfortunately, optogenetics has so far failed to have a major impact on research using larger animals more
similar to humans, such as macaque monkeys, undermining its translational potential for human patients. We
conducted a world-wide Open Science initiative to identify the challenges remaining to be solved in primate
optogenetics (Tremblay et al. Neuron, 2020). We identified the sheer size of the macaque monkey brain, which
is 200 times bigger than the mouse brain, as well as its immune system, as the main challenges for both gene
expression and light delivery. Our multidisciplinary team of investigators will overcome these obstacles by
developing and optimizing three new technologies: 1) large-scale, safe delivery of ultra-sensitive opsins using
gene therapy techniques; 2) chronically-implantable, ultra-thin, flexible, biocompatible LED arrays; and 3)
implantable, battery-powered LED drivers for wireless control during unrestrained, naturalistic behavior. This
approach will allow precise control of large volumes of the primate brain with cell-type specificity and millisecond
resolution in monkeys free of physical restraint, thus permitting causal dissection of the neural circuits mediating
natural behavior relevant for understanding and treating human brain disorders. This technology platform could
be directly applied as a cell-type-specific optogenetic therapy for humans suffering from neurological disorders
that affect specific neural populations, such as focal epilepsy."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias like frontotemporal dementia (FTD) disproportionately affect
Latinos and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Nevertheless, the bulk of the research exploring the
multifaceted biology of dementia, which includes both genetic and epigenetic aspects, has predominantly been
focused on Caucasian populations and higher-income countries (HICs). To address these disparities and expand
dementia research in Latin America countries (LAC) and low-income countries, our group has established the
NIH-NIA/Tau Consortium/Alzheimer Association funded Multi-Partner Consortium to Expand Dementia
Research in Latin America (ReDLat) cohort study of Latinos with AD, FTD, and healthy controls. ReDLat
represents a first-in-class dataset of Latinos with AD, FTD, and demographically matched healthy controls
consisting of biospecimen collection, standardized clinical, neuropsychological, genomic, neuroimaging, and
SDH data, which our research group has utilized to identify unique combinations of environmental and genetic
factors of dementia in Latin American Countries (LAC). Our preliminary epigenetic data reveals shared and
distinct epigenetic DNA methylation differences related to AD and FTD, including a ""Hispanic Paradox"" with
epigenetic biomarkers underestimating biological aging in Latinos despite AD and FTD diagnoses. Moreover,
our preliminary data harnessing matched SDH data from ReDLat suggests a link between altered DNAm states
of inflammatory, stress, and cardiometabolic genes and socioeconomic status. Our overall hypothesis is that
a social adversity-epigenetic signature in immune cells at regulatory regions of proinflammatory, stress, and
cardiometabolic genes associates with dementia presentation and heterogeneity in Latinos. In this proposal, we
test this overall hypothesis and add epigenetic DNAm data to the ReDLat cohort by (1) leveraging existing blood
biospecimens from 1,600 participants (n=400 AD, n=400 FTD, n=800 controls) with different social determinants
of health (SDH) levels, including a low-middle income country (Colombia), an upper middle-income country
(Argentina), and HICs countries (Chile and the US) and (2) leverage existing ongoing rolling ReDLat recruitment
to add an out-of-sample validation epigenetic dataset of 400 additional participants (n=100 AD, n=100 FTD, and
n=200 controls) to generate an epigenetic dataset from 2,000 total Latinos in ReDLat. With these rich epigenetic
data, we will identify shared and distinguishing epigenetic DNAm features associated with AD and FTD
presentation in Latinos. Moreover, we will utilize this extensive epigenetic dataset to better understand the
interactions between specific SDH factors and distinct epigenetic changes in the genome. Understanding
dementia presentation through the lens of epigenetics and SDH in Latinos across diverse regions of LAC and
the US will advance regionally-informed novel strategies to address dementia disparities by paving the way for
targeted interventions and prevention strategies that take into account both epigenetic and SDH factors."
10885474,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Parent mental health (MH) problems are an unaddressed barrier to effective treatment of pediatric feeding
disorder (PFD). PFD affects up to one-third of young children and is characterized by severely restricted volume
or variety of food intake. Many children do not respond to our most effective treatments, and addressing barriers
to effective treatment is critical to improving our ability to treat PFD. Without effective treatment, PFD can lead
to malnutrition and high healthcare utilization. Up to 40% of parents of children with PFD experience mental
health (MH) problems such as depression, anxiety, and parenting stress, which is far greater than rates in parents
of healthy children. Parent MH problems are associated with suboptimal child feeding practices and poor
adherence to treatment recommendations. Positive, non-coercive, parent-child mealtime interactions are
paramount to effective treatment of PFD. However, parent MH problems contribute to increased stress at meals
and parents often report having “battles” with their children over eating, rather than engaging in recommended
strategies. Despite the well-known impact of parent MH problems on effective PFD treatment, it is extremely rare
that parent MH is addressed in PFD care. No MH treatments have been tested with parents of children with PFD,
and there are no universal PFD standards of care to encourage or guide parent MH treatment implementation.
Without identifying an effective and efficient (i.e., brief) MH treatment for parents of children with PFD, our most
effective PFD treatments will continue to fail many children. Focused Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
(FACT) is ideal to address this gap, as it can be effective in just 1-2 sessions. In a recent study of FACT with
parents of children with neurodevelopmental disorders, parent depression and anxiety improved in 2-sessions,
and demonstrated downstream improvements in child behavior. The developers of FACT propose this treatment
effect likely occurs through psychological flexibility, which is associated with adaptive parenting behaviors (e.g.,
positive reinforcement, limit setting). However, the association between parent psychological flexibility and
parent-child mealtime interactions remains untested. The objective of this K23 study is to assess the efficacy of
a 2-session FACT intervention for parents of children with PFD. We hypothesize that FACT-PFD will be effective
in reducing parent MH problems, improving parent psychological flexibility, and improving parent-child mealtime
interactions. The proposed training will focus on clinical trial conduct and analysis, observational behavioral
coding, and implementation science. Results of this project have the potential to identify an effective parent MH
treatment and to launch the independent career of a highly promising junior scientist."
10885516,"Repetitive mild TBI (r-mTBI) can induce neurological impairment years after injury, increasing the risk for Alzheimer’s Disease
(AD). No suitable treatments have been developed to rescue the long-term consequences of TBI. Advancing our understanding of
the mechanisms driving the chronic effects of r-mTBI is critical, as this could lead to the identification of novel therapies. Microglia
mediated neuroinflammation is a common feature of TBI and AD. Experimental evidence suggests that neurodegeneration and
cognitive deficits are associated with the maladaptive transformation of microglia from an early neurorestorative phenotype to a
dysfunctional and chronically activated proinflammatory state. Factors governing the persistence of these neuroinflammatory
responses in the chronic sequelae of TBI remain elusive. We have established a WT mouse model that recapitulates many of the
features of human r-mTBI and thus represents a translationally relevant preclinical platform to interrogate these factors. Having
established this r-mTBI model (and given the role of tau as a pathognomonic lesion of TBI), we generated microglial transcriptomic
profiles in human Tau Knock In (TauKI) mice at a range of timepoints post-injury. Firstly, when we compared microglial responses
in TauKI vs WT mice, we revealed an increase in significant gene transcripts between r-mTBI and sham microglia by 3 to 9-fold at
chronic timepoints. In the TauKI model, we reveal deficits in bioenergetics, cytokine signaling, lipid metabolism, and a pro-
inflammatory signature of chronically activated microglia, which appear to be influenced by the activation of Phosphatase and
Tensin Homolog (PTEN) signaling, and this correlated with TBI dependent Tau pathology. PTEN is a lipid phosphatase that
antagonizes PI3K signaling, a critical node vital for regulating cell survival, energy bioenergetics and inflammation. PTEN is highly
expressed in myeloid cells, and its dysregulation can trigger the activation of neuroinflammatory responses. PTEN activation has
been reported to occur early in tauopathy models, and its inhibition, dampens microglial activation, reduces synaptic phagocytosis
by microglia, and preserves neuronal integrity. We thus hypothesize that PTEN activation is a mediator of chronically activated
microglia and their dysfunctional activities, and a driver of tau seeding and pathogenesis, such that genetic deletion of PTEN in
microglia will mitigate the deleterious effects of chronic microglial activation on tau pathology and long-term TBI outcomes. To
begin to address this, we developed a Cre-LoxP model that specifically deletes PTEN in myeloid cells between 2.5 to 3.5 mo post-
injury and revealed rescue of pro-inflammatory microglial responses after r-mTBI. In this new proposal, we plan to expand on
this work, using an improved tamoxifen inducible model on a human TauKI background that deletes PTEN signaling in microglia,
and not other myeloid cells. We will explore the optimal time-window of intervention (early vs delayed) and generate a detailed
longitudinal time-course of neurobehavior, microglial phenotype and function, tau seeding/pathogenesis and neuropathological
outcomes after r-mTBI. We will also use a single cell RNAseq mining approach to compare TBI-dependent responses in the
presence or absence of PTEN deletion to identify the distinctive states of microglia and reparative mechanisms that drives their
favorable outcomes. Our goal is to identify molecular mechanisms driving the transformation of chronic microglia into a
proinflammatory and neurotoxic phenotype that contribute to tauopathy, neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits, in order to
develop new and effective delayed therapeutic interventions for TBI and AD."
10885569,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Epilepsy is a devastating neurological disorder affecting 65 million people worldwide and more than 3 million
people in the United States. Seizures impairing consciousness severely affect quality of life of people with
epilepsy. However, the dysfunction in brain networks associated with these seizures is not fully understood.
Previous studies explored limited set of features that can partially explain the underlying network dysfunction.
Additionally, none of these studies investigated the association between ictal and interictal dysfunctional
network connectivity patterns. Recently, we studied EEG characteristics of seizures impairing consciousness
and developed a promising machine learning approach to predict impaired consciousness in absence epilepsy.
The current proposal extends more broadly to other seizure disorders and interictal cognitive deficits. My
central hypothesis is that seizures impairing consciousness are associated with both transient and chronic
dysfunction in the same networks and that the characteristics of the transient dysfunction can be leveraged to
develop a clinical tool to predict impaired consciousness during seizures based on scalp EEG without the need
for behavioral testing. To address this hypothesis, a large EEG dataset of seizures impairing and sparing
consciousness (impaired and spared seizures), as well as interictal recordings will be created. The
spatiotemporal and spectral characteristics of behaviorally impaired and spared seizures will be investigated
(Aim 1). A clinical tool based on conventional machine learning and deep learning methods will be developed
to predict impaired consciousness based on pre-ictal, ictal, and post-ictal EEG and transfer learning will be
used to enable model generalization across hospital settings (Aim 2). To characterize the relation between ictal
and interictal connectivity dysfunction, we will investigate functional and effective connectivity patterns in
relation to impairment during and between seizures (Aim 3). It is anticipated that spatiotemporal and spectral
analyses will reveal statistically significant differences between impaired and spared seizures during pre-ictal,
ictal, and post-ictal periods (Aim 1). We expect the developed clinical tool will be capable of predicting
impairment in consciousness regardless of seizure type and origin and will perform efficiently across different
hospital settings (Aim 2). Furthermore, the predictive models are expected to identify innovative information
about evolution and stability of neural representations underlying impaired and spared seizures (Aim 2).
Finally, we hypothesize that recurrent transient dysfunction in connectivity due to impaired seizures will be
associated with chronic connectivity dysfunction in the same networks (Aim 3). A detailed understanding of
transient and chronic network dysfunction associated with seizures may lead to development of novel
biomarkers and targets for therapeutic neuromodulation. Moreover, EEG-based prediction of the behavioral
impact of seizures may help guide clinical decisions about treatment including medication adjustment, surgery
or neurostimulation, and lifestyle factors such as driving safety."
10784909,"Externalizing disorders are highly heritable psychiatric conditions that typically present in childhood or
adolescence and co-occur within individuals. Recent genome-wide association studies have successfully
identified hundreds of genetic loci linked to externalizing disorders – many of which are known to be involved
in neurodevelopment. Bioinformatic results have bolstered this connection, revealing that the shared genetic
architecture of externalizing is enriched for genes that are preferentially expressed during the prenatal period.
However, despite these important advances, our understanding of the precise neurodevelopmental
mechanisms involved remains limited. Identifying the specific processes that augment the risk for and
development of externalizing psychopathology would greatly advance translational knowledge in this domain.
In this application, Dr. Travis Mallard will investigate the central hypothesis that externalizing psychopathology
is influenced by genes involved in critical neurodevelopmental programs that partially exert their influence via
subtle-but-deleterious effects on cortical structure. Specifically, Dr. Mallard will use the Genomic Structural
Equation Modeling framework to advance genetic discovery for externalizing disorders (Aim 1), and elucidate
the genetic relationships between externalizing and brain structure across development (Aim 2). Using cutting-
edge informatic methods, he will then characterize the multidimensional functional profiles of risk genes (Aim
3). These studies will use existing large-scale neurogenomic and clinical datasets and advanced statistical
methods that the applicant and his mentorship team have pioneered. Together, these aims will help clarify the
complex molecular underpinnings and developmental neurogenomic pathways in externalizing disorders.
With his unique background in clinical psychology, complex trait genetics, and human neuroscience, Dr.
Mallard is well-qualified to execute the proposed research and training objectives. The four-year training
program will foster the applicant’s technical skillset, professional development, and progression toward
independence, and the proposed studies will generate vital preliminary data for a future R01 application with
therapeutic potential. Dr. Mallard will continue his mentee relationships with Drs. Jordan Smoller and Tian Ge,
while receiving training and mentorship in functional genomics and transcriptomics from Dr. Michael Gandal.
He has also enlisted several additional renowned clinical scientists to serve on his Expert Advisory Committee:
Dr. Danielle Dick, an expert in the genetic etiology of externalizing disorders; Dr. Elliot Tucker-Drob, a
statistical genetics and cognitive development expert; and Dr. Armin Raznahan, an expert in developmental

To cure age-related diseases is of critical importance for the life quality of elderly people. One promising strategy
is to slow down aging or reverse aging with regenerative medicine. However, the regenerative capacity of stem
cells and their supportive microenvironments are drastically impaired in old age. Hence, to rejuvenate functions
of aged adult stem cells and their microenvironments or to maintain the youthful functions of adult stem cells in
old age are critical research directions to empower regenerative medicine to fight age-associated diseases. Here,
we propose to use a cutting-edge spatial transcriptomics method, Seq-Scope, to comprehensively examine the
aging, regeneration and rejuvenation of eye progenitor cells and their niche cells in the sexual planarians, a
champion of tissue regeneration. We aim to determine the molecular pathways that facilitate regeneration and
rejuvenation in old age. The proposed experiments will define datasets of fundamental importance in the
identification of niche cells and changes in aging and regeneration that will fuel long-term mechanistic studies."
10798426,"Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL), derived from mature T cells, are aggressive malignancies for which
existing therapies are suboptimal, as the median overall survival of patients with relapsed/refractory disease is
<6 months. These dismal outcomes are explained, at least in part, by an intrinsic resistance to conventional
chemotherapeutic approaches and a poor understanding of recurrent, and therapeutically targetable,
oncogenic drivers. Despite their genetic and molecular heterogeneity, most PTCL remain dependent upon their
microenvironment, as constituents of the tumor microenvironment (TME) promote the growth, survival, and
chemotherapy resistance of malignant T cells through trophic factors. Therefore, improved understanding of
the trophic factors available to PTCL within the TME, and the cells that provide them, may unveil novel
therapeutic strategies.
Notch signaling, triggered by ligands presented by non-hematopoietic stromal cells, plays a critically important
role in the development, differentiation, and function of conventional (non-malignant) T cells. Utilizing relevant
and complementary genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models and primary PTCL specimens, we have
discovered that Notch activation is highly recurrent in PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS). When
activated, Notch signaling is associated with significant transcriptional reprogramming, PTCL proliferation, and
a TME rich in fibroblastic reticular cells (FRC), which are specialized stromal cells required for the presentation
of Notch ligands to conventional T cells in secondary lymphoid organs. Our preliminary data, utilizing
complementary pharmacologic (i.e. antibody-based, and thus clinically translatable) and genetic approaches
demonstrate that Notch signaling is an oncogenic driver in PTCL. Therefore, our overall objective in this
application, bolstered by our preliminary data, is to identify the oncogenic Notch ligand(s) and the stromal cells
that present them, and further characterize the transcriptional programs that they instigate, in PTCL. This
objective will be achieved by addressing our central hypothesis that non-mutational, stromal cell- and ligand-
dependent Notch signaling is a significant and therapeutically targetable oncogenic driver in mature T-cell
lymphomas."

Smoking is associated with a variety of adverse health effects, including increased postoperative wound
healing time, wound infections, and cardiovascular complications among surgery patients. The associations
between pre-operative smoking cessation and improved surgical outcomes have led surgeons and hospitals to
implement policies that require patients to quit smoking prior to elective surgeries. Given the high rate of
smoking among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations and the even higher rate among Medicaid-
insured surgery patients, these policies will disproportionately impact patients of lower socioeconomic status
(SES). In 2017, Oregon implemented the first statewide policy in the United States that requires Medicaid-
insured patients to quit smoking prior to a broad range of elective surgeries as a condition of payment for
surgery by the state Medicaid program. This policy creates an opportune time to assist patients in quitting
smoking pre-surgery (i.e., a “teachable moment”) and to support continued abstinence during post-operative
visits; thus, this policy could result in higher rates of cessation assistance and cessation among patients of
lower SES, potentially mitigating long-standing smoking-related disparities and providing support for
implementation of similar policies among payers and health care systems. That said, some suggest that if
patients do not receive cessation assistance and are denied surgery because they were unable to quit, these
policies will exacerbate already existing smoking- and surgery-related disparities among those who are
socioeconomically disadvantaged. The impact of these policies on smoking- and surgery-related outcomes
among patients of lower SES are unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we will conduct a quasi-
experimental study using a sequential mixed methods design. We will link electronic health record (EHR) data
to Medicaid claims from 148 Oregon community health centers (CHCs) to examine changes in smoking-
(cessation assistance and quit rates) and surgery- (rates of surgery and surgery complications) related
outcomes among patients seeking elective orthopedic surgeries between 1/1/2014-12/31/2016 (pre-policy) and
1/1/2017-12/31/2019 (post-policy implementation). Informed by our quantitative analyses, we will conduct
semi-structured interviews with health care leaders, primary care clinicians, orthopedic surgeons, and patients,
and survey Care Coordination Organization leaders to explore organizational workflows and protocols related
to this policy (e.g., increased cessation assistance), and perceptions and experiences of the policy on intended
and unintended consequences. This innovative study will provide rigorous, actionable evidence to inform
states and policy makers of the extent to which this policy results in the desired changes."
10800670,"Both intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and fetal overgrowth increase the risk for perinatal complications
and predispose the individual for developing obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease in childhood and
adult age. Thus, a mechanistic understanding of the regulation of fetal growth is critical for identifying the
causes of major pregnancy complications and developmental programming of adult disease. Placental mTOR signaling is inhibited in IUGR and activated in pregnancies complicated by fetal overgrowth. Trophoblast mTOR signaling responds to an array of diverse maternal nutritional and metabolic signals. For example, trophoblast mTOR is activated by insulin/IGF-I, glucose and amino acids, fatty acids and folate, and inhibited by cortisol, adiponectin, infection and reduced uteroplacental blood flow. In addition, mTOR is a positive regulator of trophoblast amino acid and folate transport and mitochondrial respiration. Collectively, this data suggest that trophoblast mTOR signaling functions as a critical hub linking maternal nutrient supply to placental function, fetal growth and developmental programming. However, data demonstrating that changes in trophoblast mTOR signaling directly regulates placental function in vivo, causes abnormal fetal growth and programs adult disease is lacking, representing a major gap in knowledge and a roadblock for future targeting of trophoblast mTOR signaling to mitigate IUGR and fetal overgrowth. Our central hypothesis is that inhibition of trophoblast mTOR signaling is mechanistically linked to decreased placental nutrient transport and mitochondrial respiration, fetal growth restriction and impaired fetal pancreatic isletcell function. Our approach will be to use gene targeting in cultured primary human trophoblast (PHT) cells and a trophoblast specific inducible mTOR knockdown mouse that we have recently developed. In Aim 1 we will determine the mechanistic role of trophoblast mTOR signaling in the regulation of placental function and fetal growth. We hypothesize that (1) restoring normal mTOR signaling rescues the phenotype in PHT cells isolated from IUGR pregnancies and that (2) trophoblast-specific mTOR knockdown in mice decreases placental nutrient transport and mitochondrial respiration and inhibits fetal growth. In Aim 2, we will establish the mechanistic role of trophoblast mTOR signaling in regulating fetal islet function Our working hypothesis is that inhibition of trophoblast mTOR signaling inhibits fetal islet function mediated by exosomal miRNAs released into the fetal circulation. The proposed work is significant because it will generate novel mechanistic information leading to a better understanding of the underpinnings of abnormal fetal growth and in utero programming of metabolic disease, which will have a sustained and significant impact on the field. The proposed work is innovative because the trophoblast specific inducible mTOR knockout mouse, generated using piggyBac transposon mediated transgenesis, represents the first mouse model with inducible trophoblast specific gene targeting."
10800672,"PROJECT SUMMARY
RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis provides a critical means to understand gene functions. High-throughput
RNA-Seq data are frequently measured under multiple conditions from the same set of samples. For example,
in the NIH Common Fund’s Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, samples from different tissues are
collected from each post-mortem donor for sequencing. For another study on ultraviolet (UV) radiation, skin
keratinocytes from the same set of subjects are exposed to different radiation doses and durations before
sequencing. Such common-sample, multi-condition RNA-Seq data have information shared across both
samples and conditions, and have the potential to provide key insights into gene functions. However, despite
great endeavors to collect such data, there is a lack of analytical methods and computational tools to maximize
their potential. Important tasks such as missing data imputation, functional gene module identification and
association analysis remain unaddressed. In this proposal, we will build an innovative and powerful paradigm
to analyze multi-condition RNA-Seq data and thus improve our understanding of gene functions. To leverage
information across conditions, samples and genes simultaneously, we propose to model RNA-Seq data as
multi-way tensor arrays. We will develop novel tensor methods and theory that are appropriate for read count
data. In particular, our first aim is to extend tensor completion methods for block-wise missing RNA-Seq data
imputation. By modeling unobserved samples as missing blocks in a tensor, we will aggregate information
along different modes (subjects, conditions, genes) to impute missing values. The second aim develops
flexible tensor co-clustering methods, which simultaneously cluster genes, samples and conditions, for co-
expressed gene module identification. The third aim is to build new tensor response regression models to
associate gene modules with genotype and covariates which will provide insights into genetic regulation such
as expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Finally, in the fourth aim, we will develop scalable statistical
software to implement the proposed methods and make them more broadly applicable. We will apply the
methods to the GTEx multi-tissue data and UV multi-condition data, and gain novel insights into gene
expression and regulation. The proposed research will likely transform how we analyze multi-condition RNA-
Seq data and enhance our understanding of human genomics and its relation to public health."
10800798,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Polarized cells in retain their shape in every cell cycle and this is essential to their proper function. Anomalies
in polarized cell shape can result in cancer, metabolic disorders, and loss of tissue integrity. Here, we will
investigate a long-standing question of how cells consistently regain their polarity after each round of division.
This investigation will be conducted using the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe model system that
provides many well characterized genetic tools to manipulate conserved proteins that influence cell shape
following division. Cdc42 is the major regulator of polarized growth. In fission yeast, cells halt polarized Cdc42
activation and consequent growth at the cell ends during mitosis. After completion of division, these cell ends
resume Cdc42 activation and cell growth. After division, Cdc42 activation and polarized growth always
resumes in a monopolar manner from the old end that pre-exists from the previous generation. The cell
transitions to bipolar growth when Cdc42 activation also resumes at the newly formed cell end in the G2 phase
of the cell cycle. Our preliminary data indicate that resumption of Cdc42 activation at the old end after division
and transition to bipolar activation in G2 are cell cycle dependent. Our central hypothesis is that Cdc42 is
differentially regulated at the cell ends by distinct cell-cycle-dependent cues to establish the cell polarization
pattern. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims, [1] Determine how Cdc42
activation resumes at the cell ends in the G1/S phase; [2] Elucidate how a memory of growth from the previous
cell cycle enables the pre-existing old end to initiate Cdc42 activation first; [3] Explain how the transition from
monopolar to bipolar growth occur in G2 phase. With this project we expect to mechanistically understand how
Cdc42 activation and associated growth patterns are modulated in different cell cycle stages. We will examine
how signals from one cell cycle inform the growth pattern in the next generation. This will provide much needed
insights into the principles that preserve polarized cell shape in complex systems. Due to the conserved nature
of the proteins involved in this investigation, we expect that our findings will be relevant cell shape control in
higher eukaryotes and provide potential therapeutic or diagnostic targets for diseases such as cancer."

Wood’s lamp examination of any patient will reveal Cutibacterium acnes, the microbe associated with acne. This
technique excites C. acnes porphyrins. It is not known how or why they are secreted, but they cause inflammation
and can bind metals. Light therapy can excite porphyrins to kill C. acnes and temporarily improve acne.
Isotretinoin is a non-antimicrobial acne treatment that increases healthy skin microbes and human proteins that
limit metals. My K08 project will test the hypothesis that these proteins select for healthy skin microbes. We
believe that our findings will lead to new therapies that cultivate (rather than kill) microbes to cure disease.
Candidate. I have been training to be a physician scientist since my senior year of high school in 1997. During
my M.D.-Ph.D., I studied immunology and used structure-function studies to dissect host-pathogen interactions.
This training led me to dermatology where I can see the immune system at work in every rash. As a resident, I
conducted a human study assessing how microbes change in acne remission. I published these findings and
they now support my proposed K08 mechanistic studies. My career goal is to run a translational research lab
that studies how interactions between humans and microbes impact skin disease. My K08 work will build the
scientific foundation for this work and provide the skills that I need to transition to independence.
Environment. With exceptional researchers, collegiality, and career development resources, Washington
University School of Medicine (WUSM) is an ideal institution for a K08 award, where I will attend frequent
scientific meetings, career development seminars, and didactics to prepare myself for a tenure-track position.
My mentor (Dr. Jeffrey Henderson) is a world-expert in using mass spectrometry(MS)-based metabolomics to
study human-microbe competition over metals. He has multiple NIH grants supporting these types of studies
and has extensive expertise using MS and biochemical approaches to study metal and heme metabolism.
WUSM is an exceptional place to pursue medical research and that is why I joined the WUSM faculty in 2017.
Research. Human skin uses microbial, physical, and secreted barriers to prevent infection. Secreted proteins
can limit metals, but their role in this system is unclear. It is also unclear how the normal skin microbe C. acnes
acquires metals or why it secretes porphyrins, which can bind metals (e.g. heme) and cause inflammation. Light
therapy activates porphyrins to kill C. acnes and temporarily improve acne. A non-antimicrobial drug (isotretinoin)
can cure acne. It increases healthy skin microbes and human proteins that limit metals. I hypothesize that
human proteins limit metals to select for healthy skin microbes. I will test this hypothesis by identifying C.
acnes pathways enriched by isotretinoin and determining if C. acnes uses porphyrins or RoxP to acquire metals."
10798447,"From mouse to man, traumatic injuries to the joint cause inflammation and, when the instigating injury remains
uncorrected, persistent inflammation culminates in irreversible degradation of all joint structures. In companion
animals, such as dogs, cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) disease is one of the most common causes of lameness
and is the leading cause of degenerative changes in the stifle joint. A number of therapies have been developed
to treat inflammation associated with persistent joint pain, including direct joint injections of non-steroidal anti-
inflammatories and intra-articular (IA) glucocorticoid and systemically delivered biologic therapies, among others.
However, most IA therapeutics are rapidly cleared from the joint via the synovium within 24-48 hours. To sustain
drug delivery in the mechanically loaded joint, our team recently developed a novel delivery system based on
PLGA microparticles that are designed to rupture under specific mechanical loading parameters (MAMCs). Our
data show that biologic therapies (including receptor antagonists such as IL-1Ra) can be encapsulated at high
efficiency and release active factors through both mechanically induced rupture and/or passive degradation of
the MAMCs. When injected into a minipig synovial joint, empty MAMCs are well tolerated, and progressively
release their contents over a two-week period. While promising, this technology has not yet been extensively
evaluated in a naturally occurring spontaneous injury model. In this proposal, we will first (Aim 1) develop
MAMCs delivering the clinical formulation of IL-1Ra (AnakinraTM) and test their efficacy in attenuating
inflammatory signaling in canine synovial tissue organ culture. Next, we will assess this technology in client
owned canines subsequent to presentation of CCL injury and compare the safety and efficacy of IA IL-1Ra
MAMCs to both systemic and IA delivery of unencapsulated soluble IL-1Ra . In these dogs, as well as humans
with ACL injuries, several weeks generally pass between the timing of knee injury and the surgical repair, during
which time inflammatory factors are present in the joint. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that sustained release of
anti-inflammatory therapeutics after injury, but before surgical repair, will better limit joint inflammation and
improve patient recovery after surgical repair when compared to systemic or IA delivery of unencapsulated
soluble IL-1Ra. Successful completion of this study will advance a new technology towards human clinical
implementation and validate, for the first time, the safety and therapeutic efficacy of MAMC-delivered IL-1Ra in
a pilot clinical trial (executed through the PennVet Veterinary Clinical Investigation Center) in client owned
canines. These pilot data will set the stage for subsequent larger and longer lasting clinical trials, as well as
application of this novel drug delivery platform to other injury scenarios in which quelling inflammation improves
long term outcomes."

Phrase Health is a clinical decision support (CDS) analytics company that empowers health systems to
efficiently incorporate scientific knowledge into high value clinical care through iterative, data-driven
improvements. CDS is a process for enhancing health‐related decisions and actions with pertinent, organized
clinical knowledge and patient information. While CDS has improved outcomes in sickle cell disease,
myocardial infarction, and many other diseases, its impact has been inconsistent. Continuous evaluation of
CDS is critical to achieve consistent improvement in outcomes, but evaluating CDS is burdensome for health
systems and often not performed. To address these challenges, Phrase Health developed a product called
Outcomes that offers a self-service guided walkthrough for quality improvement (QI) advocates of variable
experience levels to (1) rigorously evaluate the impact of CDS on clinical outcomes and (2) convert data-driven
insights into action. The approach has early market traction with advanced technical users. However, user
feedback cites a need for “out of the box” QI templates (defined as abstracted definitions for CDS
interventions, cohorts, measures, and their associations) to provide more structure and guidance. To address
this market demand, we will generate a library of “out of the box” QI templates accessible to Outcomes
customers for select lung diseases.
 In Aim 1, we will translate two QI project templates already established by partner systems within our platform:
(1) emergency management of asthma and (2) emergency management of bronchiolitis. These QI project
templates will be iteratively improved based on user feedback and then assessed for different measures of
value.
In Aim 2, we will use our authoring platform to develop two de novo projects: (1) emergency management
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and (2) ambulatory chronic management of asthma in patients
≥12 years old. Like Aim 1, these will be iteratively improved based on user feedback and then assessed for
value. We will additionally calculate the time and costs associated with developing a de novo QI project
template using our authoring platform.
At the end of this project, we will have demonstrated a library of “out of the box” QI templates focused on a
varied set of lung diseases, but also assessed the necessary investments required to scale to a larger QI
library. These data will begin to address the market’s demand for an “out of the box” library of QI templates and
quantify future investment needs, allowing us to commercialize and accelerate the translation of knowledge
into better health outcomes and support improved health system profitability in a value-based reimbursement
environment."

Regio- and stereo-specific methylation of natural products and synthetic pharmaceuticals can
dramatically improve their physiochemical, biological, and pharmacological properties.
Biocatalytic methylations are currently limited by the availability of efficient, scalable regeneration
systems for the cofactor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM). We propose a universal in vitro
platform for the regeneration of SAM using only methionine and ribose as inexpensive
feedstocks. Efficient, low-cost SAM regeneration bridges the gap between small scale high-
throughput screening of methyltransferases for novel methylated products and industrial
production of lead compounds, which is hampered by the availability of large amounts of SAM.
Invizyne has developed a bench-scale, enzyme-based, proof-of-concept SAM regeneration
system called SimpleSAM that is able to efficiently convert luteolin to chrysoreriol. In Phase I of
this project we will i) optimize this enzyme cascade for longevity, stability, SAM turnover numbers
and product yield, ii) expand the system to include C-, N-, and O-methylated targets of interest
and iii) replace the currently inefficient ATP regeneration system with a new cell-free cascade to
regenerate ATP from low-cost feedstock. The resulting GlyCoSAM platform will expand the
current toolkit for sustainable cell-free biomanufacturing and enable the scalable production
of methylated natural products, nutraceuticals, and synthetic pharmaceuticals."
10821556,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Spinal cord injury (SCI) is estimated to affect between 249,000 and 363,000 Americans, with about 17,730
new injuries occurring each year. There are around 42000 SCI patients that are veterans in the United States.
Nearly half of all SCIs occur in patients between the ages of 16 and 36, which results in individuals living with
SCI for decades. The lifetime costs of living with spinal cord injury can average up to $5.1M per patient for
individuals with high tetraplegia. So far, there are no FDA approved drug therapeutics for SCI, which highlights
a huge unmet medical need for those patients. Most spinal cord injuries are anatomically incomplete, which means
by reestablishing neural circuits in the spinal cord, those patients would have functional recovery potential. To
initiate the recovery process, injured axons from the remaining neurons above or near the injury level need to
regenerative growth to bypass the lesion site, reconnect to the neurons below the injury level, and then reestablish
the neural circuits. The major obstruction that prevents axon regrowth is the chemical and physical barriers that
accumulated at the lesion site quickly after injury, which blocks the axonal regenerative growth. For instance,
when axons regrowth to the lesion site, the Wnts protein reinduced there will interact with Ryk receptor that
reinduced on the axons, and then stop axon regeneration. To remove this obstruction, the interactions between
Ryk receptor and Wnts protein must be blocked.
 Advanced from the first-in-class research conducted in a world-famous research group in the University
of California, San Diego (UCSD), we developed a novel humanized monoclonal antibody drug candidate,
VersaMab-101, which could block the interaction between Wnt and the Ryk receptor. After injection into rats
with spinal cord injury, this antibody promoted axons regenerative growth and bypass the lesion site by stopping
the toxic interaction between Ryk and Wnts. The re-established neural circuits would then promote functional
recovery in rats.
 This novel therapeutic will benefits the patients with acute spinal cord injury by promoting axon
regeneration and improving their behavior recovery. This therapeutic will also benefit the whole community by
reducing the cost of long-term care. According to FDA recommendations in our pre-IND meeting, we propose to
conduct GLP-complaint toxicity study in non-human primates in this grant application to evaluate the VersaMab-
101 safety profiles."
10825211,"Our long-term goal is to understand the cellular and molecular basis of immunological memory in humans. We
will address this important question in Project 1 by doing a detailed analysis of both humoral and cellular immunity
in a longitudinal cohort of over > 700 COVID-19 patients that we have been following for the past three years
and will now follow for another five years. These patients were recruited at our two clinical sites located in Atlanta
(Emory University) and Seattle (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center). This combined cohort consists of individuals
who were first infected with SARS-CoV-2 and then got the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccine, and some
individuals who received the vaccine first and then got infected. Many of these individuals have then gotten
booster shots with the vaccine and several of them have also had additional breakthrough infections. During this
three-year period of multiple antigen encounters of various combinations of infection and vaccination, we have
collected between 5-10 longitudinal blood samples from each patient. We now propose to follow these patients
for another five years and will collect 3-4 samples per year from each patient. Thus, we will have 20-30
longitudinal blood samples from each patient over an 8-year period. In addition, in the next five years we will also
collect bone marrow aspirates and mucosal samples from a subset of these individuals. The Specific Aims of

10822403,"Project Summary:
 Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is routinely used in protein and nanoparticle therapeutics, with dozens of
PEGylated drugs approved to date. Although PEG itself is exceptionally safe, patients can form high titers of
anti-PEG antibodies (APA) to some PEGylated drugs. This results not only in loss of efficacy from APA-
induced rapid clearance of the drug, but also increases the risks of severe allergic responses, as exemplified
by adverse clinical experiences with Krystexxa, Oncaspar and Palynziq that leave tens of thousands of
Americans without viable treatments. Furthermore, APA induced by one drug can impact the efficacy and
safety of a second PEGylated drug. Given the increasing number of PEGylated drugs on the market (including
COVID-19 mRNA vaccines), there is an urgent need for safe and effective interventions that prevent APA
induction and PEG-allergy.
 Mucommune has in-licensed a technology that can safely and effectively overcome the impact of APA
on PEGylated medicines, without the need for broad immunosuppression or new polymers to replace PEG.
The technology is based on the use of high MW free PEG to competitively saturate circulating APA and B-cell
receptors on the surface of APA+ B-cells, thereby limiting the “hapten” effect of PEG-drugs. In published and
pilot studies, free PEG markedly suppresses APA-induction against PEG-liposomes and Krystexxa (PEG-
uricase) in immunocompetent mice and swine, and effectively restored the prolonged circulation of both in
animals with high APA titers. Importantly, repeated injection of free PEG does not simulate further APA
induction, unlike PEG-proteins or PEG-liposomes. Perhaps most surprisingly, free PEG completely eliminated
hypersensitive reactions to PEG-liposomes in swine (the gold standard model for PEG-induced pseudoallergy).
Swine receiving PEG-liposomes alone experienced strong anaphylaxis requiring immediate epinephrine
intervention and resuscitation. These findings strongly underscore the promise of using free PEG to overcome
allergic response to PEGylated medicines and to restore their efficacious use.
 Free PEG is inexpensive (pennies per dose), offers outstanding safety, and can be rapidly advanced
into late stage clinical studies. Our overarching goal in this Phase 1 SBIR proposal is to establish the
foundation to quickly advance this intervention into the clinic. We will file a pre-IND (Type B) application with
the FDA to confirm the suitability of our proposed preclinical and clinical pathway, and will develop and qualify
key assays for quantifying APA and free PEG necessary to support GLP and future clinical studies. We will
then execute a GLP tox study in rats (a common model for PEG-drugs) to support first-in-human studies.
Successful completion of these activities will allow us to file IND for MM010, putting us at the doorstep of
advancing this intervention into the clinic, potentially providing relief for the tens of thousands of Americans
suffering from responses to PEG-drugs that limit their use of essential treatments."
10822404,"Abstract. Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bpm) is a facultative intracellular bacterium that is the causative agent
of melioidosis. Bpm is a CDC Tier 1 Select agent, which a biological agent that has been determined to have
the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety. NIAID classifies Bpm as a Category B
pathogen, which is a pathogen that provides the highest risk to national security and public health due to its
ease of dissemination, high mortality rate, and potential use as a bioterrorism weapon. There are no approved
treatments or vaccines to protect against acute or chronic Bpm infection, and the genus is resistant to most
antibiotics. Thus, there is an urgent need for new medicines to treat Bpm infection. Vaccines in general require
at least 10 days for subjects to develop immunity and thus are not useful for treating newly infected patients or
protecting non-vaccinated healthcare providers and first responders in an emergency outbreak situation. A
concern for both vaccines and antibiotics is that resistant Bpm strains may develop through random or directed
mutation such as for a bioweapon. An alternative and potentially synergistic approach for protecting against
Bpm infection is to stimulate the innate arm of the host immune system to resist infection. Interferon gamma
(IFN-) is a critical component of the innate immune system and has been shown to be absolutely required for
protection from Bpm lethality. IFN- quickly (within hours) activates host cells to resist infection by Bpm and
other deadly facultative intracellular bacteria such as Tularemia, protozoa like toxoplasma, and viruses like
Ebola. Thus, IFN- has the potential to be an effective broad-spectrum treatment against several deadly
bioterrorism threats. However, IFN- has a very short in vivo half-life, poor bioavailability, and requires
intraperitoneal (ip) injection to reach protective plasma levels in mice, which limit the protein's utility as a Bpm
therapeutic. Subcutaneous (sc) dosing of IFN- results in ~ 10-fold lower plasma levels and greatly reduced in
efficacy. We created site-specific PEGylated human and mouse IFN- analogs (PEG IFN-) that have superior
bioavailability and > 20-fold longer half-lives than IFN- following sc dosing. The PEG murine IFN- homolog
proved significantly more efficacious than mIFN- at improving survival from Ebola virus infection following sc
injection in mice. We hypothesize PEG-IFN- also will be significantly more effective than IFN- at preventing
morbidity and mortality from Bpm infection when administered by sc injection and will test this hypothesis by
evaluating efficacy of PEG mIFN- and mIFN- using a well characterized murine Bpm infection model. These
studies will lead to a fast-acting treatment that confers protection within hours and which can be administered
easily by sc injection to patients who recently contracted Bpm, as well as potentially to first responders and
healthcare providers in an emergency outbreak situation. Utilizing the host innate immune system and its
myriad anti-microbial pathways to combat deadly pathogens like Bpm greatly reduces the likelihood that drug
resistance may develop through genetic mutational escape mechanisms, either natural or man-made."

 “Designer drugs” burst onto the United States (US) recreational drug market in early 2009. By 2011, “bath salts,”
which are most often mixtures of synthetic cathinones and other drugs such as caffeine, were linked to numerous press
reports of bizarre and violent behavior, and accounted for well over 20,000 emergency room visits. Over the nearly 10
years since their introduction, the number of synthetic cathinones available for use has grown from 3 (MDPV,
methylone, and mephedrone) to over 140. Based on work from our lab and others, we now know that the reinforcing
effects of cathinones exist on a continuum, with drugs such as methylone functioning as relatively modest reinforcers
(cocaine>methylone), and drugs such as MDPV, and α-PVP functioning as exceptionally powerful reinforcers capable of
maintaining significantly greater levels of responding than either cocaine or methamphetamine. In addition evidence to
show that the reinforcing effectiveness of cocaine and synthetic cathinones, such as MDPV and α-PVP, is directly related
to their selectivity for DAT over SERT, our laboratory has also shown that these reinforcing (and toxic) effects can be
synergistically enhanced when drugs such as MDPV and methylone are administered in combination with other “bath
salts” constituents, such as caffeine.
 In the last 5 years, we have learned a great deal about the pharmacology and abuse-related effects of synthetic
cathinones; however, over this same time the synthetic drug market and the landscape of recreational drug use more
broadly have changed dramatically. In 2013, heroin began to supplant prescription opioids as opioid users’ drug of
choice; by 2014, synthetic opioids, mainly fentanyl, had flooded the market. These changes coincided with a doubling of
the incidence of opioid-related deaths, from ~25,000 in 2013 to >47,000 in 2017, over half of which (~28,000) were
linked to synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl. Over this same time, overdose deaths related to stimulants (e.g., cocaine,
methamphetamine and synthetic cathinones), have more than doubled over the same time from fewer than 10,000 in
2013, to over 24,000 in 2017. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly clear that these two phenomena are not occurring in
isolation, with ~50% of opioid-related deaths involving stimulants, and ~50% of stimulant-related deaths also involving
opioids. Thus, the US is in the midst of a polysubstance abuse epidemic, the effects of which are increasing at an
exponential rate. This research project aims to 1) determine the impact of self-administration of α-PVP during
adolescence on the development of compulsive drug taking and vulnerability to opioid abuse later in life; 2) characterize
the interactions between the abuse-related and toxic effects of stimulants and opioids; and 3) examine the degree to
which opioid dependence and withdrawal impact the nature of the interactions between the abuse-related and toxic
effects of mixtures of stimulants and opioids. Together, these studies will provide essential information about the
complexities associated with the co-use of multiple substances from different pharmacological classes that will advance
efforts to develop novel and effective treatments for abuse-related and toxic effects of polysubstance abuse."

 The goal of this K08 is to prepare the PI, to receive hands-on experience in implementation
and dissemination, designing and leading randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in palliative care,
and improve grant writing skills to become an independent R01-funded investigator.
Hispanic/Latinx (H/L) communities experience disparate general health outcomes and are more
likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer when compared to non-H/L populations. H/L patients
experiencing advanced cancer and their caregivers are at an increased risk for unmet
psychosocial needs; this K08 will allow the PI to focus on this important gap in minority health
care. The research goal of this proposal is to refine and pilot an intervention titled: Caregivers
Patients Support to Latinx Coping with Advanced Cancer (CASA), a five-session, 60-minute each
telehealth series for patient-caregiver dyads. The long-term training goal of this application is
to enable the applicant (PI) to become an independent investigator as a cultural adaptation expert
on psychosocial interventions in health disparity research. The rationale for this project is that it
will lay the groundwork for a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) testing the efficacy of CASA. It will
also assess the implementation of an innovative method to deliver the CASA intervention. This
study aims to use the collaborative intervention planning framework and ORBIT model to modify
and assess the feasibility and preliminary effect of the CASA intervention. The overall impact of
this study is to improve access to psychosocial, culturally adapted interventions among H/L
patients and caregivers coping with advanced cancer. The Specific Aims are as follows:
Aim 1. Use a collaborative intervention planning framework with providers and community
stakeholders to refine study procedures prior to the implementation of a pilot randomized
controlled trial.
Aim 2: To train community members as patient recruiters and clinical psychology doctoral
students as interventionists of the CASA intervention.
Aim 3: To implement a pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability,
and potential efficacy of the CASA intervention with Hispanic/Latinx dyads coping with cancer."
10807723,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of a novel approach to ameliorating cognitive
deficits in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD). SCD is an understudied, life-limiting disease
affecting 100,000 individuals in the United States and over 300,000 newborns globally every year. Youth with
SCD are at substantial neurological risk given their increased likelihood of overt stroke and silent cerebral infarct.
However, even individuals without signs of cerebral infarct exhibit lower cognitive performance compared to
healthy siblings due in large part to non-stroke, disease effects on the central nervous system. Disease-related
cognitive issues are diffuse but often affect working memory function. Very few studies have examined
therapeutic approaches to treating cognitive deficits in SCD; however, recent research supports the use of a
home-based, eHealth working memory training program (Cogmed). In a randomized controlled trial, Cogmed
training (i.e., repeated and adaptive working memory skills practice) resulted in improved working memory but
adherence to the intervention was low. Early engagement with the training program emerged as predictive of
better adherence. Therefore, in an effort to promote engagement, an enhanced version of the program was
developed that incorporates social support components (e.g., multifamily Cogmed Kickoff events, social
incentives, peer navigator support) and memory strategy training. The study will evaluate the following specific
aims in a single-arm pilot clinical trial: 1) Assess the feasibility of Cogmed+ (Cogmed plus social support
components and memory strategy training) in youth with SCD; and 2) Determine the effect of Cogmed+ on rates
of treatment adherence. In this study, 50 youth ages 7-16 with SCD will complete a cognitive screening, after
which 30 participants with working memory deficits will proceed to the Cogmed+ program. Participants will
complete Cogmed on a tablet device from home 3-5 times per week for 5-8 weeks. Participants will attend weekly
videoconference calls with a Cogmed coach who will review training progress and teach memory strategies
during four coaching calls (weeks 2-5). Outcomes will be assessed by examining the number of Cogmed
sessions completed and rates of attendance to Cogmed Kickoff events and memory strategy training sessions.
Results will also be compared to a historical comparison group of youth with SCD who completed the basic
version of Cogmed. Findings will provide critical data regarding a novel strategy for improving access to an
efficacious treatment for youth with SCD. If such an augmented approach proves beneficial, resultant data will
inform a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a stepped care model that selectively delivers
more intensive Cogmed treatment packages only as needed. This line of investigation, which balances practical
access and resource considerations, could serve as a scalable care model and ignite efforts to address SCD-
related cognitive impairment for the millions of people living with SCD globally."

Black adults in the U.S. have a disproportionately higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias
(ADRD) compared with non-Hispanic White adults. Disparities in cardiometabolic risk factors and diseases and
social determinants of health (such as educational access, stress due to discrimination, neighborhood factors,
and others) likely contribute to this disparity, but exact mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesize that
inflammation may be a key feature linking cardiometabolic and social determinants of health disparities with
the risk of incident cognitive impairment and dementia. We propose to test this hypothesis through systemic
analysis of the circulating proteome with risk of incident cognitive impairment and trajectories of cognitive
function in a large biracial population from the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke
(REGARDS) study. REGARDS is a longitudinal cohort of 30,239 non-Hispanic Black and White adults across
the contiguous U.S. with pre-existing genome-wide genotyping data and rich cardiovascular and
neurocognitive phenotyping. We will assess 3,072 circulating plasma proteins (including >700 inflammation
related proteins) for associations with risk factors for cognitive impairment, including age, social determinants
of health, and cardiometabolic risk factors, and with incident cognitive impairment and trajectories of cognitive
function over >17 years of follow-up. Differences in levels of identified proteomic biomarkers by race and sex
will be assessed. Finally, we will integrate available genome-wide genotyping data and the plasma protein data
newly generated in this study to determine if the protein data can elucidate mechanisms underlying
associations of previously identified genetic variants with dementia-related phenotypes. We hypothesize this
work will identify non-invasive protein biomarkers of cognitive impairment and ADRD, including risk biomarkers
which may have adverse levels in Black compared with White adults. This study is responsive to PAR-22-093
(NOT-AG-21-033: Health Disparities and Alzheimer’s Disease), assessing biological pathways that may
contribute to racial disparities in ADRD risk and related to NIA AD+ADRD Research Implementation Milestone
1.I. The proteomic data generated in this study will be made widely available to the scientific community
through appropriate public repositories (such as dbGaP). Results from this study may improve ADRD risk
prediction, elucidate biological mechanisms of ADRD, and improve understanding of factors that contribute to
ADRD health disparities."

Epidemiological evidence indicates individuals with insulin resistance (IR), dyslipidemia characteristic of
metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are at heightened risk for developing
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (ADRD). To examine mechanisms
whereby MetS/IR/T2DM contribute to dementia risk and vice versa, we will employ a validated nonhuman
primate (NHP) model that employs a high sugar diet (HSD) that accelerates the progression MetS/IR/T2DM,
including rapid induction of IR, systemic inflammation and dyslipidemia. We propose a longitudinal investigation
of the relationships between metabolic dysfunction, diabetes, and dementia over the course of one year with
NHPs on HSD. A comprehensive, integrated analysis of central and peripheral endpoints is proposed,
specifically synaptic through biochemical, immunochemical, transcriptomic, and proteomic assessments of the
hippocampus, cortical regions comprising the default network mode (DMN), and mediobasal hypothalamus
(MBH) via advanced imaging (MRI and PET), and molecular/cellular studies linking neuropathology,
inflammation, mitochondrial and vascular dysfunction, and behavior in MetS/IR/T2DM with AD and ADRD. We
will employ this highly translatable NHP model to investigate the mechanisms underlying how MetS/IR/T2DM
drives AD/ADRD and vascular pathology, and why AD/ADRD/vascular dementia aggravate MetS/IR/T2DM in a
vicious cycle. We will assess vulnerable circuits and regions comprising memory (hippocampus), executive
function (DMN), MBH with parallel assessments of biobehavior, cerebrovascular function, blood-brain-barrier
(BBB), and peripheral pathways, especially targeting inflammation. Synaptic, and circuit level dysfunction will be
quantified in the context of biobehavioral and peripheral metabolic outcomes and advanced imaging, including
regional brain blood flow and glucose utilization. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis HSD in NHPs initiates AD/ADRD-
like pathology and vascular impairment within vulnerable regions underlying memory and executive function,
providing a mechanistic link between MetS/IR and pathological cascades in dementia. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis
that HSD produces functional deficits in the brain and periphery in macaques with MetS/IR/T2DM to increase
risk of AD, ADRD, and/or vascular pathology and behavioral deficits. Mechanistic investigation will be executed
by evaluating neuropathology, biobehavioral parameters, vascular/BBB perturbations, neuroinflammation,
impairments of insulin signaling and mitochondrial mass/function with changes in peripheral tissues (e.g., liver)
by coordinated immunochemical, proteomic, transcriptomic, and advanced imaging assessments in the same
animals. We propose rigorous assessments of the pathological effects of systemic MetS/IR/T2DM on the brain
and cerebrovasculature and molecular and cellular architecture in a validated NHP model to recapitulate these
prevalent, interrelated disorders. Results from NHPs are highly translational, and will contribute to innovative
approaches for managing and ameliorating deleterious effects of MetS/IR on AD/ADRD pathology and dementia."
10797537,"Multi-cancer detection assays offer new opportunities to screen for many different cancers that currently have
limited options for early detection. The Cancer Screening Research Network (CSRN) will conduct definitive
clinical trials and studies to evaluate these assays. Design and implementation of screening trials involve many
challenges. Cancer incidence and death are rare events in an average risk population.Trial designs must
balance screening frequency, trial duration, and sample size to achieve trial objectives in a cost-efficient
manner. Implementation must anticipate issues such as non-adherence, non-compliance, and contamination.
Analysis must accommodate the design while adapting to the circumstances of implementation. The Statistics
and Data Management Center (SDMC) of the CSRN will offer a rigorous system for CSRN trial design,
management and analysis so that the information generated by CSRN trials forms a sound basis for national
cancer screening policy.
Our team brings together statistical leaders and clinical trial management experts with experience in major
clinical trials networks, including the Women’s Health Initiative Clinical Coordinating Center, the SWOG
Statistics and Data Management Center and the Early Detection Research Network Data Management and
Coordinating Center. We have expertly designed, implemented, analyzed and reported cancer screening,
prevention, and treatment trials. This work has required developing procedures and processes for expert
execution of trials and production of reliable results. It has necessitated creating close collaborations with
clinicians, scientists, patient advocates, and subject matter experts. And, particularly in the case of screening
trials, it has inspired development of novel statistical methods that have become established in the field.
Our goal is to promote excellence in all aspects of statistical and data management for the CSRN. To address
the critical questions regarding potential benefits and risks of new cancer screening methodologies, the CSRN
clinical trials must be designed and implemented with great integrity and efficiency to produce the most
knowledge possible within realistic constraints of time and resources. To attain these goals, the SDMC for the
CSRN has four specific aims: (1) Integrate the SDMC with the other CSRN components. (2) Provide rigorous
and high-quality designs and analysis for CSRN studies. (3) Build a state-of-the-art data system to ensure data
quality and integrity for CSRN trials. (4) Develop statistical and data management approaches to a large CSRN
screening clinical trial that would build upon the Vanguard study.
MCD testing represents a potential paradigm shift for cancer early detection. Successful execution of these
aims will ensure that the CSRN produces valid and reliable quantitative results concerning the efficacy and
benefit-harm tradeoffs of candidate products to support evidence-based policies concerning their use."
10797656,"PROJECT SUMMARY
New cancer screening technologies with great promise for reducing cancer death are emerging. These
technologies require large-scale, controlled clinical trials to evaluate their effectiveness and assess the
feasibility of adopting and implementing them into routine practice if effective. Furthermore, the National
Academy of Medicine and US Preventive Services Task Force have identified dozens of evidence gaps in
current cancer screening approaches that will need similar large scale randomized controlled trials and
longitudinal studies.1-3 To address this, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is creating a Cancer Screening
Research Network (CSRN) with a network of Accrual, Enrollment, and Screening Site (ACCESS) Hubs
capable of conducting clinical trials and longitudinal studies, a central Statistics and Data Management Center,
and a central Coordinating and Communication Center. We propose to create the Virginia CSRN ACCESS
Hub from long-standing, inter-institutional partnerships to assist in this important national effort. These
partnerships include 1) three health systems – Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Health, Inova Health
System, and Sentara Healthcare; 2) two medical schools – VCU and the Eastern Virginia Medical School;
3) two cancer centers – the Massey Comprehensive Cancer Center at VCU, an NCI-designated
comprehensive cancer center, and the Inova Health’s Schar Cancer Institute which includes a recently
launched Saville Cancer Screening and Prevention Center; 4) the NIH-funded Wright Regional Center for
Clinical and Translational Science; and 5) a state-wide, primary care practice-based research network (Virginia
Ambulatory Care Outcomes Research Network – ACORN). These entities have an established track record of
working together for decades; collectively care for a sizable proportion of state residents including the largest
safety net health system providing both urban and rural services to a majority of Virginia’s communities;
demonstrated expertise in recruiting and retaining marginalized and underserved patients and communities in
trials; and national expertise in cancer prevention, informatics, community engagement, and dissemination and
implementation science. The Virginia CSRN ACCESS Hub will initially recruit and retain at least 1,600
participants in the NCI-coordinated, three-arm randomized controlled Vanguard study to test two novel multi-
cancer detection (MCD) tests compared to usual cancer screening care. We will measure success by equitable
and inclusive recruitment, timeliness and adherence to the diagnostic workup and treatment protocols, and
participation in all national CSRN efforts. Additionally, we will conduct a novel, mixed methods analysis of our
work using a consolidated framework for implementation research constructures to demonstrate our hub’s
feasibility and sustainability for future CSRN trials and to assess factors necessary for widespread adoption of
MCD tests, if proven effective. Our hub will meaningfully contribute to the Vanguard study and will bring unique
partnerships, an equity lens, and dissemination and implementation expertise to the broader CSRN effort."

Speech-language impairments have been clinically and genetically linked with risks for mental health disorders, poor physical health, and poor educational outcomes. However, large-scale studies of speech-language deficits primarily remain the purview of research on learning disabilities and developmental disorders (e.g., articulation and fluency disorders; developmental language disorder; autism), underestimating the health impact of speech and language traits for all individuals. This project aims to investigate the overall health impact of speech and language difficulties, disorders, and risk. Specifically, we use unbiased, data-driven, computational approaches to examine the medical ""phenome"", or entire collection of health and disease outcomes (phenotypes) found in the All of Us Electronic Health Records (EH Rs). These phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) have great potential to discover comorbidities, shared genetic risk for multiple health conditions, and identify targets for early intervention and therapies. In Aim 1 studies, we characterize associations between speech-language difficulties or disorders, and the entirety of the medical phenome. In Aim 2A and 28 studies, we investigate how genetic predispositions for speech-language abilities that have not been measured in All of Us participants (e.g., spelling; phonemic awareness), are associated with the entire medical phenome. In Aim 2A, we focus on genetic risk markers that are derived directly from common genetic variants associated with speech-language phenotypes; and in Aim 28 we build on this by additionally incorporating aspects of the transcriptome (e.g., gene expression), which improves portability of genetic risk predictions across multiple ancestry, and particularly in African Americans - a community who are highly underrepresented in biomedical research, and both historically and presently subject to systemic health inequity. Our approach, which is agnostic to specific clinical phenotypes, symptoms, diagnoses, or disorders, will reveal population-level health and disease outcomes associated with speech-language traits in populations that are usually underrepresented in biomedical research. This project directly responds to the call to make discoveries using high-quality All of Us data; advances the NIDCD mission to improve the lives of people with communication disorders; and enhances diversity in genomics research through the use of diverse data, and through opportunities for diversifying the workforce. By combining precision medicine techniques with a health equity and community-engaged focus, findings from this project will address critical health needs for subsets of individuals with certain clinical and/or genetic risk factors related to speech and language, as well as entire communities in whom communication traits/disorders have been understudied."

The goal of this proposal is to capture and then characterize engrams for ethanol tolerance in Drosophila.
Engrams are the neurons and their molecular changes that encode lasting behavioral change. Engrams
described for ethanol in mammals are limited to specific brain regions, encoding factors, and behavioral states,
and little is known about effectors in ethanol engrams. Drosophila offer significantly higher throughput, facilitating
whole brain capture of engrams, testing of multiple types of potential engrams, and molecular discovery of the
mechanisms of encoding. Further, we developed behavioral paradigms for rapid, chronic, and repeated exposure
tolerance, and we discovered that they are encoded by distinct immediate early gene transcription factors. We
will develop a new method to permanently tag engrams in the brain. Permanent tagging lets us define molecular
changes in engram neurons, explore their function as tolerance is acquired and then expressed, and to define
their function in brain circuits. Comparing the anatomy and effector molecules for different forms of tolerance will
unveil the complex actions of ethanol on the brain. Our focus on evolutionarily conserved factors provides a
means for future development of diagnostics and therapeutics for alcohol use disorders."
10810131,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 One of the pathological features of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the dysfunction of protein degradation
pathways including macro- and chaperone mediated autophagy. Interestingly, while tau is a substrate of these
pathways, it can also contribute to their impairment. Our data and that from other groups suggest that tau also
causes disruption of endosomal microautophagy (eMi) as well. Increased numbers of multivesicular bodies and
higher levels of Hsc70, a chaperone involved in eMi, are found in AD patients and tau models. Further evidence
of perturbation in the endosomal system can be seen in the association of tau and eMi pathway markers with
granulovacuolar degeneration. In AD, disruption of eMi is especially important as can result in further buildup of
tau aggregates, impaired neurotransmission, and spreading of pathology between cells.
 Tau potentially impacts eMi at multiple points in the pathway including: 1) decreased mitochondrial ATP
production, complex expression, ROS production, and depolarization; 2) altering Hsc70 activity or reducing
Hsc70 availability through aberrant binding or sequestration; 3) changes in the localization or levels of eMi
proteins, and; 4) disruption of endosomal membrane integrity. We hypothesize that tau plays a causal role in
destabilization of eMi through mitochondrial disruption as well as lowered availability of key pathway components
via aberrant binding, changes in activity, or sequestration. The proposed experiments will answer these
questions by elucidating the role of pathological tau in the disruption of eMi, clarifying which eMi components
are vulnerable to tau pathology, and whether eMi normalization is sufficient to correct tau-induced deficits.
 In Aim 1 we will manipulate components of the microautophagy (eMi) pathway to determine their
vulnerability to pathological tau. We will culture neurons from iPSCs derived from human patients, which express
wild-type or mutant tau. Cells will be exposed to pathological tau isolated from AD brain, allowing us to measure
the impact of wild-type, mutant, and aggregated tau on eMi. Further, we will determine the impact of tau on flux
and which autophagy pathways are active, using live cell imaging. We will also directly alter the activity and/or
expression of key eMi components, allowing us to discover which are most affected by tau pathology.
 In Aim 2 we will express mutant Hsc70, which is eMi competent but lacks ATPase function, in the brain
of tauopathy mice. Published work and our preliminary data indicate that Hsc70 activity is altered in the presence
of tau pathology. This approach will allow us to specifically target eMi, without interfering with the native Hsc70,
to test whether normalizing its activity will rescue tau-induced dysfunction in eMi and neuronal signaling.
 An understanding of how tau pathology leads to disruption of eMi is of great relevance to public health.
eMi is crucial for maintaining protein quality control and neuronal function, and impacts the spreading of tau
aggregates. At the conclusion of the proposed experiments, we will have identified which aspects of eMi are
most vulnerable to tau pathology and homed in on potential targets for future intervention."

Millions of individuals are infected with Taenia solium (the pork tapeworm) globally. T. solium causes two main
types of disease: (1) intestinal disease (“taeniasis”), which is acquired after ingestion of T. solium larvae
(“cysticerci”) via infected pork and is often undiagnosed as it is typically asymptomatic or only results in mild
gastrointestinal symptoms, and (2) tissue disease (“cysticercosis”), which occurs after inadvertent consumption
of T. solium eggs. Cysticercosis can develop once T. solium eggs hatch into embryonic larva in the human
intestine, migrate to various host organ systems, and develop into cystic larvae within the tissue.
Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is the most consequential form of cysticercosis, causing an estimated 2.8 million
disability-adjusted life years globally due to chronic neurologic sequela.
Most patients with NCC are asymptomatic or do not develop the classic clinical manifestations of NCC
(headaches, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits) until years after initial exposure; thus, detection of disease
prior to the onset of symptoms via screening protocols could prevent significant morbidity. However, there is
currently no consensus or guideline for screening for taeniasis or NCC. An inexpensive protocol for taeniasis
and NCC screening would facilitate identification of index cases and early diagnosis of NCC cases.
The possibility of widespread exposure to T. solium among people from endemic countries now living in the US
has clinical and public health implications because these populations have resettled in a country where the
infection is not endemic and where many clinical providers are not familiar with the disease manifestations,
diagnosis, or treatment. This research proposal describes a cross-sectional pilot study of people at risk for T.
solium exposure, with the overall objective of developing a NCC screening approach that will improve NCC
screening practices. The proposal’s specific aims are (1) to evaluate NCC prevalence in the household
contacts of NCC patients and (2) to compare a panel of T. solium biologic tests as NCC screening tools. These
aims will be achieved by recruiting the household contacts of NCC patients and evaluating them via a variety of
stool, blood, and urine T. solium-specific tests paired with gold-standard neuroimaging. High-performing
screening approaches will be compared to determine which are accurate and cost-effective.
This study will generate important preliminary data essential to development of an effective NCC screening
protocol. It will be the first to evaluate NCC screening in a non-endemic setting and the first to evaluate the
head-to-head performance of laboratory-developed cysticercosis blood and urine biomarker tests paired with
neuroimaging as NCC screening tools."

Recently, my laboratory has found that the NEP-like endopeptidases, neprilysin (NEP) and NEP2, have a role
in acute recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This has interesting and exciting implications for the TBI
field as well as for understanding risk factors for developing dementia. The causal links between TBI and
dementia are becoming better understood. Many of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are
shared with early changes in TBI. Of note are the rapid elevations of the amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide after TBI.
Natural mechanisms of clearance of Aβ are important in slowing the progression of AD and so these clearance
mechanisms may also be important in TBI. Both NEP and its homolog NEP2 degrade Aβ and are important for
controlling cerebral levels of the peptide. We propose a role for these enzymes in the processes following TBI.
To further investigate the role(s) of NEP/NEP2 in TBI we will use our APP humanized transgenic mice and
alter the activity of these enzymes in a TBI context in both short (aim 1) and long-term (aim 2) assessments.
This project will determine the importance of NEP-like enzymes in the acute pathology post TBI as well as in
the development dementia."

Peripheral T-cell lymphomas including cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are poorly understood and many
subtypes exhibit aggressive clinical course and high mortality with short (2-year) life expectancy after
diagnosis. Poor understanding of mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CTCLs contributes to
suboptimal diagnostic subcategorization and lack of targeted therapies. Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sezary
syndrome (SS) are two major forms of CTCL. Clinical staging and outcome of MF and SS is dependent on
the quantity of neoplastic cells in the blood. While SS is an aggressive disease with poor overall survival
(42.3% at 5 years and is by definition diagnosed at late stage disease, there are many patients with low
tumor burden (Early-stage CTCL) who suffer from delay in diagnosis due to the subjective nature of the
diagnostic criteria. The mean diagnostic delay (measured as the time from emergence of skin lesions to the
diagnosis of SS) is long (4.2 year; median 2.8 years) with a significant variation (1 month to 32 years).
Thus, there is a critical need for improved methods for early disease detection. Furthermore, the
identification of genomic disease biomarkers that would establish early diagnosis and provide prognostic
information would clearly have benefit for patients with this form of aggressive CTCL. Until recently,
recurrent genetic alterations that can be exploited as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers have not been
described in these tumors. Our laboratory and other investigators recently described the genomic
landscape of CTCL utilizing a comprehensive integrated strategy including whole genome sequencing,
whole exome sequencing and array comparative gnomic hybridization. Highly recurrent gene mutations
targeting epigenetic and chromatin remodeling and JAK-STAT and other pathways were identified in pre-
treatment samples of CTCL. Based on these results, it is our central hypothesis that somatic alterations
involved in the pathogenesis of CTCL in conjunction with high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of the T-cell
receptor (TCR) can be utilized for early diagnosis and that genetic profiles and sensitive and
quantitative detection of clonal T-cell populations can serve as prognostically-relevant biomarkers of
CTCL. Accordingly, in Specific Aim 1, we propose to investigate the utility of a multivariate model based on
targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) and HTS-TCR assays for the diagnosis of ES-CTCL and Late-
stage CTCL (SS). In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate the impact of the genetic mutations and HTS-TCR
on the prognosis of ES-CTCL and SS using a retrospective cohort. In Specific Aim 3, we will assess
the performance of the multivariate model for assessing the prognosis of ES-CTCL and SS using a
prospective cohort. The overall impact of this proposal is the development of targeted genomic assays that
will lead to early and accurate diagnosis of CTCL and improve methods to assess early disease detection
and prognosis."

More than 30 years have passed since the discovery of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, yet
we still lack comprehensive insights into its regulatory mechanisms. This limitation arises
because most of the approximately 600 ubiquitin ligase enzymes in mammals remain largely
uncharacterized. Our laboratory has focused on how Cullin-RING Ubiquitin Ligase (CRL)
complexes control the three essential dimensions of cellular life: proliferation, survival, and
differentiation. We have played a central role in elucidating how, when, where and, most
importantly, why CRLs mediate the degradation of key cellular regulators. The research in my
laboratory initially focused on the paradigm of the timed regulation of the mammalian cell cycle
by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which we established a number of years ago. We have
since expanded our research into five fields of study: (i) cell signaling, (ii) cell cycle control, (iii)
the DNA damage response, (iv) oncology, and (v) the circadian clock. This expansion of our
interests has been possible thanks to our discovery-driven approach that, in contrast to the
more common hypothesis-driven approach, is unbiased. Yet, the results of genetics and
proteomics screens are not our end goal, but they guide us to explain the underlying biological
concepts and mechanisms. Importantly, they often lead us to unexpected and unexplored new
territories, opening our horizons. In summary, we use a comprehensive and interdisciplinary
approach to break new grounds and make transformative discoveries that will provide new
mechanistic insights into fundamental biological processes, particularly those processes that are
regulated by CRLs. The current proposed research will cover all the mechanistic studies
performed in our laboratory concerning areas i-iii listed above. In particular, we will leverage our
recognized expertise in the ubiquitin field to discover molecular mechanisms by which CRLs
control signal transduction pathways, autophagy, cell cycle progression, and DNA repair.
Moreover, we will perform biochemical, cellular and in vivo analyses to illuminate how CRLs are
regulated to function as switches between diverse cell fates. These findings will substantially
advance our understanding of the proper execution of crucial cellular processes, potentially
shedding light on the etiologies and treatments of human diseases."

Dengue virus (DENV) vaccine development has been challenging because of the presence of 4 serotypes
(DENV1-4) and the potential for vaccine enhanced severe disease. The leading live attenuated tetravalent DENV
vaccines have been plagued by poorly balanced replication of vaccine components leading to variable efficacy
and vaccine primed severe dengue disease in some children. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel
recombinant DENV envelope (E) protein and virus like particle (VLP) vaccines that overcome barriers faced by
live attenuated tetravalent vaccines. We have discovered that the DENV E protein produced as a secreted
protein is a poor vaccine because it is a monomer that does not display major quaternary epitopes targeted by
human neutralizing and protective antibodies (Abs). This proposal is based on new discoveries from our group
about how structure based, computational approaches can be used to produce highly stable and properly folded
DENV E dimers that are efficiently secreted from mammalian cells. We will use mouse models of DENV
vaccination and infection to test if artificially stabilized DENV E dimers stimulate Ab responses that are similar to
serotype-specific and serotype-cross-protective Ab responses in people exposed to primary and secondary wild
type DENV infections. The stabilized E dimers will be further modified to test if large-scale resurfacing of the E
dimer can be used to focus the immune response on epitopes recognized by potent neutralizing Abs, while
eliminating responses to off target, disease enhancing epitopes. Finally, we will design membrane anchored
variants of stabilized E dimers to promote the formation of dengue virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine candidates
that better resemble mature infectious virions than VLPs made with current techniques. Our studies, which
explore how to design and deliver recombinant E antigens to focus the host antibody response on important
quaternary structure neutralizing epitopes, will stimulate new research directions in the field of flavivirus subunit
vaccines."
10813071,"The lysosome, the main hub for cellular degradation and recycling processes, is emerging as
a crucial signaling platform that controls cell metabolism. It is now clear that lysosomal
signaling plays an important role in a variety of cancers. The Transcription Factor EB (TFEB),
a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, is both a substrate and a regulator
of the mTORC1 lysosomal kinase complex, which drives growth and whose hyperactivation is
broadly associated with cancer. Overexpression or constitutive activation of TFEB results in
kidney cancer in two distinct disease entities: MiT-TFE Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) and Birt-
Hogg-Dube' (BHD) syndrome, an inherited disease caused by mutations of folliculin (FLCN),
a crucial regulator of TFEB activity. The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms
underlying TFEB-mediated kidney tumorigenesis. Emerging evidence suggest that such
mechanisms may be involved in other disorders associated to kidney cancer, such Tuberous
Sclerosis. Using sophisticated kidney-specific mouse transgenic models and CRE-fluorescent
reporters, we will perform metabolic, biochemical, cell biology, omic and tumorigenesis assays
both in vivo and in renal cultured cells with the aim of identifying the metabolic and signaling
programs that underlie BHD and MiT-RCC tumorigenesis. In particular, these studies will allow
us to dissect TFEB-regulated pathways that drive kidney tumorigenesis in both an mTOR-
dependent and independent manner. To dissect these oncogenic programs in mechanistic
depth, we will perform a detailed molecular characterization of FLCN- and mTORC1-
dependent TFEB phosphorylation, coupled with candidate-based and high throughput genetic
screens for novel TFEB regulators. Together, these studies will shed light on the pathogenesis
of kidney tumors, and point the way toward new targets and therapeutic strategies."
10811958,"Abstract
The overarching goal of this proposal is to obtain general principles of dendritic computation. The starburst
amacrine cell (SAC) of the mammalian retina is an excellent model to study dendritic function because it has a
rich set of generic dendritic processing machineries and a well-defined computation – direction selectivity. Its
radially oriented dendritic sectors are tuned to different directions of visual motion stimuli, and thereby confer
direction selectivity to the output neurons of the retina. Previous studies have generated substantial knowledge
on the spatiotemporal patterns of synaptic inputs onto the SAC dendritic arbor. However, how motion-evoked
inputs are transformed by SAC dendrites to generate robust outward direction selectivity is not well understood.
This application therefore focuses on the dendritic mechanism and how it is influenced by the synaptic input. We
will obtain the objective of the proposed research using a combination of patch clamp recording, two-photon
calcium, glutamate and voltage imaging during visual stimulation, and behavioral assay. Insights from this
proposal will challenge the conventional view that synaptic inputs are processed by dendrites equipped with a
stable set of intrinsic biophysical properties. Our study will advance the field of dendritic computation by
establishing a more dynamic relationship between synaptic activity and the algorithm of dendritic integration."
10811961,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The precision and accuracy of vertebrate movement is mediated, in part, by the cerebellum. Two primary
divisions of the cerebellum – the cortex and nuclei – are clearly delineated modules that contribute to
behaviorally-relevant computations. Sensorimotor information is first processed by the cortex and is then relayed
to the nuclei by Purkinje cells (PCs). The resultant output of the cerebellar nuclei has profound influence on
downstream motor control, motivating questions of how nuclear activity is controlled by PCs. In a model behavior,
mouse reaching, reach endpoint dysmetria, a hallmark of cerebellar damage, is attributed to the dysfunction of
anticipatory braking signals from the cerebellar interposed nucleus that slow the limb near the intended target
location. This proposal builds on observations in the previous cycle that the firing rates between Purkinje neurons
and their targets in the interposed nucleus are inverse of one another, consistent with a population rate code
mediating information transfer. However, in addition to inverse rate coding, we find, as in other species and
behaviors, that Purkinje neurons synchronize simple spike firing selectively during behavior. Our proposed
studies investigate the sufficiency of PC rate and temporal coding to generate behaviorally relevant adjustments
to reach kinematics in mice.The objective of this proposal is to testthe central hypothesis that cerebellar cortical
circuits selectively transmit population activity through a synergistic rate and temporal code, imparted by local
cortical inhibition, and that this code is refined by learning. We propose to delineate the behavioral significance
of PC population coding, how it is generated by cerebellar circuitry, and how motor learning engages the dual
nature of this synergistic rate and temporal code. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Future therapies targeted
at ameliorating cerebellar disease will increasingly leverage understanding of computational mechanisms of the
structure, thus identifying those principles, the goal of this proposal, is of central importance."

 Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus accelerate aging shortening the duration of healthspan. Conversely,
chronic calorie restriction extends healthspan. Most research aimed at understanding the mechanism by which
calorie restriction slows aging has focused on insulin and downstream signaling cascades. Similarly, the
accelerated aging in type 2 diabetes is largely attributed to dysfunctional insulin signaling. Glucagon, a hormone
that counter-regulates insulin, is commonly affected by these same interventions.
 We have shown that glucagon receptor deletion decreases median lifespan by 35% in normal weight mice.
Glucagon receptor deletion shortens lifespan to a greater degree in diet induced obese mice and prevents the
extension in lifespan resulting from calorie restriction. This proposes that the hyperglucagonemia in obesity may
be protective against obesity accelerated aging and that glucagon is essential for calorie restriction to extend
lifespan.
 Although the role of glucagon receptor signaling in aging has not been heavily investigated, the rigor of this
work is supported by known effects of glucagon on downstream messengers that extend healthspan. Both
AMPK activity and cyclic AMP are established mediators that extend healthspan. Glucagon activates AMPK
and increases cAMP.
 Highlighting the significance of this proposal, Glucagon receptor agonists are entering the market for the
treatment of diabetes and obesity. To understand the potential impact of these agonists, we propose to study
the role of glucagon receptor signaling in normal aging, the accelerated aging in obesity, and the slowed aging
resulting from calorie restriction.
 We propose 2 aims that focus on genetic (Aim 1) and pharmacological (Aim 2) manipulation to increase
glucagon receptor signaling. We will combine these models with dietary models of obesity and calorie restriction
and with genetic models of normal glucagon receptor signaling and glucagon receptor knockout to better
understand the role of glucagon receptor signaling in normal aging, obesity accelerated aging, and the slowed
aging resulting from calorie restriction.
 We have established that glucagon is integral in extending lifespan in calorie restriction and maintaining
lifespan in obesity. We appreciate that insulin plays a key role in aging, but also recognize that pharmacologically
targeting insulin signaling is limited because of the key role of insulin in glucose homeostasis. Conversely,
glucagon receptor agonists are safe. In turn, this research provides a unique opportunity to identify a new,
therapeutically viable target to extend healthspan and lifespan."
10814133,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Diabetes Mellitus (DM), a metabolic disorder characterized by defective insulin signaling and elevated blood
glucose, has become a public health epidemic with half of the US population diagnosed with either DM or pre-
diabetes. One of the most common and devastating sequelae of uncontrolled DM is the development of chronic
non-healing wounds. An estimated 25% of diabetic patients develop chronic non-healing ulcers in their lifetime
that, given the poor vascularity and immunodeficiency associated with diabetes, are highly susceptible to
infection and frequently result in limb amputation. DM is currently the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S.
Current management primarily focuses on controlling wound bioburden to promote wound healing, which
includes pressure off-loading, antimicrobial medications and dressings, judicious wound care, and optimization
of lifestyle factors. However, complete wound closure is complicated by impairment of cellular migration and
function in DM wounds. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop novel therapeutic methods for diabetic
wounds that directly restore the molecular and cellular processes required to promote proper cutaneous repair.
 Injuries in diabetic patients often persist and progress. Chronic DM causes significant alterations to several
physiologic wound healing mechanisms that impair timely cell infiltration/migration, granulation tissue formation,
and wound contraction. Based on more than 20 years of research on wound healing management, we have
developed a technologically innovative fibromodulin (FMOD)-based amino acid peptide sequence, SLI-F06, that
markedly stimulates fibroblast and endothelial cell migration and myofibroblast differentiation/contraction to
promote timely wound closure. Previously, we demonstrated that SLI-F06 significantly promotes acute wound
healing without eliciting any adverse effects in preclinical animal studies at maximal feasible dosing as well as
in ongoing Phase 1/2a clinical trial targeting acute wound healing. Excitingly, we have shown that repeated SLI-
F06 administration significantly accelerates diabetic wound closure in a mouse model (NONcNZO10/LtJ) that
closely simulates human type 2 DM. The goal of the current Fast-track SBIR application is to obtain the key
preclinical efficacy and mechanism of action data for SLI-F06 as a repeatedly administered, locally
applied therapeutic for diabetic wounds for expanding the clinical indication of SLI-F06. Overall, this
proposal will accomplish key efficacy and mechanism of action (MOA) objectives to expedite commercialization
of SLI-F06-based therapy for diabetic wounds. This product can significantly improve the quality of life of diabetic
patients suffering from chronic wounds that can lead to amputations and death."
10814234,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
This is a K23 award application for Dr. Melissa Cortez, a neurologist and young investigator pursuing patient-
oriented clinical research on sensory and autonomic dysfunction in post-traumatic headache (PTH). A K23 award
will provide her with the means to acquire critical skills in three key career development areas: biostatistics,
signal processing, and visual function testing (visual psychophysics). By acquiring these skills, Dr. Cortez will
fulfill her career goal of becoming an independent investigator in the field of autonomic neurology. To pursue this
goal, Dr. Cortez has assembled the mentoring team of Drs. KC Brennan (primary mentor), a systems neurosci-
entist with expertise in circuit dysfunction of headache and traumatic brain injury (TBI), and Kathleen Digre (co-
mentor), a neuro-ophthalmologist with expertise in photophobia and pupillary function. Complementing them is
a three-person Advisory Committee with authorities in biostatistics, autonomic neurophysiology, and visual psy-
chophysics.
PTH is a notoriously disabling and treatment refractory chronic pain condition, and is the most common conse-
quence of TBI. With the rising incidence of TBI, PTH represents a critically important, actionable public health
issue, in which objective diagnostic and disease progression measures are needed. Based on recent evidence
and her own preliminary data, Dr. Cortez's central hypothesis is that photophobia in PTH corresponds to objec-
tive changes in pupillary autonomic function that are associated with an increased risk of persistent symptoms.
She will test this hypothesis by evaluating pupillary function in PTH subjects with photophobia (Aim 1) and de-
termining whether these changes predict poor recovery (Aim 2). She will also evaluate whether PTH-related
photophobia is worse when exposed to specific colors of light (Aim 3). If successful, this work will lead to much
needed objective measures of PTH disease burden, enabling early identification and individually targeted inter-
ventions for PTH patients most at risk of prolonged symptoms.
The proposed research is significant because PTH remains poorly understood and is a disorder where disease
specific treatments are lacking. The proposed research is innovative because it combines sensory and auto-
nomic testing to better understand and conceptualize the underlying disease mechanisms, as well as provide
objectively measurable markers of disease with clinical utility for identifying patients at risk for disease progres-
sion. Additionally, this work will lead to individually targeted, non-addictive therapies targeting sympathetic mod-
ulation (vagal nerve stimulation, alpha and/or beta-blockade) and/or light-mitigation therapies for chronic PTH-
related pain."
10814134,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The broad objective of the current application is to advance our understanding of 2 major clinical phenotypes
of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF): 1) HFpEF with volume overload in the presence of
chronic kidney diseases (HFpEF-CKD) and 2) HFpEF with exercise induced (HFpEF-EI) dyspnea, to elucidate
the differences in the pathophysiological mechanisms, to identify biomarkers to differentiate the two clinical
phenotypes and to develop novel therapies for individualization of treatment. 50% of patients with heart failure
(HF) have preserved EF. Pathophysiological heterogeneity in HFpEF is substantial, ranging from chronic kidney
diseases, diabetes, obesity, hypertension, etc. There is no FDA approved therapy for HFpEF (LVEF>55%) which
may be due to the heterogeneous underlying pathophysiological causes. Recently, the NHLBI Research
Priorities for HFpEF Working Group emphasized the need for phenotyping of patients with HFpEF so as to
classify patients into phenotypically homogeneous subpopulations, to understand pathophysiological
mechanisms and to facilitate individualization of treatment. Sacubatril/valsartan is a dual angiotensin receptor
(AT1) blocker and neprilysin (NEP) inhibitor which is approved for management of HFrEF. However, the
PARAGON Study failed to demonstrate significant clinical benefit in HFpEF patients. This may be because NP
are very low in some subgroups of HFpEF, thus negating the actions of NEP inhibition and therefore,
Sacubatril/valsartan effectively functions as an AT1blocker, which has previously been shown to be not beneficial
in HFpEF. Therefore, we hypothesized that the endogenous NP levels (specifically ANP) are low in those with
exercise induced dyspnea as compared to those with CKD and extravascular fluid overload. Hence, those with
HFpEF-EI may not respond to Sacubatril/valsartan but will respond to exogenous NPs administration, while
those with HFpEF-CKD will respond to Sacubatril/valsartan due to increased endogenous NPs. MANP is a novel
particulate-guanylyl-cyclase A (pGC-A) receptor activator designed at the Mayo Clinic which is more potent than
ANP in promoting natriuresis, inhibiting aldosterone with greater activation of cGMP and longer half-life. Our
Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To perform high definition phenotyping of HFpEF-CKD and HFpEF-EI, defining
the differential cardiorenal and humoral response to acute saline volume expansion (VE) Specific Aim 2: To
determine the effects of neprilysin and angiotensin receptor inhibition with Sacubatril/valsartan on the cardiorenal
and humoral response to acute VE in HFpEF-CKD and HFpEF-EI. Specific Aim 3: To determine the effects of
MANP on the cardiorenal and humoral response to acute VE in HFpEF-CKD and HFpEF-EI.
The impact of our proposed studies is high as it will advance our knowledge of the integrated cardiorenal and
humoral physiology in patients with HFpEF-CKD and HFpEF-EI, and to test novel diagnostic and therapeutic
strategies specific for HFpEF-CKD and HFpEF-EI, thus advancing a precision medicine approach in HFpEF."
10814237,"Progress in the early detection and treatment of cancer requires accurate model systems to further evaluate
new, promising discoveries. Small animal, and in particular mouse, model systems are attractive to researchers
for numerous reasons, including their ease of use and well-described platforms. Immunotherapy has
revolutionized clinical oncology, but lacks pre-clinical models of the human immune system and human cancer
to investigate new modalities and limitations/toxicities of treatment regimens. The ability to grow human tumors
in immune-deficient mice (so-called patient-derived xenografts, or PDXs) allows researchers to work directly with
human cancer tissue in a controlled setting. However, PDX models are limited by their lack of an intact immune
system. The broad objective of this proposal is to validate an in vivo model to evaluate human tumors in the
context of a complete and intact human immune system in a completely personalized and autologous
fashion to study cancer immunotherapy. Herein, we propose to: (1) validate the ability of our humanized
system to serve as a model for cancer immunotherapy treatment response and toxicity in patients with
melanoma, including immunotherapy checkpoint blockade and vaccine strategies, and to (2) extend our current
work in melanoma by validating the ability to establish humanized mice and evaluate tumor growth and leukocyte
development in autologous human pancreatic and colorectal tumors established in humanized mice.
In each of these areas, we will leverage our multi-institutional team's individual expertise along with our
institutional infrastructure to maximize the success of the experimental aims. The results from this project will
made widely available to the general research community for future, hypothesis-driven research. Taken together,
the studies described in this research proposal will meet multiple goals and address several unmet needs
identified in this grant opportunity, thus significantly enhancing the applicability of a fully autologous and
immunocompetent precision model system for use in translational oncology research."

Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child
health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the country,
a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years, under
RFA-DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the consortium, and
will track their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health,
and culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual
interviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of
developmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and
parents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through
adolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our
understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping)
interact with each other and with a child's changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral,
academic, health, and other outcomes.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen
time, sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences influence brain development; (5)
determine and replicate factors that influence mental health from childhood to young adulthood; (6)
characterize relationships between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of substances
such as cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine affects developmental outcomes, and how neural, cognitive,
emotional, and environmental factors influence the risk for adolescent substance use."
10784996,"ABSTRACT
Tumor-associated macrophages are critical regulators of tumor development, progression, and metastasis.
Factors in the tumor microenvironment induce tumor-associated macrophages to adopt a tumor-supportive
phenotype that suppresses immune responses. The accumulation of tumor-supportive macrophages in tumors
is associated with accelerated tumor progression and a poor patient prognosis. Macrophages sense and respond
to their environment by expressing pattern-recognition receptors such as Class-A Scavenger Receptors (SR-A).
In preliminary data, we show that SR-A binds to glycans expressed on breast cancer cells but not on non-cancer
cells. Furthermore, we show that SR-A expression promotes the development of palpable tumors and lung
metastases in mouse models that spontaneously develop breast cancer. Importantly, results from gene
expression profiling indicate that tumor-associated macrophages adopt an immune-suppressive phenotype in
SR-A-expressing mice but not in SR-A knock-out mice. These findings support the novel conclusion that SR-A
binding to tumor-specific ligands induces the polarization of tumor-infiltrating macrophages toward an immune-
suppressive phenotype that enhances breast cancer growth and metastases. It logically follows that inhibiting
SR-A interactions in tumors may provide an innovative approach that repolarizes TAMs to an antitumor
phenotype, improves the effectiveness of anti-tumor immune response, and inhibits breast cancer progression.
Thus, the goals of the proposed experiments are to i) identify the ligands on breast cancer cells that bind SR-A
and induce macrophage polarization toward a protumor phenotype, and ii) demonstrate that antagonizing SR-A
repolarizes macrophages toward a tumor-inhibitory phenotype, enhances the immune response, and prolongs
survival in preclinical models of breast cancer. Showing that antagonizing SR-A interactions increases anti-tumor
immune activity and prolongs survival in animal models will confirm the therapeutic potential of this approach to
treat breast cancer. In addition, identifying tumor-associated ligands that interact with SR-A may suggest
additional tumor-specific strategies for inhibiting these interactions."
10785044,"Human papillomaviruses (HPV) infect stratified squamous epithelia and link their productive life cycles to the
differentiation of the host cell. HPVs infect cells in the basal layer of stratified epithelia and establish genomes
as low copy nuclear episomes. When HPV infected cells migrate from the basal layer, they undergo
differentiation and in suprabasal layers re-enter S/G2 phases to allow for vegetative viral DNA replication in a
process referred to as amplification. HPV replication is regulated by viral and cellular factors that control cell
cycle progression, differentiation, and DNA damage repair pathways. Our studies have shown that activation of
two homologous recombination repair (HR) pathways, the ataxia telangiectasia (ATM) pathway as well as the
ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) pathway, is required for differentiation-dependent amplification of
viral genomes. Two additional pathways that repair DNA breaks are referred to as non-homologous end joining
and include the classical non-homologous end-joining pathway (c-NHEJ) and the alternate end joining pathway
(alt-EJ). These pathways have been characterized as error-prone but recent work indicates c-NHEJ can be
substantially error free. Importantly, we determined that levels of the activated c-NHEJ factors, such as pDNA-
PK, are significantly increased in HPV positive cells relative to HFKs. Importantly, treatment of HPV positive cells
with either of two drugs that inhibit pDNA-pK activation block viral replication with no effect on cell growth.
Additional studies have shown that members of the alt-EJ pathway are also elevated in HPV positive cells but
how they affect HPV replication is still unclear. In this application, we will investigate how c-NHEJ and alt-EJ
function in HPV replication. We will determine if c-NHEJ factors associate with viral genomes and if knockdown
of individual c-NHEJ factors affects replication. Additional studies will use reporters to measure total c-NHEJ
activity and investigate if it is altered in comparison to normal keratinocytes. The viral factors responsible for
increases will be determined along with the mechanisms mediating the choice between HR and c-NHEJ repair.
These studies will provide insights into how activation of c-NHEJ affects HPV replication. A second set of studies
will investigate how increases in the levels of alt-EJ factors contribute to regulation of HPV replication. Alt-EJ is
an error prone activity that generates small deletions upon repair. Since HPV genomes are largely error free,
how this pathway affects HPV replication is unclear. We will determine the factors involved and how they affect
HPV replication. One member of this pathway is PARP1 which is regulated by cleavage by Caspase 3 proteases.
PARP1 activates alt-EJ while the cleaved products inhibit. High levels of both are detected in HPV positive cells
and how this regulates alt-EJ activity along with replication will be examined. Overall, this proposal describes
studies aimed at understanding how HPV replication is controlled by non-homologous end joining repair
pathways."
10785028,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Aedes albopictus (Ae. albopictus), also known as the Asian tiger mosquito, is a highly
invasive and aggressive disease vector that has rapidly invaded every continent on earth except
Antarctica. Ae. albopictus spreads diseases including Zika, Chikungunya, yellow fever, and
dengue. Despite its immediate threat to human health, Ae. albopictus is highly understudied.
Studies of other mosquitoes have focused on investigating how they integrate olfactory, visual,
and thermal cues to guide their attraction to a blood-meal host. By contrast, there has been
remarkably little study of mosquito taste systems, even though they may play a role in gating the
final behavioral decision to bite a host. In particular, virtually nothing is known about taste in Ae.
albopictus, a disease vector now in the US whose range is expanding rapidly because it
outcompetes other species and because of climate change.
 Here we propose to use a systematic and multidisciplinary approach to test the
hypothesis that Ae. albopictus uses its taste system to detect taste cues and guide biting
behaviors. Because one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of vector-borne
pathogens is through prevention of biting, more in-depth investigation of taste cues influencing
biting behaviors may aid in development of improved vector control methods.
 Using novel tools, we will examine new aspects of chemical cues, neuronal taste coding,
and receptors that affect biting behaviors. To investigate the cellular basis of taste detection, we
will systematically test the physiological responses of taste neurons to a panel of taste compounds,
including blends of host cues with varying compositions. We will examine the effect of host cues
on biting behaviors. This may shed light on the age-old question of why some people get bitten
more than others by mosquitoes. We will functionally test the genetic basis of host detection by
generating transgenic CRISPR-Cas9 mutant mosquitoes. In summary, we aim to elucidate the
mechanism of an understudied mosquito sensory system in a species that is highly invasive and
dangerous yet has received relatively little attention.
 The mentoring team and Yale University provide ideal support for Dr. Baik’s path to
independence. The research and career development objectives outlined in this proposal will
provide the training needed for Dr. Baik to secure an Assistant Professor position by the end of
the K99 phase, and to apply for R01 funding as an independent investigator."

 Dr. Michael Hughes, an instructor in Stanford University's Division of Endocrinology, Gerontology, and
Metabolism, is motivated by his personal experience living with type 1 diabetes to improve care and outcomes
for individuals with the condition. He has recognized the potential of automated insulin delivery (AID) systems
to enhance care for hospitalized patients with diabetes, based on both individual experience in caring for these
patients and the encouraging results from collaboration in a recent pilot study. This K23 grant will support Dr.
Hughes in developing expertise as an independent clinical researcher to use AID to improve patient care in the
hospital by providing a structured research program, targeted training, and personalized mentorship.
 Hospitalized patients with diabetes are at higher risk of complications and death due to unstable blood
sugar levels. Traditional insulin therapy using multiple daily injections often fails to control blood sugar in the
hospital and results in high rates of both high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and low blood sugar
(hypoglycemia). Despite 20 years of limited advancements in hospital diabetes care, advancements in
diabetes technology have been remarkably successful in outpatient settings. Recent trials testing the use of
continuous glucose monitors in the hospital have marginally reduced hypoglycemia without reducing
hyperglycemia. AID systems, however, offer a promising solution. They use real-time glucose data to adjust
insulin delivery up to 288 times a day, providing a level of control and adaptation not possible with traditional
insulin therapy methods. While some patients already use their personal AID systems in the hospital, there are
limited data from these experiences and no systematically established guidance to support this use.
 The objective of the research in this proposal is to examine and optimize inpatient AID use. The research
aims to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of continuing home AID systems in the hospital among people with T1D,
(2) qualitatively identify and classify the barriers and facilitators associated with its use, and (3) develop
implementation strategies to advance and de-risk the use of AID systems in the hospital. This will provide
foundational data on the potential and limitations of current AID systems and advance their use in the hospital.
 Dr. Hughes has assembled a highly qualified team of mentors and advisors who are experts in diabetes,
diabetes technology, inpatient diabetes management, qualitative and implementation science research, clinical
informatics, hospital technology integration, and hospital medicine. The strategic combination of coursework in
research methods and qualitative techniques, along with the Master of Science in Clinical Informatics
Management, will equip Dr. Hughes with the necessary skills to effectively integrate technology into the
hospital setting. Through the mentorship, training, and research proposed, Dr. Hughes will position himself as
a leading expert and use this opportunity to establish himself as an independent physician-scientist."

My immediate career goals are 1) to obtain a tenure track position as a principal investigator and 2) to improve
our understanding of the structure and function of β-hairpin antimicrobial peptides to help combat antibiotic
resistant pathogens. My previous expertise, along with the career development laid out in this proposal, will
allow me to complete the proposed research strategy and achieve these two immediate goals.
 New strategies and methods for antibiotic discovery are critically needed. Macrocyclic peptides are a
promising class of antibiotic because they can target sites refractory to small molecule inhibition; however, their
large size limits their ability to bypass membranes and access intracellular targets. Macrocyclic cationic
antimicrobial peptides (CAMPs) are capable of penetrating bacterial membranes, but often have associated
toxicity, making them more difficult to use clinically. A small class of CAMPs with cyclic β-hairpin structure (β-
AMPs) access intracellular targets through bacterial membrane disruption and have a wide range of associated
toxicity. Unfortunately, the rarity of this class prevents our understanding of how their amino acid sequence
dictates their antibacterial potency and mammalian cell toxicity. I have helped developed a new synthetic
macrocyclic peptide screening technique which has identified thousands of synthetic β-AMPs, expanding
sequence information and allowing us to begin analyzing how their amino acid sequence impacts their
antibacterial potency, cell membrane specificity, and ultimately their therapeutic potential.
 During Phase I of this proposal, I plan to biochemically analyze a newly acquired dataset of putative β-
AMPs with diverse antibacterial potency and mammalian cell toxicity and use this data to train a machine
learning algorithm to identify sequence features promoting antibacterial specificity. The in vivo activity of lead
peptides will then be examined using the Galleria mellonella infection model. During Phase II, I will examine
how β-AMPs interact with and permeate cell membranes composed of different lipids using strains with
genetically modified lipopolysaccharide, in vitro liposome disruption assays, and ultraviolet photodissociation
mass spectrometry. This will help us understand how β-AMPs overcome traditional methods of CAMP
resistance and have an ability to selectively target bacterial cell membranes. Lastly, through modification of our
screening technique, I have generated predictive data for how over 7,000 mutational variants of one promising
natural β-AMP's amino acid sequence impacts its antimicrobial activity. I plan to evaluate the accuracy of these
predictions through biochemical evaluation of 48 of the 7,000 variants. Differences in the toxicity and
membrane specificity of this group will also be evaluated and compared to the native sequence to better
understand how certain residues impact therapeutic potential."

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis with a predilection for the spine and sacroiliac
joints, affecting 0.5-0.6% of the US population, that causes substantial morbidity and work-disability. AS spinal
damage is strongly related to poor physical function independent of disease activity - severe spinal disease
causing significant physical limitations. However, the course of AS spinal disease is highly heterogeneous,
ranging from damage limited to sacroiliac joints to complete spinal fusion. We characterized AS patients'
longitudinal spinal progression over a 15-year interval, revealing 4 endotypes/groups of spinal progression.
However, clinical variables poorly discriminated patients who developed severe spinal disease compared to
the other spinal disease groups. Our goals in this proposal are to i) characterize the peripheral blood
molecular profile of AS spinal disease and ii) develop prediction tools combining clinical and molecular
biomarkers prognosticate AS spinal disease before irreversible damage has occurred.
The PI's preliminary data indicate that peripheral blood molecular markers in combination with genetic and
clinical variables improve prognostication of long-term spinal outcomes. Aim 1 of the proposal is designed to
further profile the transcriptomic signatures associated with AS spinal disease progression through next-
generation bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing. Aim 2 will use high-throughput proteomics to profile AS
patients' sera with known AS spinal trajectories. Aim 3 will use Bayesian multivariable modeling and
Integrative analysis of clinical, genetic, gene expression and proteomic datasets to generate prediction models
of AS patients' risk of severe spinal disease.
The Pl is an MD Rheumatologist with the long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator focused on
AS pathogenesis and outcomes. The proposed research and training plan will help the Pl to develop
proficiency in analyses of molecular data and in systems medicine modeling. Equally important are the career
development goals of enhancing skills in data presentation, grant writing and project management in
preparation for scientific independence. These goals will be achieved through a combination of mentorship,
formal didactic instruction, and experimentation. The work will be performed in an excellent institutional
environment with mentorship from Dr.Shervin Assassi, a leader in molecular profiling in systemic sclerosis, and
additional guidance from co-mentors with expertise in ankylosing spondylitis, bioinformatics and immunology.
This award will accelerate the Pl's research as well as career development into an independent and productive

This NIH K23 proposal details a comprehensive five-year training plan for mentored patient-oriented research
career development and research to address a major problem in neuromuscular medicine. Over half of patients
with clinically suspected Mendelian myopathies do not have a molecular diagnosis, largely due to two challenges:
detecting pathogenic non-coding variants, and resolving the pathogenicity of ultra-rare missense variants. Here
I propose to address this challenge through the application of genome sequencing (Aim 1), transcriptome
sequencing (Aim 2), and proteomic (Aim 3) methods to evaluate the strengths and weakness of each method
and to improve the diagnostic yield from a cohort of approximately 200 individuals with unsolved Mendelian
myopathies. I hypothesize that since the genetic architecture of Mendelian myopathies implicates large genes
that genome sequencing combined with RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and proteomics can mitigate the current
low diagnostic yield after clinical evaluation of Mendelian myopathies. Through these approaches, I will define
best practices in applying technologies in the diagnostic evaluation, discover novel disease variants and genes,
and expand our understanding of the genetic architecture of these heterogeneous disorders.
Gaining the analytical skills to evaluate the real-world application of multiomic methods will complement both my
prior expertise in gene discovery for neurologic disorders and my clinical training in neuromuscular medicine. I
am uniquely positioned within the collaborative environment between Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston
Children’s Hospital, Broad Institute, and Harvard Medical School to facilitate my transition to an independent
physician-scientist with a long-term translational research goal of developing a center of excellence in the clinical
characterization, molecular diagnosis, and evaluation of targeted gene therapy candidates for patients with
Mendelian myopathies."

Of the recognized infection-associated malignancies, the most significant carcinogenic microbe is the gastric
bacterium Helicobacter pylori, which chronically colonizes the stomach of over half of the global population and
contributes to the development of more than one million new cases of cancer per year. Despite many decades
of research, we do not fully understand how H. pylori balances interactions with the human host to stimulate the
development of gastric disease. The cancer-associated H. pylori cag type IV secretion system (cag T4SS) has
emerged as a paradigm for understanding how a single molecular device transports diverse immunostimulatory
cargo into target eukaryotic cells. Whereas some T4SSs have the capacity to secrete multiple protein effectors,
the ability to translocate a pro-inflammatory bacterial oncoprotein and a repertoire of DNA and polysaccharide
substrates distinguishes the cag T4SS from other nanomachines. In exciting new studies, we discovered that
cag T4SS-dependent trans-kingdom DNA conjugation stimulates cytosolic nucleic acid reconnaissance systems
to provoke the production of multifarious interferons and inflammatory cytokines that orchestrate diverse immune
responses. Our long-term objective is to mechanistically characterize how the dynamic cag T4SS transports
carcinogenic molecular cargo into gastric cells. Towards our objective, we aim to define the kinetics and
biogeography of cag T4SS-dependent DNA translocation in vivo and delineate the mechanism by which
chromosomal DNA cargo is excised and coupled to the cag T4SS apparatus. Our studies will employ rodent
infection models, high-resolution microscopy, biochemical approaches, and immunological assays to address
longstanding knowledge gaps in gastric cancer biology and uncover microbial mechanisms that are involved in
the development of pre-malignant lesions. Collectively, these investigations will advance our understanding of
important host-pathogen conflicts that engage nucleic acid surveillance pathways to regulate host immunity and
trigger microbial carcinogenesis. Furthermore, our studies will provide the foundational framework for developing
new treatment and intervention strategies to reduce the incidence and severity of malignancies that arise as a
consequence of infection-induced chronic inflammation."

Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML) is a lethal subtype of leukemia characterized by cytopenias, marrow
dysplasia, monocytosis, and a propensity for transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Until this R37
parent grant, no mouse model of CMML, to include genetically engineered mice harboring CMML mutations,
had recapitulated the unique clinical or histological characteristics of the human disease. We have overcome
this limitation and generated phenotypically and genetically accurate PDX models of 92 CMML patients through
the use of modified NOD/SCID IL2R null (NSG) mouse strains expressing human cytokines that uniquely drive
CMML. Moreover, we have utilized these PDX models to identify novel therapies targeting aberrant cytokine-
signaling characteristics and mRNA splicing in specific genetic subsets of CMML. In this R37 extension we
propose to leverage our CMML PDX model to study a previously unrecognized observation we have made that
approximately 20% of CMML patients harbor a very small concomitant mast cell clone. Because these cases
are clinically and genetically unique, we hypothesize that there may be an ongoing but unknown biologic
cooperativity in these patients. However, to study this accurately, new in vivo systems are needed to model this
clone-to-clone communication. We aim to achieve this with our CMML PDX models in two specific aims: In Aim
1 we will generate the first hybrid CMML PDX in which mast cells will be additionally heterotopically xenografted
with the goal of modeling clone-to-clone communication. Because our preliminary data suggest that subclonal
mast cells may be derived from the same ancestral stem cell as CMML, we will also retrospectively determine if
CMML and de novo mast cells were previously xenografted in CMML PDX models already generated from
patients with occult subclonal mast cells. Last, we will use these models to identify secreted factors and annotate
the clonal architecture of these patients at single cell resolution. In Aim 2 we will determine if SF3B1 mutated
clones have distinct biologic cooperativity and secreted factors. Our preliminary clinical data suggests that
SF3B1 mutations are enriched in patients with subclonal mast cells. We hypothesize that this is due to a unique
genotype specific cooperativity. We will evaluate this by xenografting isogenic leukemic cells with and without
SF3B1 mutation in the context of a concomitant mast cell tumor. We will also compare CMML PDX models with
and without concomitant mast cell tumors in the context of SF3B1 mutation generated in aim 1. Last, we will
compare the secreted factors and clonal trajectories identified in Aim 1 in SF3B1 mutant versus wild type CMML
PDX. Collectively, this extension will build on the parent grant by using our CMML PDX model to explore novel
biology that could translate to a better understanding of the disease and novel therapeutic strategies."

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by excessive deposition of fat in the liver, is the most
common pediatric liver disease (~13% prevalence among 2-19 years old) and is exacerbated by obesity and
insulin resistance. Presently, there are no treatment options for pediatric NAFLD that produce meaningful and
durable hepatic fat reductions. Pharmacotherapy may be able to close the tremendous gap in clinical care.
Sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) represent an attractive and potentially effective treatment
option for NAFLD with supportive data in adults and animal models but has yet to be examined in pediatrics. In
adults with type 2 diabetes and obesity, SGLT2i medications reduce body weight, improve insulin sensitivity, and
decrease hepatic fat. Unlike adults, the vast majority of adolescents with obesity and NAFLD are insulin resistant
but have yet to develop type 2 diabetes. Thus, the pediatric population is ideal to test the first central hypothesis
that SGLT2i therapy drives reductions of hepatic fat in the absence of diabetes. SGLT2i paradoxically increases
fasting endogenous glucose production (EGP), which is not commonly encountered with other insulin sensitization
medications. Therefore, the second central hypothesis is that SGLT2i augments hepatic mitochondrial fatty acid
beta-oxidation, producing the acetyl-CoA that stimulates gluconeogenesis-derived EGP in a pediatric, non-
diabetic population. The collaborative transdisciplinary team is uniquely positioned to leverage a randomized,
controlled trial to test whether the SGLT2i empagliflozin may be a successful treatment for pediatric NAFLD. A
focused, mechanistic clinical trial will be performed studying older adolescents (ages 16-≤20 years; n=40) with
MRI-determined NAFLD (hepatic fat ≥5.5%) and obesity (BMI ≥30kg/m2) without T2D, to examine the response
to 10mg, once-daily oral dose of empagliflozin for 26-weeks to identify mechanisms of action and initial efficacy
of the SGLT2i agent empagliflozin as a treatment for pediatric NAFLD, through the following Specific Aims: (1)
Use SGLT2i treatment to quantify the dynamic relationship between hepatic fat content and insulin sensitivity in
an adolescent population. Gold-standard 2-stage hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps and MRI-determined
NAFLD will be used to determine whether SGLT2i driven reductions in hepatic fat are associated with the degree
of improvement in both hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity. (2) To determine the mechanisms through which
SGLT2 inhibition decreases hepatic fat content. Non-invasively delivered dual stable isotope tracers and magnetic
resonance spectroscopy-based methods will be used to quantify adipose tissue lipolysis, hepatic fat oxidation
(both terminal oxidation and ketogenesis), and the gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic components of EGP, to
determine whether the degree of hepatic fat reduction correlates with the degree to which SGLT2i drives hepatic
fat oxidation. This study represents a novel and innovative investigation into a promising medical therapy for a
highly prevalent disease in the pediatric population, which currently has limited treatment options."

Title: Molecular Mechanism of the Cytoplasmic Dynein-Dynactin Motor Complex
Our long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the cytoplasmic dynein-dynactin motor complex,
and to define the molecular bases of dynein-related diseases in humans. The microtubule motor cytoplasmic
dynein, in cooperation with its regulatory proteins, drives several processes essential to embryonic
development, including neuronal proliferation, neuronal migration, and the transport of numerous intracellular
cargoes. Thus, it is not surprising dysfunction of dynein contributes to birth defects. A striking example is
lissencephaly (LIS), a rare, but devastating brain malformation. Variants of this diseases are caused by loss or
mutation of the dynein regulator Lis1. In lissencephaly, neurons fail to migrate properly during development
and affected infants’ brains lack the normal gyral folding pattern and layering of the cerebral cortex. These
children suffer untreatable epilepsy and severe psychomotor retardation, often dying in the first year of life.
Unfortunately, mechanistic insights into dynein function and its regulation by Lis1 are limited, hampering our
ability to understand the molecular basis for LIS, and other dynein-linked human diseases. In this proposal, we
will combine single-molecule fluorescence and optical tweezers-based force measurements with innovative
protein engineering to determine how cytoplasmic dynein in complex with its activator dynactin and the cargo
adaptor bicaudal D (BicD), is regulated by Lis1. We will decipher how Lis1 regulates the motion and force
generation of the dynein-dynactin-BicD (DDB) motor complex, and determine the effects of human disease
mutations on Lis1-DDB function. These studies will provide a new understanding of dynein-linked diseases,
and elucidate molecular targets for future therapeutic interventions."

 Nearly half of US adults have hypertension. Fructose intake predisposes to salt-sensitive hypertension, an
independent risk factor for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Increased salt intake impairs vascular compliance even before frank hypertension develops. Aortic stiffness is
now recognized as a robust predictor of MACE and CKD. Sympathoexcitation increases cardiovascular risk and
strongly impacts aortic stiffness. Our preliminary data show that combined fructose and salt intake contributes
to insulin resistance and hypertension that displays increased renal sympathetic activity and aortic as well as
renal artery stiffness. The goal of this application is to achieve early identification and timely intervention of
vascular stiffness to mitigate MACE and CKD. Robust, rigorous preclinical data are needed to justify testing and
treatment. Our central hypothesis is that a diet moderately high in fructose and salt (FHS) results in hypertension,
vascular stiffness and renal dysfunction driven by sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and/or the renin-angiotensin-
system (RAS). We propose to interrogate the mechanism that this neuroexcitation and increased RAS are driven
by afferent inputs from the kidney to the brain at the subfornical organ and, thence, to SNA and/or
angiotensinergic inputs to heart, vasculature and kidney. Direct interruption of the afferent renal nerves, SNA or
pharmacological inhibition of SNA or RAS, alone or in combination, will decrease blood pressure, conduit
vascular compliance, and ameliorate cardiac and renal function. We propose three aims: 1) ascertain the
respective contribution of afferent vs efferent renal nerves on blood pressure, LV function, vascular compliance,
and renal function in FHS rat model, 2) assess the impact of acute or chronic pharmacologic blockade of SNA
and/or RAS on LV function, vascular compliance and renal function in FHS rats, and 3) evaluate the contribution
of the arterial baroreflex, AT1R and TNFR1 in the subfornical organ that lies outside the blood brain barrier on
blood pressure, LV-GLS, PP, PWV, RRI and renal function in rats on FHS diet. RAS and aortic compliance
display sexual dimorphism, so we will evaluate Sprague Dawley rats of both sexes. We will use state-of-the-art
ultrasonography, real-time renal blood flow and FITC-sinistrin measurements of glomerular filtration rate to
assess aortic and renal artery compliance, LV and renal function. We will directly assess the impact of afferent
and efferent renal nerves with selective deafferentation vs total denervation in conscious rats. We will validate
the in vivo findings by ex vivo myography of aortic rings and assess markers of oxidative stress in vasculature.
We will test whether chronic pharmacologic therapies to inhibit sympathetic inputs and/or RAS will also achieve
improvements in conduit vascular compliance, cardiac and renal function. Our studies will identify therapeutic
interventions that can be translated to screening and treatment of humans with pre-diabetes and stage 1
hypertension to improve vascular and renal function to mitigate MACE and CKD.

10815765,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Excessive alcohol use presents a serious public health problem and increases risk for many preventable chronic
diseases. The cognitive and neural mechanisms that promote this problematic drinking behavior, especially
through alcohol-related memories, are not well understood. What people remember about their prior experiences
using alcohol may drive later drinking. In particular, there may be biases in what heavy drinkers (compared to
light drinkers) remember about drinking experiences. For example, alcohol-related cues elicit different neural
responses in memory-related regions between these groups. Crucially, there are multiple memory systems,
supported by distinct neural circuits and optimized to remember different types of information, which can be
modulated by biological stress responses (known to be atypical among binge/heavy drinkers). There is a
pressing need to understand how different types of alcohol-related memories are formed, influenced by stress
responses, and predict drinking behavior. The research and training proposed in this K01 provides an ideal
interdisciplinary opportunity to facilitate the candidate’s career growth into an independent scientist focusing on
memory and affective mechanisms underlying the development of alcoholism. The proposed research elucidates
the cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms underlying the formation of alcohol-related memories in
problematic drinkers. This proposal builds upon the candidate’s expertise in the cognitive neuroscience of stress
and memory and provides essential training in the neurobiology of alcoholism, computational modeling of neural
mechanisms supporting alcohol-related learning, and predicting longitudinal repeated-measures drinking
behavior. The team of mentors and collaborators are leaders in these fields and, together with the stimulating
and collaborative environment of Yale School of Medicine, will prepare the candidate for an independent career
at the interface of cognitive neuroscience and alcoholism research. The central research hypothesis is that
binge/heavy drinkers have impaired memory for alcohol-related contexts and enhanced memory for cued
behaviors, associated with elevated stress responses and predictive of greater levels of drinking. To test this
hypothesis, functional neuroimaging (fMRI) data will be collected as light and binge/heavy drinkers learn and
retrieve alcohol-related contexts and habit-like cued behaviors. Stress responses (via salivary cortisol) will be
measured during learning and retrieval, and real-world drinking behavior will be monitored using smartphone
prompts for 30 days after the fMRI sessions. This comprehensive design enables the characterization of: 1)
biases in how risky drinkers form and retrieve alcohol-related memories; 2) how stress hormones contribute to
the formation of these memories; and 3) which types of alcohol-related memory predict real-world drinking
behavior. Successful completion of this project will address critical gaps in the candidate’s training and has the
potential to reveal novel memory-related behavioral and neural markers of excessive alcohol use to ultimately
facilitate the design of targeted memory-based treatments to mitigate alcoholism risk."
10823504,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The rise in cannabis use during pregnancy has become of increasing concern due to the direct fetal exposure of
the psychoactive component Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). During the third trimester of gestation, the brain
undergoes a ‘growth spurt’ where cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB1Rs) increase in density. It has been
suggested that endocannabinoids (eCBs) play a role in both synapse formation and the maintenance of synaptic
plasticity, so understanding the effect of increased cannabis exposure is crucial for explaining the mechanisms
of experience-dependent plasticity during the critical period. Furthermore, chronic THC exposure has been
shown to result in desensitization and internalization of CB1Rs soon after chronic THC exposure. Few
experiments have used animal models to study the effects of THC exposure during brain development and its
long-term effects on CB1R function and expression.
Preliminary data from the Medina lab suggests that prenatal THC exposure during the third trimester equivalent
of human gestation in ferrets increases the density of CB1Rs in neurons in the primary visual cortex and leads
to a larger shift in ocular dominance plasticity (ODP), contrary to prenatal alcohol exposure. Thus, we
hypothesize that prenatal exposure to THC during the equivalent of the third trimester of human gestation leads
to a reduction in expression and function of CB1Rs during the first days after exposure followed by a “rebound”
where expression and function of these receptors increases. These changes in CB1R expression and function
will initially reduce (at P34) and posteriorly increase (at P48) ODP. To test this hypothesis, in Aim 1.1 we will use
RNAscope in THC-exposed and control ferrets to determine if there is a decrease in CB1R expression in neurons
in V1 at P34. In Aim 1.2 we will use whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology in these groups to determine a
change in the number of functional CB1Rs, specifically measuring inhibitory and excitatory post synaptic currents
(IPSCs and EPSCs) at P34. We will use in vivo electrophysiology in Aim 1.3 to determine impairment in ODP at
P34. We will again use RNAscope in Aim 2.1 to determine if there is an increase in CB1R expression at P48 in
THC-treated ferret V1. In Aim 2.2 we will use whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology to determine if chronic
THC exposure leads to an increase in functional CB1Rs, specifically measuring IPSCs and EPSCs. Finally, we
will use in vivo electrophysiology in Aim 2.3 to determine if chronic THC exposure facilitates ODP and results in
a larger shift in ocular dominance at P48, as shown in our preliminary data.
We are confident in our approach based on previous literature, preliminary data, and our success in establishing
a novel prenatal THC exposure model in ferrets. This proposal utilizes this novel animal model to investigate a
problem of growing national concern using multiple technical approaches and will allow for the growth of the PI

10823634,"Investigating the Impact of Epigenetic Heterogeneity on Hematopoiesis
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) generate all blood and immune cell types of the body, and proper control of
their self-renewal and differentiation is essential for human health.1,2 Since the work of Till and McCulloch,
heterogeneity has been recognized to be a cardinal feature of HSC biology. Clonally related cells can differ in
their lineage decisions and showed preference towards certain cell fates, even in identical environments.1–6
Researchers termed these skewed decisions as “lineage bias”. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as post-
translational histone modifications (`histone marks'), are postulated to be a possible factor contributing to
individual HSCs heterogeneity and its lineage bias. For example, recent studies suggest that levels of repressive
histone marks at silent gene loci can vary considerably from cell-to-cell and repressive histone marks such as
H3K27me3 can be stably inherited through generations. Since lineage-specifying genes involved in
hematopoiesis are typically held in a repressive state until differentiation, I hypothesize that individual HSCs
show substantial epigenetic state heterogeneity at lineage-specifying gene loci and that this epigenetic
heterogeneity creates stable, heritable lineage biases in these cells. To test this hypothesis, I will determine the
extent of epigenetic heterogeneity present in HSCs, as well as whether it impacts lineage potential for HSCs.
Both of these questions remain unclear due to the lack of methods that can measure epigenetic states consisting
of an array of histone marks and their dynamics within single cells. Recently, the Vaughan and Kueh group
developed a methodology termed Single-Cell Evaluation of Post Translational Epigenetic encoding (SCEPTRE),
which uses super resolution microscopy to resolve and quantify multiple histone marks at specific gene loci of
interest simultaneously. I will use SCEPTRE to investigate the extent of epigenetic heterogeneity present in
HSCs and its descendants (Aim1) first. Then, I will interrogate the heritability and impact of repressive epigenetic
states by coupling SCEPTRE with live-cell tracking (Aim2). If successful, the project will provide an exciting first
look into epigenetic regulation in HSCs at the single-cell level, paving the way for downstream studies to reveal
fundamental aspects of their control and action."
10825553,"T cell activation is initiated by direct contact between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs), leading to
polarization of the T cell towards the APC and the formation of the immunological synapse (IS). It is now generally
accepted that Ca2+ signals are required for T cell activation. Further, reorganization of Ca2+ signaling proteins
during IS formation has been widely reported, although the underlying mechanisms driving this event are poorly
described as is the physiological significance of this reorganization. Unpublished observations from our group,
reveal that translocation to the IS is highly dependent upon a polybasic region at its C-terminus, with neutralization of any positive charges sufficient to block STIM1 polarization. Further, whereas cytosolic Ca2+ entry was
normal in cells expressing these STIM1 mutants, mitochondrial Ca2+ loading and mROS production were defective. Further, Septins, a family of GTP-binding and complex forming proteins known to affect STIM1 localization
through reorganization of phosphoinositides around ER-PM junctions, localize to the IS in a STIM1-dependent
manner. Based on these preliminary findings, we propose the following hypothesis: Septin-mediated reorganization of Phosphatidylinositides control polarization of STIM1 and associated proteins towards the IS, driving
mitochondrial Ca2+ loading, critical for metabolic reprogramming and T cell differentiation. This proposal is organized into 3 aims: Aim 1: Define the mechanisms and role of STIM1 translocation during IS formation.
Here, we will i. define the role of STIM1 polarization on IS formation, including examining the translocation of
STIM1 target proteins towards the IS and ii. determine the impact of loss of polarization on mitochondrial function. Aim 2: Assess interdependence between STIM1 and septins during IS formation. Here, we will use
Septin4/5-KO cells to determine their contribution to Ca2+ entry and clearance and downstream signaling during
T cell activation. In addition, we will use site-directed mutagenesis to eliminate GTPase function and then reexpress in KO cells. Implications to the localization of STIM1, STIM1 mutants and STIM1-associated proteins
Orai1, PMCA4 and POST will be determined. Finally, we will determine the relationship between Septins and
STIM1 on phosphoinositide localization during T cell activation. Aim 3: Role of STIM1 polarization on primary
T cell activation. Here, we will use adoptive transfer to generate primary T cells expressing either STIM1WT or
STIM1K672M. This will facilitate extending our work to include assessing how the failure of STIM1 to translocate
to the IS affects T cell differentiation, cytokine production, expansion and elimination. These investigations will
provide new insights into cellular mechanisms regulating STIM1 localization and function, particularly within the
context of T cell activation. Completion of this work could have numerous applications, particularly given recent
progress in immunology. Hence, the efficiency of IS formation determines the quality and nature of the immune
response, with potential implications to the treatment of numerous autoimmune diseases and cancer immunology."
10825554,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Autoimmunity is defined as the loss of tolerance to self-antigen resulting in the targeted destruction of tissue by
immune cells. Autoimmune conditions are on the rise globally while our knowledge on how autoimmunity
emerges is still limited. The thymus is a highly structured organ that is essential for T cell development and
education. The nature of the gene rearrangements on the T cell receptor (TCR) allows for recognition of self and
non-self-antigens. Positive selection occurs in the thymus cortex where thymocytes receive survival signals when
selected against self-antigen by cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs). Negative selection occurs in the thymus
medulla driven by medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), and a diverse repertoire of antigen presenting cells
(APCs) including different subsets of dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells. The signaling strength of the tri-molecular
complex (TCR-peptide-MHC) between APCs and thymocytes dictates cell fate. Thymocytes who react too
strongly to self-antigens are deleted, become anergic or divert to regulatory T cell (Treg) lineage. In optimal
conditions T cell selection prevents the release of autoreactive T cell clones to the periphery a critical process to
prevent the onset of autoimmunity. However, the mechanisms behind the escape of autoreactive T cells to
the periphery in autoimmune conditions are poorly understood, and the study of T cell education in a
primary lymphoid organ is not feasible in humans. Mouse models have demonstrated to be powerful tools
in thymus studies, as several developmental and functional mechanisms are evolutionary conserved. Migratory
and resident APCs are known to drive clonal deletion and Treg lineage in both the humans and mice. CX3CR1
is expressed in a subset of tolerogenic B cells and Mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs): DCs, macrophages and
monocytes. CX3CR1+ APCs present antigen to CD4+ T cells in peripheral organs. CX3CR1+ APCs in the gut
induce differentiation of peripheral Tregs via transcription factor Foxp3. The close interaction of CX3CR1+ APCs
with CD4+ T cells in the periphery lead us to hypothesize whether a similar population of CX3CR1+ APCs resides
in the thymus to drive selection of T cells and may play a role in thymic Treg development. Our preliminary data
shows a population of CX3CR1+ APCs in the thymus capable of antigen specific stimulation of CD4+ T cells in
vitro. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to understand how autoreactive T cells develop and
escape selection mechanisms in the thymus driven by CX3CR1+ APCs and ultimately drive the
emergence of autoimmune disease. Our studies aim to investigate the contribution of APCs to central T cell
tolerance with the goal of finding potential new targets for treatment of autoimmune disease."

Recent data from clinical trials with humanized or fully human mAbs targeting Aβ suggest that immunotherapy
could clear/reduce brain amyloid plaques and even slow cognitive decline in vaccinated subjects when initiated
as a preventive measure. However, passive immunotherapy with even the most effective anti-Aβ mAb is not
practical and cost-effective as a preventive measure in healthy subjects due to the need for frequent (monthly)
administrations of high concentrations (~800mg IV injections/each time) of this immunotherapeutic in a
substantial patient population. At the same time, high doses of mAb frequently (~30%) induce ARIA-E and ARIA-
H. In contrast, AD vaccine, similar to the vast majority of vaccines in general, could be very effective when used
as a preventive/early intervention measure. Today, only limited results are available from ACC001, CAD106,
and UB311 epitope vaccine clinical trials, but fortunately, comprehensive data on AN-1792 are published. These
data demonstrated that the AN-1792 vaccine has induced antibodies specific to N-terminus of amyloid in ~19%
immunized AD patients without causing ARIA-E and ARIA-H abnormalities. Importantly the follow-up analysis
revealed that even after 14 years post-vaccination, the vaccinated subjects were plaque-free, and there was a
significant inverse correlation between peripheral blood anti-Aβ antibody titers and the plaque counts. Despite
the reduction of Aβ pathology, vaccination did not improve cognitive functions likely due to tau pathology buildup.
These data support our long-standing proposal of starting anti-Aβ vaccination with AV-1959D as a prophylactic
measure in subjects at risk for AD to inhibit/reduce oligomerization of Aβ and delay downstream pathological
processes. However, based on an ethical imperative raised by the FDA during our pre-IND meeting, they
recommended us to test our Aβ vaccine AV-1959D in participants with early-stage AD patients prior to initiating
the preventive trials in asymptomatic people at risk of MCI/AD. Therefore, here we propose to initiate a Phase 1
safety trial with the first-in-human Aβ DNA vaccine, AV-1959D in early-stage MCI/AD patients based on FDA
cleared IND18953 developed under an NIA cooperative agreement (U01 AG048310). Importantly, our vaccine
strategy differs from all previous or current vaccines tested in clinical trials, as our approach is based on the very
immunogenic and proprietary MultiTEP platform designed for human use and aimed to (i) overcome self-
tolerance by inducing Th cell responses to MultiTEP, but not to self-Aβ epitopes; (ii) diminish variability of immune
responses due to HLA diversity in humans; (iii) augment anti-Aβ antibody production through activation of both
naïve and pre-existing memory Th cells, especially beneficial for elderly patients with immunosenescence.
Therefore, in Phase 1 trials, the first-in-human MultiTEP-based DNA vaccine targeting Aβ1-11 B cell epitope
should be safe and should induce therapeutically sufficient titers of anti-Aβ antibodies in an appreciable number
of vaccinated early stage AD subjects. Our future program includes preventive vaccine trial in asymptomatic
people at risk of MCI/AD using only the most immunogenic and safe dose of AV-1959D."

AtlasXomics Inc. is commercializing the next generation of spatial biology tools to help
researchers understand the epigenetic mechanisms of disease. The goal of this SBIR grant is to
commercialize a product suite of hardware, consumables, and software to spatially interrogate
tissue and generate a new layer of data for better understanding gene expression modulation in
tissue. The development of novel research tools is critical to address the significant healthcare
burden posed by cancer and cardiovascular disease. Epigenetic dysregulation plays a significant
role in disease development and response to therapy, but current technologies are inadequate
for capturing epigenetic changes in interacting cell populations. AtlasXomics developed and
established proof-of-concept performance of the spatial ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase
Accessible Chromatin) assay. In the Phase I, AtlasXomics successfully transferred the academic
protocol into a commercial workflow and met industry standards for ATAC-seq quality in mouse
and human cancer tissues. The Company introduced the first commercial epigenomics assay to
the market in June 2022.
In this proposed Phase II, the Company will increase the price performance of the assay to
address feedback from customers and prospects: cover a larger area of tissue, increase cellular
resolution, and establish a user-friendly, interactive data analysis suite that enables researchers
to seamlessly analyze data. The product of this SBIR will be an all-in-one kit that integrates a
suite of hardware, consumables, and bioinformatics tools to enable scientists to explore the
epigenetic dimension of disease pathology., e.g., characterize tumor and immune cells spatially
in the tissue microenvironment. The product will democratize broad adoption of the spatial
epigenomics platform because it does not require costly custom equipment and the proposed
bioinformatics workflow will also simplify the analysis of the large epigenomics datasets generated
by the assay. This product will help scientists to gain biological insight into the spatial epigenetic
mechanisms that drive disease progression and therapy response."

Uroflowmetry is the most common urodynamic test performed by urologists to assess the function of the lower
urinary tract. This simple non-invasive study measures urinary flow rates and when summarized graphically
offers insights into various types of lower urinary tract symptoms. Current systems call upon a patient to void
into a commode with a funnel to direct the flow of urine into a vessel placed on a digital scale which in turn
drives its output into a processor. The processor is connected to a printer which produces summary data
such as voided volume, peak flow, average flow, total void time, as well as a graphical representation of the
flow curve anywhere from 20-30 seconds after the void is initiated or completed. The physician or their
assistant will then empty the vessel, and the system can be used again. Traditionally the paper containing the
printed collected data was filed into a paper chart. Today this tracing is taped to a 2nd paper containing the
patient’s name and medical record number, and this is scanned into the electronic record as an image and the
data become non-searchable. Given this labor intensive process which is restricted to the office, conventional
uroflowmetry is ripe for disruptive innovations that will allow for testing in the patient’s home or office with the
data being driven into the electronic medical record (EMR).
We seek to offer a service to address to these logistical problems based on a detector that is paired with
customized software. Our detector fits in any regular toilet (it can be used in an office setting or at home by
males and females). Uroflow data are acquired in real time by a blue tooth or tablet, which sends the data to
the UroGenie cloud based server, and the summary data is delivered into the EMR. This will allow for a
physician to review multiple flows over time to monitor a patient’s progress without having to open up each
individual image. In this proposal we seek to refine our detector, and modify the software to work in the
home market, and test the service in both office and home locations. Once this system is fully operational we
envision this system being used in office and home settings, and playing a role in drug trials for lower urinary
tract symptoms. The instantaneous detection of flow rate also means it has the potential for future
applications in biofeedback training for selected patients with specific lower urinary tract symptoms."
10932971,"PROJECT SUMMARY – SEX DIFFERENCES IN NEURAL CIRCUIT MECHANISMS OF AGGRESSION
Aggression is a necessary, adaptive component of social behavior; however, it can become escalated and may
threaten lives, increase the risk of developing psychiatric disease in victims, and incur tremendous economic
burdens on society. Even though aggression can have such dramatic effects on the health and well-being of our
society, we have very few treatments, owing to our still limited understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms
driving aggression. In this application we first take an unbiased computational approach to identify novel circuit
mechanisms of aggression. Using an iDISCO+ tissue clearing method, we broadly assessed cFos expression—
an immediate early gene (IEG) induced by neural activity—across the entire brain to identify brain regions
differentially activated following aggressive versus non-aggressive social interaction. We assessed cFos in ~500
brain regions—registered to the Allen brain atlas—simultaneously and examined interactions across brain
regions by generating co-expression networks with weighted correlation network analysis (WCNA), a widely
used data mining method for studying biological networks based on pairwise correlations between variables. In
this case we examined correlations between cFos expression in brain regions and ranked the correlations based
on the strength of the correlation and the number of total connections. One of the most strongly interconnected
networks was within the amygdala, which is made up of a highly heterogenous cluster of brain regions and cell
types that perform a diverse range of functions from controlling anxiety and fear to social behavior and reward.
Using advanced Ca2+ imaging and chemogenetics, we found that activation of Esr1 glutamatergic neurons in the
COAp of males during aggression was necessary for aggressive behavior. Chemogenetic inhibition of these
cells increased pro-social investigation during the resident intruder (RI) test, however, it did not occlude pro-
social reward/reinforcement behavior. For example, we found that previously aggressive mice will actively lever
press for an intruder mouse; not to attack to the intruder, but to engage in pro-social interactions with them.
Conversely, in females we find that activation of COAp neurons is necessary for pro-social encounters during
the RI test. Thus, our data suggests that the COAp may serve as an important switch in both sexes—though in
sexually dimorphic ways—to control the motivation to engage in pro- versus aggressive-social behavior. Based
on our strong pilot data, we have designed a series of studies to better understand this phenomenon and fully
characterize the role of COAp circuitry in mediating aggression and pro-social behavior. We will use
chemogenetics/optogenetics, electrophysiology and in vivo Ca2+ imaging to dissect the role of COAp and
downstream circuits in mediating aggression and pro-social behavior in both male and female mice. We believe
that these studies will provide an important understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms governing social
behavior."
10806795,"Experimental data linking thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) inspired our
clinical trial, which generated preliminary evidence that pharmacological thiamine produced by the drug
benfotiamine provides clinical benefit. We hypothesize that pharmacological thiamine is protective by diminishing
the formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGE). AGE are proteins and lipids that become glycated and
harmful following exposure to reducing sugars. AGE cause irreversible damage to biological macromolecules by
altering their structural and functional integrity. Abundant evidence links AGE to AD. In AD animal models,
thiamine deficiency increases AGE and exacerbates plaques and tangle formation, while increased thiamine
diminishes AGE and pathology. In our pilot clinical trial, pharmacological thiamine levels diminished global
plasma AGE levels and improved symptoms in patients with AD. Interestingly, in AD patients, the effects of high
thiamine are diminished in patients carrying the APOE4 genotype, the most significant genetic risk factor for
sporadic AD. We postulate that this is because APOE4 increases unique AGE at earlier stages.
 Optimizing this therapeutic approach requires a better understanding of the mechanism underlying the
action of benfotiamine. All previous related AD and thiamine studies have utilized AGE antibody surveys. This
data is limited to a small range of AGE and provides no data on the proteins and specific sites modified with
glycation. We will provide this critical data by using multiple state-of-the-art mass spectrometric measures of
AGE. Global glycaproteomics will identify glycated proteins and specific sites of AGE modifications and AGE-
omics will identify a broad range of crosslinking and non-crosslinking AGE. A second major gap is the lack of
our understanding on how APOE4 modifies the response to thiamine. Novel APOE3 and APOE4 humanized
APP mouse models will allow us to test these interactions. We will test our hypotheses: (1) In AD autopsy
brains at different stages of the disease, AGE modifications are critical to the pathophysiology of AD in
an APOE-dependent manner. (2) In mouse models of AD, thiamine deficiency drives AD-like pathology
and memory loss by causing specific brain and blood AGE modifications which are modified by APOE
genotype. (3) In mouse models, benfotiamine is beneficial by diminishing specific AGE and the treatment
must be initiated at an earlier stage of disease in APOE4 mice.
 These studies will dramatically improve our understanding of the role of AGE in AD and its link to a treatment
of pharmacological thiamine levels. Defining the interaction of AGE and thiamine in the etiology and progression
of AD will enable the development of specific AGE signatures for targets of engagement for therapeutic trials
and as AD diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. These studies will define the differential effectiveness of
thiamine by APOE genotype and define the most effective therapeutic approach for APOE3 and consistently
hard to treat APOE4 carriers. We therefore expect this study will have a high impact on translational AD medicine."
10808913,"Despite of a great deal of effort by public and private institutions, we don't have a prophylactic vaccine
against HIV-1 or an eradication protocol to treat infected patients. Recently, laboratories all over the word have
reported an increase in the transmission of HIV-1 strains that are resistant to one or more components of the
antiretroviral (ART) cocktail. In order to find novel therapeutic targets, basic understanding of HIV-1 replication
is urgently needed. Early steps in the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) involve delivery of
the viral core into the cytoplasm of the host cell. The viral core is a conical structure composed of ~1500
monomers of the HIV-1 capsid protein, which houses the viral RNA genome. We studied HIV-1 uncoating,
reverse transcription, and nuclear import by exploiting the ability of different cellular factors to affect early
events of HIV-1 replication. “Uncoating” is the dissociation of monomeric capsids from the HIV-1 core. Proteins
and drugs that destabilize the HIV-1 core and accelerate uncoating in the cytosol prevent reverse transcription.
Consistent with the concept that reverse transcription is linked to uncoating, we have shown that genetic or
pharmacologic inhibition of reverse transcription prevents uncoating. During the previous funding period, we
found that cellular proteins that stabilize the HIV-1 core allow reverse transcription but not nuclear import.
These results support a model in which the HIV-1 core is a “container” that holds the elements required for
reverse transcription. Opening the “container” disrupts reverse transcription. Keeping the “container” closed
allows completion of reverse transcription but prevents nuclear import. These results suggest that core stability
is tightly modulated during infection. Cyclophilin A (CypA) accounts for up to 0.4% of cellular protein and
interacts with the HIV-1 capsid and core. However, the role that CypA plays in HIV-1 infection is not known.
Our preliminary data indicate that CypA depletion inhibits HIV-1 infection in primary CD4+ T cells by 100 fold,
supporting the use of this model to understand the role of CypA in HIV-1 infection. We hypothesize that CypA
functions as a central modulator of HIV-1 infection by controlling interactions between cellular factors
and the HIV-1 core during the early steps of HIV-1 infection. With the expert support of Dr. Hultquist, Dr.
Campbell, Dr. Luban and Dr. KewalRamani, the following specific aims will test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will
determine the mechanisms through which CypA modulates HIV-1 infection in human primary CD4+ T cells. Aim
2 will determine the effects of CypA on the HIV-1 capsid in the nucleus. Aim 3 will examine the roles of other
cyclophilins in HIV-1 replication. Aim 4 will determine the effects of the Nup358 cyclophilin domain (Cyp358) on
HIV-1 nuclear import. This proposal will address two important questions on the HIV-1 field: 1) The role of
CypA in HIV-1 replication, which has been elusive for 25 years, and 2) the role of nuclear capsid in HIV-1
productive infection."

Men who develop metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) invariably succumb to their disease.
Thus there is a pressing need for preclinical testing of new drugs and drug combinations for late-stage prostate
cancer. Among the molecular events associated with mCRPC, genetic aberrations in RB1 occur in about 20%
of prostate adenocarcinoma cases and 70% of neuroendocrine/small cell prostate cancer cases, and these
events drive prostate cancer castration resistance, lineage plasticity, and metastasis. Importantly, recent studies
have identified RB1 genomic alteration as the molecular factor most strongly associated with poor clinical
outcomes in patients with mCRPC, highlighting loss of RB function as a dominant driver of prostate cancer
lethality, and underscoring the critical need for the identification of potential therapeutic strategies targeting this
mechanism for the treatment of a sizable majority of lethal prostate cancer cases. To this end, we now have
exciting unpublished preliminary data demonstrating that RB1 disruptions significantly sensitize prostate cancer
cells to ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death that could be harnessed for cancer therapy. Mechanistically,
we have found that RB1-loss/E2F activation leads to upregulation of ACSL4, a key determinant of ferroptosis
sensitivity. Based on these compelling preliminary findings, we hypothesize that ferroptosis is an emerging cancer
vulnerability elicited by RB1 deficiency, and propose that targeting ferroptosis could represent a novel therapeutic
approach to the treatment of lethal RB1-deficient prostate cancer. Through a multidisciplinary approach combining
unique prostate cancer model systems, in vivo preclinical studies, omics technologies, and molecular and
pathological analyses, we aim to determine whether targeting ferroptosis represents an effective therapeutic
approach to treating lethal RB1-deficient prostate cancer. In Aim 1, we will determine in vivo the therapeutic
potential of ferroptosis induction in the treatment of lethal RB1-deficient prostate cancer using two distinct but
complementary RB1-deficient prostate cancer model systems, i.e., patient-derived xenograft models and
genetically engineered mouse models. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanisms underlying RB1-loss-
associated vulnerability to ferroptosis. In Aim 3, we will determine the correlation between RB and ferroptosis
markers in mCRPC samples.
This proposal is based on promising preliminary findings, and utilizes highly relevant prostate cancer model
systems and functional assays to test the in vivo therapeutic potential of ferroptosis inducers in the treatment of
lethal RB1-deficient prostate cancer. Successful completion of these investigations will delineate downstream
effectors of the RB/E2F pathway and provide novel insights into the contributions of RB to ferroptosis as well as
the preclinical data regarding efficacy, safety, and biomarkers required for the rational design of future clinical
trials targeting ferroptosis as a therapeutic strategy against lethal RB1-deficient prostate cancer."

My long-term goal is to develop innovative diagnostic and therapeutic methods for pediatric diseases in the
intensive care unit (ICU), using cutting-edge single-cell multi-omics techniques and machine learning
approaches. My previous research focused on identifying novel drugs, biomarkers, prognostic, and diagnostic
markers for various diseases and cancers using big data approaches. However, MODS in pediatric patients with
veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support has drawn my attention, as the survival
rate for severe MODS patients with ECMO support is very low and there are no clinical or molecular biomarkers
available to diagnose deterioration of MODS patients requiring ECMO support. To gain a deeper understanding
of the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with MODS deterioration who may require advanced life
support, I aim to utilize advanced single-cell multi-omics and machine learning approaches. My previous
research using bulk RNA-seq analysis on a small sample size showed that dysregulation of the immune response
and epigenetic variations are significant factors associated with MODS deterioration in patients requiring ECMO
support. However, a more detailed analysis using advanced single-cell multi-omics and machine learning is
needed. The objective of this award is to use cutting-edge single-cell multi-omics techniques to investigate the
cellular heterogeneity and their dynamics, as well as their transcriptional regulatory elements in MODS and
ECMO patients at two different time points. Furthermore, a machine learning approach along with bulk RNA-seq
will be implemented to identify crucial cells and genes associated with MODS patients’ deterioration who may
require ECMO support. The successful completion of this research will expand my knowledge in single-cell multi-
omics, statistics, machine learning approaches, immune responses, and pediatric diseases. I have gathered a
team of eight renowned experts in the fields of big data science, immunology, single-cell multi-omics, pediatrics
rare diseases, statistics, rare diseases, machine learning, and immunology to act as my mentors, advisors, and
collaborators. These experts include: Primary Mentor Dr. Bin Chen in translational bioinformatics from MSU, co-

Tang in machine learning and single-cell multi-omics from MSU, and Dr. Mei-Sze Chua in immunology from
Stanford University. With the support of my mentors, advisors, and collaborators, this award will prepare me to
develop a deeper understanding of MODS research and the application of single-cell multi-omics in translational

10931632,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Asian Americans (AA) are the fastest growing and most diverse racial/ethnic group in the US, recording a 81%
growth from 2000 to 2019. Counter to the “model minority myth,” the AA has broad variations in income,
education, and nativity status by subgroups. AAs also have unique and unequal patterns of health behaviors,
cardiometabolic conditions, endocrine dysfunction, cancer, and mental illness. We must also acknowledge the
lived experiences of the diverse AA populations: historical trauma, racism, re-adjusting to life in a new country
as immigrants or refugees, and navigating unfamiliar healthcare systems. Unfortunately, lack of disaggregated
data limited our understanding of allostatic load (AL) in the diverse AA populations. Therefore, we propose a
paradigm shift towards understanding the cumulative toll of chronic stress through the concept of allostatic load,
its behavioral and social-contextual correlates, and how AL manifests as chronic diseases among AAs, by Asian
ethnic subgroups. AL is a complex clinical construct that offers a unique lens into the cumulative toll of stress
and how it manifests as physiological and psychological dysfunctions (i.e. chronic conditions). Analyses of
disaggregate data are needed to uncover specific risk patterns by AA subgroups and reduce health disparities
through tailored interventions. The All of Us (AoU) Research Program provides unprecedented opportunities for
us to close the gaps in literature and advance scientific knowledge. Leveraging the diverse and inclusive AA
subsample (N = 12,408), we seek to model AL as a complex system to capture a more comprehensive extent of
health risk in AA subgroups, identify high-risk groups, and explore how AL as various chronic illnesses. All
analyses will be conducted in aggregate AA sample first and then in 4 ethnic/regional subgroups: East Asian
(Chinese, Japanese, Korean), Southeast Asian (Vietnamese, Cambodian, Hmong), South Asian (Indian,
Pakistan), and Filipino. The specific aims are as follows: Aim 1: To examine the physiological risk profiles and
how sociodemographic, behavioral, social-contextual, and acculturation-related factors are associated with AL
in aggregated Asian American (Aim 1a) and separate AA subgroups (East Asian, Southeast Asian, South Asian,
and Filipino Americans) (Aim 1b). Aim 2: To explore subgroup disparities in stress manifestations by examining
how AL is associated with multiple chronic conditions in aggregated (Aim 2a) and separate AA subgroups (East,
Southeast, South, and Filipino Americans) (Aim 2b). The proposed analyses will help identify clinically and socio-
demographically important subgroups of AAs at high risk for physiological and psychological dysregulation. With
dissemination activities jointly led by researchers and clinical/community stakeholders, this study will ultimately
guide future lifestyle and behavioral interventions to improve resilience in AAs and provide clinical implications
for a more personalized medicine to stress mitigation and chronic disease prevention."
10797359,"In this proposal, we propose studies to elucidate the basis of the hyper and hypoconnectivity observed in AD.
We will combine high resolution in vivo MRI imaging strategies with state-of the-art spatial proteomics. By
combining these methods, we will obtain these two types of data in the same animal, allowing us to incorporate
machine learning (ML) to build a model to define spatially distinct protein expression changes in regions of hyper
and hypoconnectivity over time. A recent MRI/PET imaging study suggested that tau tangles are responsible for
hypoconnectivity, while Ab plaques are responsible for hyperconnectivity. This intriguing hypothesis, based on
data from a heterogeneous group of patients, needs to be tested under carefully controlled conditions that can
only be obtained using animal models of AD. PET imaging identifies tau tangles and Ab plaques but cannot
determine which phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species are driving hypoconnectivity, nor can it determine the
contribution of soluble Ab42 to the hyperconnectivity. In the studies proposed in this application, we will test three
hypotheses: 1) Soluble Ab42 accumulation causes regions of hyperconnectivity. 2) A subset of soluble p-tau
species is responsible for hypoconnectivity. 3) Regions of hyper and hypoconnectivity exhibit distinct spatial
proteomic profiles that reflect early and late phases of the disease."

Fecal incontinence (accidental leakage of stools; FI) is a major medical illness, occurs in a significant
population of women (>7%) and is under reported. Most common cause of FI is childbirth related injury to the
external anal sphincter (EAS), pelvic floor muscles and pudendal nerve (PN) that innervates sphincter muscle
by a variety of mechanisms. Many FI patients show anatomical disruptions and impairment of EAS muscle
function. Our animal (rabbit) studies confirm these findings and further demonstrate abnormal healing with
increased fibrosis in the regenerating muscle after experimental injury. Our mechanistic studies show
upregulation of fibrosis network involving Wnt-β/ STAT-3 proteins and a novel central hub for multi-receptor
driven profibrogenic signaling, Gα-interacting vesicle-associated protein (GIV; also known as Girdin) in the
injured animals. We hypothesize that PN stretch/crush during childbirth impairs sphincter function and
sustained neurotrophic (using brain derived neurotrophic factor; BDNF) therapy would accelerate PN re-
growth. Innovative, multimodular therapies that target nerve and muscle regrowth would prevent EAS muscle
dysfunction. Our specific aims are to: i. evaluate efficacy of a novel BDNF sustained release formulation
in a dual injury (PN crush and EAS injury) model alone and 2. In combination with GIV- siRNA delivered as
sustained release lipid nanoparticle formulation (LNP). We will use a female rabbit model and several
novel approaches, 1; longitudinal assessment of in-vivo length tension function of the EAS muscle, 2; use of
BDNF for sustained neurotrophin delivery, 3; gene silencing (GIV siRNA) with LNP to modulate fibrogenic
signaling with a goal of improving sphincter function in our studies. Thus, our proposal is both conceptually
novel, and innovative (paving the way for new treatment strategies). Rabbits will be monitored for 180 days
and subjected to EMG, anal canal pressure and sphincter muscle thickness (using endoluminal ultrasound)
measurements at pre-determined time points to determine anatomical and functional recovery. All the animals
will be sacrificed at the end of the study and EAS tissues will be harvested to perform tissue analysis to
determine nerve and muscle regeneration. Use of sustained BDNF therapy to promote EAS function remains
unexplored, as does the beneficial role of this multimodal approach. We have enlisted international leaders in
these fields for this novel research and our team has all the expertise to conduct this innovative study. Our
proposal aligns with R21 goals intended to support high risk, high payoff research. We envision a strong
potential for translation where patients could benefit from a simple, one-time office procedure during which the
PN/EAS is injected with the proposed neurotrophin /siRNA (LNP) formulations using a transperineal approach
to prevent post-partum FI."
10809491,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Oxidative stress (OxS) is a biochemical process that leads to damage of cellular lipids when endogenous
redox homeostasis is disrupted. OxS is mechanistically linked with the physiology of aging and age-related
diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration, cancer, frailty, diabetes, and SARS-CoV-2. The
identification of biomarkers to measure OxS is thus of significant public health revelance in order to better
understand disease mechanisms and target potential therapies. F2-Isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs) are formed from
the oxidation of the cellular lipid arachidonic acid and considered to be excellent biomarkers of OxS. Currently,
F2- IsoPs are being used as outcome measures in more than 80 active clinical trials worldwide. Further, the
NIA- sponsored Interventions Testing Program (ITP) has identified nine agents that significantly increase
lifespan, and four of those agents are known to decrease F2-IsoPs. While F2-IsoPs have proven to be useful
biomarkers of OxS, our laboratory has obtained evidence to support the hypothesis that metabolites of F2-
IsoPs more accurately reflect endogenous OxS than unmetabolized F2-IsoPs in certain biological settings. Yet,
F2-IsoP metabolites are rarely quantified in clinical studies. F2-IsoP-like molecules (F-isoprostanoids) are
made from the oxidation of other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), including adrenic, eicosapentaenoic
(EPA), and docosahexaenoic acids. These compounds are proving to be useful biomarkers in
neurodegenerative conditions and age-related macular degeneration, but their metabolism has never been
studied. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that understanding the metabolism of F-isoprostanoids is
critical for the accurate and complete quantitation of these urinary biomarkers in aging and OxS-related
diseases. In Specific Aim 1, we will use human liver microsomes to identify metabolites of several F-
isoprosatnoid isomers generated from the free radical oxidation of PUFA. Metabolites will be identified using
mass spectrometry (MS). In Specific Aim 2, we will establish and validate a robust LC/MS method for the
quantification of F-isoprostanoid metabolites, from Specific Aim 1, in human urine. For this purpose, we will
utilize urine samples from The Fatty Acid Desaturase Activity, Fish Oil, and Colorectal Cancer Prevention
Study (FnADAFO), a randomized clinical trial that was completed in 2018 at Vanderbilt. Subjects recruited in
this study were supplemented with olive oil or marine fish oil for six months, so these urine samples are ideal
for validation of this metabolite quantification. We anticipate that the completion of this application will redefine
our understanding F2-IsoP metabolism and, for the first time, define a strategy to comprehensively assess this
important biomarker of lipid peroxidation. Overall, these studies will change how the field evaluates
endogenous OxS and lipid peroxidation, thus setting the stage for future applications examining the role of
isoprostanoids in human physiology and the pathogenesis of disease."

Preeclampsia (PE) remains a poorly understood, multiorgan vascular disease that is responsible for the death
of up to 50,000 women and 1 million infants per year. Defective placentation and an abnormal immune
microenvironment at the maternal-fetal interface are central to the etiology of PE. Specifically, insufficient
extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion and, in turn, incomplete remodeling of the uterine spiral arteries, limits
placental perfusion and provokes the systemic maternal vascular endothelial dysfunction hallmark of PE. The
nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) family of transcription factors is a master regulator of inflammatory responses
that promote EVT invasion. Yet, excessive NF-kB activation in the vascular endothelium can impair uterine
vasodilation and reduce uteroplacental blood flow. We recently identified a novel NF-κB variant (rs230511) that
is associated with PE. Here we will combine robust human physiological studies and CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing
to establish the functional importance of this NF-κB variant for inflammatory responses in pregnancy, and the
role of NF-κB more generally in PE. We hypothesize that rs230511 increases PE risk by enhancing inflammatory
cytokine responses that, in turn, impair uteroplacental vascular function and perfusion. We will study a Bolivian
high-altitude (≥ 8,250 ft) population, where the incidence of PE is three-fold greater than at sea level. Aim 1 will
establish whether rs230511 is associated with impaired spiral artery remodeling, elevated circulating
inflammatory cytokine levels, lower uteroplacental perfusion, and reduced fetal growth. Using DNA isolated from
400 Andean maternal-infant pairs residing in La Paz, Bolivia, we will (1) determine maternal and infant rs230511
genotypes; (2) quantify the extent of spiral artery remodeling, (3) determine maternal and umbilical venous
inflammatory cytokine levels, uteroplacental blood flow and fetal growth; and (4) contrast these primary variables
by rs230511 status in maternal-infant pairs. To account for the effects of admixture, we will estimate individual
admixture using genotype data obtained by the Illumina Multi-Ethnic Genotyping Array. Aim 2 will determine
whether rs230511 disrupts inflammatory responses in human vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). We will use
the CRISPR-Cas9 system to create a targeted rs230511 conversion (C→T) in HUVECs and measure the effects
on transcriptional responses of NF-κB target gene networks to TNFα exposure by RNASeq, and inflammatory
cytokine secretion using a high-sensitivity multiplex assay. Our findings will be applicable for identifying novel
pathways to improve reproductive outcomes in other populations given that hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
are HA are equivalent to those at LA in terms of risk factors, physiological manifestations and consequences for
mother and child, and the genetic variant of interest is not confined to HA populations. By advancing the
understanding of maternal and fetal genetics for the regulation of inflammatory responses during pregnancy and
PE, our project will help guide future mechanistic studies, aid the development of preventive strategies to improve
reproductive outcomes and identify women at an increased risk of PE."
10814277,"Project Summary / Abstract
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder. Pathological changes in the brain can
be observed at least 15 years before clinical symptoms (preclinical stage). An early and accurate diagnosis tool
could save $7.9 trillion in medical and care costs. Moreover, an effective therapeutic strategy could improve the
clinical outcome if delivered early. There is a clear need to develop cost-effective and non-invasive biomarkers
for AD that can be used to identify individuals before symptoms emerge and patients at early-symptomatic stages
of disease. These novel biomarkers could be also leveraged to monitor disease progression and responses to
therapies. Cell-free nucleic acids diagnostic tests have revolutionized prenatal screening, and cancer research,
diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, specific transcripts ascertained from cell-free RNA have been evaluated
as biomarkers for AD, but so far, no high throughput approach has been attempted. The goal of this proposal is
to use high throughput sequencing of cell-free nucleic acids from plasma to construct a prediction model for
neurodegenerative diseases. I hypothesize that there are detectable changes in plasma cell-free nucleic acids
that are related to AD. During the K99 phase, I aim to predict accurately AD cases using cell-free nucleic acid
and bioinformatics tools, including machine learning. Briefly, I will sequence cell-free RNA present in longitudinal
samples of plasma from AD cases and controls, then build a predictive model. I will replicate this model in an
independent dataset of preclinical samples. I will include samples from mutation carriers and non-European
ancestry to validate the model. I will also determine if the model can predict other neurodegenerative diseases
or if it is specific to AD by quantifying plasma transcripts from patients with other neurodegenerative diseases.
My preliminary data show that this approach is feasible. I designed a preliminary predictive model with 10 AD
cases and 10 controls that has an area under the ROC curve of 1; then I replicated it in independent samples
(n=20) with an area under the ROC curve of 0.84. In four preclinical samples the ROC was 0.86 suggesting that
my model can also identify pre-symptomatic individuals. It is possible to improve this model by using more
powerful informatics approaches. Using deep neural networks, I obtained a ROC of 1 in the discovery dataset
and 0.94 in the replication dataset. During the R00 phase, I plan to use the same approach on other
neurodegenerative diseases to design specific predictive models. I will generate sequence data on the RNA
present in longitudinal plasma samples of cases and controls from Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy
bodies to construct specific predictive models for each of them. Then I will replicate the models in preclinical
samples of these diseases. Combining the information on all neurodegenerative diseases will also allow me to
refine the predictive model and perform integrative analyses to describe mechanistic insights. My ultimate goal
is to be able to use the predictive models as diagnostic tools, and if possible, as early diagnostic tests. The
preliminary data is encouraging and opens the possibility of having plasma-based tests for neurodegeneration."
10814139,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Much work in decision neuroscience has been predicated on the hypothesis that dopaminergic signaling plays
a critical role in value representations and their updating, and recent work has linked abnormalities in such
value representations to specific features of psychiatric illness (e.g., anhedonia in major depression). However,
despite the fundamental role that risk plays in evaluating choice options as well as the role sensitivity to risk
plays in psychiatric illness, including anxiety disorders at one extreme and health risk behaviors like substance
use at another other, an understanding of the neurobiology of risk remains elusive. Indirect evidence from
pharmacological studies have suggested both serotoninergic and noradrengergic signaling may play roles in
representations of risk; however, direct measurement of serotonin or norepinephrine signaling during risky
choice has yet to be examined in humans.
Recent advances by MPI Montague’s group allow the unprecedented ability to track neuromodulator
responses with high temporal resolution and chemical specificity. Specifically, MPI Montague’s team is able to
directly and simultaneously measure dopamine and serotonin responses in awake humans with the temporal
resolution (~ 1 ms) required to examine the relationship of neuromodulator release with decision-making
processes. For signal identification and extraction, the recording method uses machine-learning algorithms
(elastic net regression) combined with electrochemistry using only off-the shelf hardware and software. The
product of this ‘elastic net electrochemistry’ is recordings of in vivo neuromodulator fluctuations at sub-second
resolution. This application merges the decision neuroscience expertise of MPI King-Casas with these
advances of MPI Montague to directly examine serotonergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic functioning
during risky choice.
To achieve this goal, we will record neuromodulator responses in participants with medication-resistant
epilepsy who already have intracranial depth electrodes in place for phase-II monitoring. Depth electrodes will
be implanted by our neurosurgery colleagues at Virginia Tech’s medical affiliate Carilion Clinic (Carilion Clinic
PI: Witcher). During recording, participants will perform i) a risk elicitation task (Holt & Laury type task) and ii) a
reward learning task (multi-arm bandit task) that have been shown by our group and others both to reliably
evoke neural responses associated with risk and representations as they are monitored in a standard (i.e.,
non-surgical) hospital suite. Depth recordings will be made using a standard montage that includes multiple
contacts along the dorsal-rostral axis of the medial prefrontal cortex."
10814140,"Hemorrhagic stroke constitutes only 10-15% of total stroke types but is responsible for higher mortality
rates and survivors suffer from severe disabilities and post-stroke cognitive impairments (PSCI). Except
for surgical intervention, there is no effective treatment for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In order to
develop effective treatment modalities, it is imperative to gain a better understanding of the pathways
that are active after ICH, in particular, during secondary injury involving microglial activation mediated
neuroinflammation and PSCI. Microglia play an important role responding to injuries in the brain and a
comprehensive understanding of the microglia-specific signaling during episodes of injury are pivotal for
mitigating the damage induced by ICH. The three cofilin isoforms: actin binding protein, cofilin1 (cofilin)
and cofilin2 are important regulators of F-actin turnover and reorganization and alterations in these
processes can lead to neurodegenerative diseases. Cofilin rods/aggregates formed during pathological
conditions play a crucial role in microglial activation, synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. As a
mechanistic proof of concept, targeting cofilin with siRNA or inhibitor in mice led to decreased
hematoma volume, improved neurobehavioral functions and PSCI after experimental ICH.
Immunofluorescence analysis of human autopsy ICH brain specimens also showed widespread cofilin
activation in microglia in the perihematoma area. The novel findings support the scientific premise that
cofilin signaling plays a key role in the secondary phase of ICH involving microglial activation and
inflammation and subsequent PSCI and led us to hypothesize that inhibition of cofilin presents a novel
therapeutic strategy. The proposed hypothesis will be addressed in three aims. Aim 1 will identify cofilin
rods/aggregates and microglial activation in human ICH autopsy brain specimens by performing
immunofluorescence. The spatiotemporal pattern of cofilin rods/aggregates and PSCI will be determined
in wildtype (WT) mice over a protracted period of 60 days following ICH. Aim 2 will identify whether
microglial or neuronal cofilin is mediating neuroinflammation and PSCI after ICH by using neuron and
microglia-specific cofilin knockout mice. Aim 3 will study the therapeutic potential of a novel first of its
class, cofilin inhibitor in aged WT mice subjected to ICH. The studies outlined in this proposal will
provide insights on the role of cofilin signaling in ICH induced-microglial activation, inflammation and
PSCI and the identification of potential therapeutic agents for drug discovery and development."
10814241,"A major goal of this laboratory is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which TFs and epigenomic
modification control gene expression programs that regulate adipose tissue development and function.
Adipogenesis begins with an established cascade of transcription factor (TF) activity that includes collaboration
between the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (CEBPβ) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). A key goal of
the present proposal is to determine how CEBPβ and its related paralogs bridge the transcriptional programs in
multipotent stem cells and early differentiating pre-adipocytes, with a long-term objective of understanding a
comprehensive TF network promoting adipose tissue development, growth and function. Specific Aim 1
comprehensively identifies the components of active enhancers during human adipogenesis. We will
perform a state-of-the-art genomic/proteomic approach to determine the chromatin-associated proteins
promoting adipocyte differentiation. Specific Aim 2 elucidates the mechanistic actions of networked TFs
and co-regulators that control human adipogenesis and adipocyte function. Novel adipogenic roles for
protein candidates identified in Aims 1 will be examined by mutational analysis and genome-wide approaches.
As a whole, we will generate and integrate unique, orthogonal cistromic and enhancer proteomic datasets to
reveal fundamental molecular mechanisms for transcriptional regulators in native chromatin. This will elucidate
how CEBP proteins and GR perform unique biological functions, and address the more general question of
how TFs recognize, access and act at their genomic-binding sites to control tissue-specific gene expression.
Specific Aim 3 comprehensively identifies the components of active enhancers in adipose tissue. We
hypothesize that comparison of the enhancer proteomes from visceral and subcutaneous white adipose
tissues and from brown adipose tissue will reveal fundamental mechanisms controlling depot-specific gene
expression and uncover the set of transcriptional regulators controlling lipid metabolism in vivo. Our focus on
the development and function of adipose tissue is warranted given its importance in health and disease.
Indeed, adipose tissue normally benefits health, yet in excess as in obesity, it becomes a strong risk for
metabolic diseases including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and heart disease. New insights into
adipose biology will enhance its translational potential to combat the harmful and growing epidemics of obesity
and diabetes."

Dr. Alex Kula, MD, MHS, is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Pediatrics at Northwestern University
Feinberg School of Medicine (NU) and attending physician in the Division of Pediatric Nephrology at the Ann
and Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago (LCH). The K23 award will help Dr. Kula become an
independent physician-scientist who applies patient-oriented research (POR) methods to advance our
understanding and treatment of subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD) in youth with chronic kidney disease
(CKD). Evidence of subclinical CVD is present in youth with CKD, and risk for CVD is carried and compounded
into adulthood. Adults with CKD are at notably high risk for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
Transition from subclinical diastolic dysfunction to symptomatic HFpEF may be prevented with medications,
including sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). Yet, advanced echocardiographic parameters
used to identify diastolic dysfunction in adults have not been studied in pediatric CKD. The objective of this
proposal is to leverage insights developed in adults with CKD to define a phenotype of subclinical diastolic
dysfunction in pediatric CKD and to begin to test the reversibility of this phenotype in an interventional study. Dr.
Kula will pursue this objective through 2 complementary POR aims: 1) an in-depth physiologic study of diastolic
function at rest and with exercise using echocardiography in youth with stage 3-4 CKD (n=50) and age- and sex-
matched healthy controls (n= 25); 2) a feasibility study of SGLT2i in youth with stages 3-4 CKD (n=40) that will
assess primary end-points of feasibility and secondary end-points of SGLT2i effect on intermediate measures
associated with risk of HFpEF. The results will impact our understanding of subclinical CVD in youth with CKD
and serve as preliminary data for future R01 proposals. To ensure his transition to scientific independence, Dr.
Kula has designed a robust career development plan, with the following goals: 1) gain expertise in conducting
POR studies; 2) learn about cardiovascular phenotyping using echocardiography; 3) develop proficiency in
clinical trials; 4) strengthen cross-disciplinary collaborations, enrich research portfolio and master scientific
management skills. Dr. Kula’s scientific and training goals will be overseen by a multi-disciplinary and
experienced mentorship team. His primary mentor, Dr. Tamara Isakova, is a leader in POR methods and clinical
trials in nephrology. His co-mentor, Dr. Sanjiv Shah, has expertise in clinical phenotyping of diastolic dysfunction
and HFpEF. External advisory committee members will provide expertise in pediatric POR, cardiac phenotyping
in youth (Dr. Luc Mertens), and studies of CVD in pediatric CKD (Dr. Rulan Parekh). Dr. Kula will benefit from
the exceptional institutional environment of LCH and NU, including: 1) high-volume of youth with CKD seen in
LCH nephrology clinic; 2) research infrastructure of the Stanley Manne Children’s Research Institute at LCH;
3)robust and collaborative academic environment within LCH and NU. Upon completing the K23, Dr. Kula will
be uniquely positioned to study interventions for CVD risk reduction in a high-risk, but understudied, population."
10785765,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system
afflicting around one million people in the United States. The disease often presents with a relapsing-remitting
phase followed by gradual conversion to secondary progressive MS (SPMS) characterized by irreversible
accrual of disability and unresponsiveness to current disease-modifying therapies for MS. Age carries the
highest risk for developing SPMS, yet the underlying cellular, molecular, and genetic processes contributing to
biological aging are understudied in MS. Recent progress in aging research have led to the emergence of
geroscience as an interdisciplinary approach that seeks to reduce the incidence and severity of chronic age-
related diseases by understanding aging physiology and developing clinical interventions targeting aging
mechanisms. However, no studies to date have investigated the role of biological aging in MS using
established markers of cellular senescence (p16INK4a) and epigenetic aging (age-associated DNA methylation
patterns, or epigenetic clocks). The Trans-NIH Geroscience Interest Group recently emphasized a need to
engage researchers and clinicians across multidisciplinary specialties to translate geroscience discoveries into
effective clinical practices. Through the completion of this career development award, Dr. Zhang will become
one of few clinician scientists in the country whose research combines principles of geroscience with
neurology. This proposed study will investigate the associations of biological aging with clinical outcomes (aim
1), neuroimaging findings (aim 2), and immune dysregulation (aim 3) in people with MS. The study will consist
of a cross-sectional analysis of baseline associations of biological aging with MS outcomes and a 2-year
longitudinal analysis of the rate of biological aging with changes in MS outcomes. Dr. Zhang has assembled a
multidisciplinary mentorship team to achieve his career development goals of establishing a geroscience
framework to study MS by integrating clinical, neuroimaging, and molecular mechanistic studies. The
successful completion of this project will enable future studies to 1) use biological aging as a prognostic
biomarker in MS to employ early aggressive treatment in individuals with accelerated biological aging and 2)
conduct trials of anti-aging therapies in combination with MS disease-modifying therapies to mitigate or even
prevent MS progression."
10916512,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Unnecessary tests and treatments represent two of the greatest sources of preventable patient harm and
excess healthcare spending in the United States. Robust evidence demonstrates routine preoperative tests
such as electrocardiograms, blood and urine tests, and chest radiographs before low-risk surgery do not
prevent adverse events or improve outcomes. In addition, unnecessary preoperative testing can trigger care
cascades leading to additional specialty consultations and invasive procedures, potentially resulting in
significant patient harm, delays in surgery, and patient financial toxicity. Numerous professional societies
recommend against routine preoperative testing prior to low-risk surgery but eliminating use has proven
difficult. In the US, few investigators have moved beyond describing the prevalence of low value testing or
testing limited strategies targeting a single procedure (i.e., cataract surgery) or hospital. As a result, there are
no broadly scalable de-implementation strategies and unnecessary, wasteful, and harmful testing remains
commonplace. This research will test a theory-informed and broadly scalable multi-level, multi-component de-
implementation strategy to reduce unnecessary preoperative testing before low-risk surgery across diverse
procedures and practice types. In the Michigan Value Collaborative (MVC), a consortium of 87 Michigan
hospitals, routine preoperative testing occurs before low-risk surgery in more than 52% of patients with inter-
facility variation ranging from 8% to 85%. Our preliminary data has identified important, yet modifiable
determinants of unnecessary testing. Based on these findings, we will test a multi-level, multi-component de-
implementation strategy across Michigan hospitals. Using facilities jointly participating in the Michigan Surgical
Quality Collaborative (MSQC), the largest surgical collaborative quality improvement program in the United
States, we will evaluate the effectiveness of our intervention through a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial."

 This proposal is in response to PAR-21-138: Method to Extend Research in Time (MERIT) Award
Extension Request, which includes a 2-year MERIT extension request to support new data collection focused
on cannabis-tobacco co-use and the implications of cannabis use on tobacco cessation outcomes. This MERIT
proposal represents a timely and logical extension of the NCI-funded parent MERIT award (R37 CA237245, PI
McClure) entitled, “Determining the impact of cannabis use and severity on tobacco cessation outcomes: A
prospective tobacco treatment trial.” The overall goal of the funded parent R37 MERIT award was to conduct a
prospective tobacco treatment study evaluating the impact of cannabis co-use on tobacco cessation outcomes,
focused specifically on those smoking cigarettes. In the parent study, participants who co-use cigarettes and
cannabis are being oversampled 2:1 to cigarette-only participants. The parent study is designed to evaluate how
cannabis use may serve as a barrier to successful tobacco cessation and how cannabis use changes during a
tobacco cessation attempt. Several important observations have emerged during the course of the parent award
as well as in the tobacco-cannabis co-use literature more broadly, prompting the proposed 2-year MERIT
extension. Specifically, the use of e-cigarettes (vaped nicotine products; electronic nicotine delivery systems
[ENDS]) has increased among youth and adults in the United States (US). These trends in non-combustible
forms of tobacco use have been observed in the parent R37 award. Within the parent study, we are excluding a
large number of interested callers due to their use of e-cigarettes primarily or in combination with cigarettes at a
frequency that is exclusionary. While the parent study is focused on combustible tobacco use (cigarette
smoking), which is the most harmful of tobacco products, the ubiquity of e-cigarettes cannot be ignored,
particularly as it relates to cessation and the underlying relationship with cannabis co-use. Therefore, this 2-year
MERIT extension proposes to enroll a third group of adults (ages 18-40; N=70) who are using e-cigarettes daily
or near daily (co-use of cigarettes is allowable; <10 days out of the past 30) and are also using cannabis. We
will leverage the methods, measures, and procedures being used as part of the parent R37 to complete this e-
cigarette cessation trial with a focus on a co-use population to extend the generalizability of study findings. The
sample of e-cigarette-cannabis co-use participants is the main difference in this MERIT extension. This 2-year
MERIT extension will allow for the exploration of e-cigarette and cannabis co-use characteristics and the impact
of cannabis co-use on e-cigarette cessation. New data collection proposed here falls within the scope of the
parent grant and represents an important extension of the original aims. The inclusion of those using tobacco
through both cigarettes and e-cigarettes will allow for the evaluation of cannabis co-use on tobacco/nicotine
cessation and changes in the relationship between substances during a quit attempt."
10799227,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The role of synchronized oscillations and changes in coherence and connectivity within the basal ganglia
thalamocortical (BGTC) network in the development of motor signs in Parkinson’s disease (PD) remain under
debate. While deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been an effective therapy for many PD patients, the
mechanism(s) that underlie its therapeutic effect or how these compare to those that result from administration
of L-dopa are not known. To advance DBS therapy we must improve our knowledge of the pathophysiological
changes that underlie the development of PD and how DBS and L-dopa therapies that improve motor signs
affect synchronized oscillations and connectivity in the “broader” BGTC (bBGTC) circuit (STN, GPi, motor
thalamus, motor cortex (MC), supplementary motor area (SMA), premotor and prefrontal cortices (PMC and
DLPFC respectively)). To address these questions, we will record neuronal and local field potential (LFP)
activity simultaneously from 4 cortical (MC, PMC, SMA and DLPFC) and 3 subcortical sites (STN, GPi, and
motor thalamus) in the nonhuman primate MPTP (1methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) model of
parkinsonism. We will test the hypothesis that synchronized oscillations form across cortical and subcortical
structures, alter the timing of synchronization and desynchronization of neuronal populations in specific
frequency bands during movement and change connectivity patterns found in the normal state. We will
characterize the relative change in synchronized coupling and connectivity in the bBGTC network and
parkinsonian motor signs during DBS (STN, GPi, and STN + GPi) and compare that to the effect of L-dopa,
and L-dopa + DBS (SA1). We will use directional leads to define the relative change in synchronized coupling
and connectivity in the bBGTC network on parkinsonian motor signs and the degree of activation of motor,
associative and limbic circuits during dDBS that steers current into motor versus associative regions of the
STN and GPi (SA2). We will also determine the effect of a closed loop DBS approach on bBGTC connectivity
and motor signs where stimulation is time locked to specific phases of the oscillatory biomarker determined
through each animal’s resonant oscillatory frequency, i.e., phase-locked DBS (plDBS) (SA3). This study will
provide a greater understanding of the pathophysiological changes that occur in bBGTC circuitry in PD, further
delineate the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS and L-dopa, and characterize the relative
effect of dDBS and a novel closed loop DBS approach on network connectivity and motor signs. These data
will provide the rationale upon which current DBS therapies can be improved and future DBS therapies
developed not only for PD but for other neurological and psychiatric disorders."

The research proposed for this award offers an outstanding opportunity to meet my career goals of: (1)
becoming a leading mentor in geriatrics and palliative care; and (2) to pursue a new direction of research that
addresses meaningful activities for older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. My currently-
supported research includes two R01 awards focused on developing better prognostic models for older adults
in general and older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. A central theme of both R01
awards is that older adults care about more than survival, they care about their risk for developing disability
and losing their independence. Thus, our prognostic models will be designed to estimate time to death, time to
disability, time to difficulty with cognitively demanding daily tasks, and time to nursing home admission. My
proposed research leverages these data and intellectual resources for a new research direction, which will
explore the relationship between Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias and activities that are important to
older adults. This work is an extension of our central theme of focusing on outcomes that matter to older adults
other than survival. Older adults care not just about survival and independence in self-care activities, a rather
narrow view of the human experience, they care about being able to participate in activities that give their lives
meaning and value. Meaningful activities might include attending religious services, reading books, spending
time with family, or gardening. Little is known, however, about the relationship between participation in
meaningful activities and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. A central premise for this project is that
maintaining participation in meaningful activities is essential to quality of life for older adults with Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias. We will use the NHATS-Medicare linked datasets for this research, datasets
we already own and use. These datasets will serve as a rich laboratory for a variety of mentored projects. The
specific aims of the project are as follows: (1) To ascertain medical and social factors associated with
maintaining participation in meaningful activities for older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias; and (2) To determine the association between participation in meaningful activities and health
outcomes: quality of life, mortality, and healthcare costs over time for older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias. To accomplish my career goal of becoming a leading mentor in geriatrics and palliative
care, my career development objectives during this award are: (1) to accelerate collaboration with palliative
care; (2) to recruit mentees from diverse backgrounds; and (3) to engage in professional leadership
development."
10815847,"SUMMARY
Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, with salt sensitive hypertension (SSH)
accounting for 51% of all cases. As augmented sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) and dysregulated
neuroendocrine secretion are known to play critical roles in the development of SSH, w e propose a study
to investigate the mechanisms whereby hyperactivity of the brain orexin system, may critically influence SNA
and neuroendocrine dysregulation, thus contributing to SSH development.
Orexin A (OXA) is a multifunctional neuropeptide produced by hypothalamic neurons that plays various
physiological roles, including cardiovascular function, through binding with its receptors. Recent studies show
that upregulation of brain orexin signaling occurs in several animal models of hypertension suggesting
implications for overactive brain orexin signaling in hypertension development. However, the impact of orexin
system in the development of SSH and detailed molecular mechanisms underlying orexin system mediated
hypertension development are poorly understood. Our preliminary data shows that a high salt (HS) diet results
in hypertension, and significantly increases expression of OXA and orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) in the
hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of Dahl salt sensitive (Dahl S) rats, an animal model for human
SSH, but not in salt resistant rats. Interestingly, HS diet intake in Dahl S rats also increases OX1R expression
in adrenal glands, a component of hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) axis which is a central neuroendocrine
response system to combat stress and regulate multiple physiological functions. The PVN controls SNA outflow
and neuroendocrine hormone, such as vasopressin (AVP) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH),
production. Central administration of OXA increases SNA outflow and PVN AVP expression as well as plasma
corticosterone levels, a hallmark of HPA axis activation. Hyperactivity of HPA axis is involved in multiple
diseases including hypertension. Lesions in the PVN prevent high salt induced hypertension in Dahl S rats.
This body of evidence suggests that PVN OX1R activation is involved in SNA and HPA axis regulation, and
increased PVN OXA-OX1R signaling induced by high salt intake may stimulate neuroendocrine systemic
secretion, trigger long-term adaptive changes through regulating downstream gene expression, producing
excessive excitatory neurochemicals, resulting in augmented PVN sympathetic tone, and leading to SSH. The
objectives of this project are: (i) investigate whether chronic knockdown of PVN OX1R expression decreases
plasma corticosterone levels, attenuate HS induced increase in SNA, and prevent SSH; (ii) elucidate the
molecular mechanism underlying the relationship between OXA-OX1R and its augmentation of SNA and
dysregulation of HPA axis. A combination of in vivo gene transduction, electrophysiological recordings, and
molecular and biochemical approaches will be employed to answer our questions using salt sensitive and
normotensive rat models. Our studies may identify new targets for therapeutic intervention in hypertension."
10815849,"Project Summary/Abstract
‘Financial toxicity’ is a well-documented side effect of cancer diagnosis that encompasses a range of material,
psychological, and behavioral hardships such as debt, bankruptcy, financial worry, and treatment non-
adherence. Studies suggest that all patients, regardless of insurance type or socioeconomic status, are
vulnerable to adverse financial consequences following cancer diagnosis. Financial hardship can impact entire
families, most severely affecting spouse caregivers, whose assets, income, and expenses are often inextricably
linked with patients’. A number of studies have shown that, collectively, these financial hardships contribute to
disparities in patients’ quality of life and survival as well as caregivers’ well-being and ability to perform caregiving
duties. Accordingly, interventions to mitigate financial toxicity should address the shared financial concerns of
cancer patients and their spouses. Given the pressing need for such interventions in the context of rising
healthcare costs, we developed a financial navigation intervention in collaboration with: 1) Consumer Education
and Training Services (CENTS), a Seattle-based financial education and counseling organization; and 2) Patient
Advocate Foundation (PAF), a national patient navigation organization. Based on our preliminary work
demonstrating feasibility of delivering this intervention in the oncology clinic setting, we propose a prospective,
randomized pragmatic trial in which 536 cancer patient - spouse caregiver dyads will receive proactive financial
navigation or usual care. The intervention will consist of a one-time financial literacy education video, monthly
contact for six months with CENTS counselors and PAF case managers who will help the couple with the
financial aspects of cancer care, including budget management, insurance enrollment and optimization, access
to copay assistance and other resources to manage medical and non-medical out-of-pocket costs. Usual care
will also receive the one-time financial literacy video in order to standardize their experience. Our goals are to:
1) Determine the impact of a remotely-administered financial navigation program on development of material
household financial hardship, 2) Investigate whether proactive financial navigation improves patient and
caregiver psychosocial and healthcare utilization outcomes, and 3) Describe the use of financial navigation
services by financially fragile, lower income, younger, and minority race households and evaluate the
intervention’s effect in these subgroups. We will assess outcomes using survey, credit report, and medical record
data obtained at baseline, six months, and twelve months post-enrollment. The primary endpoint of this study is
incidence of household financial hardship within one year of enrollment. We expect that the results of this study
will show that proactive financial navigation improves financial, psychosocial, and clinical outcomes in cancer
patients and their spouse caregivers and should therefore be an essential component of high-quality cancer care
in the United States."
10815851,"Nonmedical (recreational) cannabis use is now legal in many states. Additional states are considering
legalization, despite the weakness of the current evidence base regarding potential impacts on public health.
This R01 proposal seeks 5 years of funding to understand: Aim 1) changes in cannabis use across the first
decade following cannabis legalization; Aim 2) changes in alcohol use, nicotine use, and their co-use with
cannabis following cannabis legalization; and Aim 3) whether psychosocial consequences of cannabis use
change in a legal cannabis context. This knowledge is critical to inform policy, support efforts to maintain hard-
won reductions in teen cannabis use since the 2000s, and promote responsible use by adults. The proposed
project is grounded in life course theories of development and substance use, and uniquely suited to address
stated goals. It continues and expands upon the Seattle Social Development Project-The Intergenerational
Project (SSDP-TIP), which aims to understand the impact of cannabis legalization on youth and parent
cannabis and other drug use (n = 426 families, 80% living in Washington State). SSDP-TIP includes a parent
drawn from another ongoing longitudinal panel study that began in 1985, their oldest biological child, and a
second caregiver (usually the spouse) when available. Seven waves of pre-legalization data (2002-2011; mean
child age in 2011 = 12) and three waves of short-term post-legalization data (2015-2017; mean child age in
2017 = 18) from offspring and parents are available. The proposed study will add three additional annual data
collections post-legalization in 2022, 2023, and 2024 with parents and offspring (mean offspring age in 2024 =
25; range: 11-36 years). For adolescent offspring, the accelerated longitudinal design allows us to compare
offspring measured before legalization to offspring from later birth cohorts measured at the same ages, but
after legalization. This permits the disentangling of child age and policy effects, and facilitates understanding of
the implications of cannabis legalization for prevention in ways that other studies cannot. The inclusion of
young adult offspring allows examination of the impact of cannabis legalization on patterns of use and
consequences across the 20s and into the early 30s. The inclusion of parents permits examination of post-
legalization changes in cannabis and other drug use and consequences across the 40s. SSDP-TIP is the only
study in Washington State with longitudinal data from youth and their parents beginning 10 years before
legalization. With the proposed data collections, it will also stretch to 12 years post-legalization. This
prospective, longitudinal design provides important advantages over large, repeated cross sectional studies by
enabling causal ordering of legalization and changes in behavior, disentanglement of change due to
legalization versus time or age, and study of both within- and between-person change. Findings will inform the
timing of efforts to prevent underage and problematic cannabis, tobacco, and alcohol use and help to clarify
public health impacts in the context of cannabis legalization."

The overall objective of this K24 application is to expand my current patient-oriented research (POR) and
mentoring to integrate patient engagement from research to dissemination of care to improve the biobehavioral
care of youth with chronic MSK pain. This award will provide the crucial protected time to enhance my quality
and quantity of mentoring of junior investigators focused on POR including current K awardees, future T-32
fellows, and clinical fellows (physician and psychology). My currently supported POR encompasses translating
targeted biopsychosocial assessments into mechanistically informed treatment approaches for optimal clinical
care, coupled with pain neuroscience psychology that leverages experimental and neuroimaging methods to
gain a mechanistic understanding of cognitive and affective processes that coalesce with function in children
with chronic pain and their parents. All projects leverage the ubiquity of digital health to enhance patient access
and reach. Our lab has world-leading expertise in theory- and mechanism-oriented research for patients and
their families. The new direction of research to be supported through this award focuses on gaining new expertise
in scientifically rigorous qualitative and codesign methods to partner with patients and their families across all
stages of research. This application proposes two studies with significant mentoring opportunities within my long-
term research objective to improve the health and well-being of youth with chronic pain. Study 1 characterizes
the lived experience of youth with musculoskeletal (MSK) pain seeking, completing, and reflecting on pain care.
Study 2 aims to codesign an optimization of our evidence-based graded exposure treatment for adolescents
with chronic MSK pain and their parents, GET Living. The K24 builds on my previous research, leverages existing
cohorts and data, adds new training, and solidifies collaborations with leaders in patient participatory research
and qualitative data analysis to provide effective mentorship to the next generation of POR pediatric pain
scientists. With support from the K24 award, I will enhance my mentoring capacity and I will work to enhance my
career development with activities relevant to my mentees, my research, and my professional development.
Specifically, I plan to deepen my understanding of qualitative data methods and analysis and patient participatory
research methods. Moreover, I will dedicate time to ensure continued training in legal and ethical issues
associated with research on human subjects and clinical trials and strengthen my professional leadership skills.
The proposed studies provide the ideal context for enhancing mentorship opportunities via hands-on training
and scientific development in the biobehavioral aspects of pediatric chronic pain applying patient-centered
methods. With dedicated time and training from the K24, I will be better equipped to mentor the next generation
of POR pediatric pain scientists and weave a patient-centered approach into all research from inception to
execution."
10815863,"Summary
Some of the most debilitating and harmful aspects of serious mental illnesses (SMI) are the 1) social isolation
(low numbers of social contacts) and 2) the subjective experiences of social disconnection (loneliness) that
frequently accompany these conditions. Social isolation and loneliness greatly impact day-to-day functioning and
are associated with poor cardiometabolic health and early mortality in SMI, and currently there are no available
treatments that can prevent or reverse these devastating consequences of having these illnesses. This may be
in part because the neural and psychological mechanisms underlying social isolation and loneliness in SMI, and
how they impact health outcomes, are poorly understood. However, recent clues from studies employing
advanced neuroimaging and digital assessments have formed the basis of a novel approach to investigating
such mechanisms, outlined in this proposal. Prior work has indicated that objective isolation and loneliness are
correlated but also somewhat independent. Recent neuroimaging findings support this model, revealing that
social isolation and loneliness have both shared and distinct neural correlates. However, it is also clear that these
are not static phenomena; smartphone-based assessments have revealed transient, dynamic changes in social
isolation and loneliness. Individual differences in the anticipation of rejection are associated with momentary
experiences of loneliness, greater avoidance and subsequent increases in social isolation. Thus, in the current
application, we propose to comprehensively measure both the relatively stable neural and behavioral predictors
of social isolation and loneliness, as well as the moment-to-moment changes in these experiences, in 60
individuals with SMI and 60 control subjects. In Aim 1 of the proposed project, we will show that the higher levels
of social isolation and loneliness in SMI are linked to shared and distinct neural responses to social stimuli, with
deficient responses of social perception-related circuitry (medial temporal lobe regions) linked to social isolation,
and deficient responses of reward-related circuitry (basal ganglia regions) linked to loneliness. In Aim 2, we will
measure transient changes in social isolation and loneliness with smartphone assessments using a longitudinal
“burst” design. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will determine how the quantitative markers of social isolation and loneliness
identified in Aims 1 and 2 predict indices of cardiometabolic health, measuring the stability of these associations
over time. Thus, in this project, we will show that fundamental neural and behavioral processes drive momentary
variation in the experience of social isolation and loneliness, and directly impact cardiometabolic health in SMI.
In follow-up work, these findings can be used as objective targets in studies of novel interventions which aim to
address these major causes of early mortality."

Abnormally aggregated tau protein is one of the main neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), and correlates with disease presentation and severity. The mechanism by which tau causes
neurodegeneration is unknown. Abnormal activation of the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response
(UPRER) has been implicated in AD and other tauopathies. The proposed project will leverage genetic
approaches in C. elegans to identify therapeutically tractable molecular mechanisms in the UPRER that
modulate tauopathy. The UPRER also becomes dysfunctional in aging, and tauopathies often coincide with
advanced age. Therefore, understanding the aberrant UPRER in the context of tauopathy is crucial for
neurodegeneration and aging research. Hypothesis: Abnormal UPRER activation promotes pathological tau
accumulation and facilitates synergistic toxicity with TDP-43.The proposed work will address two Specific
Aims: 1) Identify UPR-related genes enhancing tauopathy phenotypes by monitoring tau turnover, and 2)
Determine the role of UPR activation in TDP-43 cleavage and localization relative to tau.
 The research and training plan will be conducted in the Kraemer laboratory at the University of
Washington with the support of Drs. Brian Kraemer, Nicole Liachko, and Caitlin Latimer. The strong
neuroscience, neurology, and C. elegans research communities between the University of Washington, Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Puget Sound VA, and other institutions will provide resources, scientific
expertise, and clinical opportunities that support physician scientist training and enable the successful

Although purine nucleotide homeostasis is critical to photoreceptor health, basic aspects of purine metabo-
lism and its regulation in photoreceptors are unknown. Here, we analyze the critical role of inosine monophos-
phate dehydrogenase 1 (IMDPH1) in retinal function and disease. IMPDH1 catalyzes and regulates a critical
step in metabolic flow through the parallel de novo adenine and guanine nucleotide biosynthesis pathways. At
least a dozen dominant missense mutations in IMPDH1 cause photoreceptor degeneration. We will leverage the
recent advances we made with initial support from a two-year R21 award. We combined in vitro biochemical
analyses of the human and zebrafish retinal IMPDH1 variants with in situ characterization of mutant forms of
IMPDH1 in zebrafish, a well-established model for investigating the causes of photoreceptor degeneration. We
showed that the structural and biochemical properties of human retinal variants are conserved in zebrafish. Im-
portantly, our preliminary data also show that a transgenic zebrafish line expressing mutant IMPDH1 recapitu-
lates the retinal degeneration seen in human disease. We propose to exploit our extensive collection of
reagents and animal lines to define the structure, function, and metabolic role of IMPDH1 in healthy and dis-
eased photoreceptors. We use a multidisciplinary approach that combines characterization of IMPDH1 structure
and function using cryo-electron microscopy and biochemical dissection with cell biological and metabolic strat-
egies in intact retinas."
10822500,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is marked by impaired cognition and memory loss. AD patients also exhibit 5–10-fold
increased incidence of seizure activity compared to age-matched controls, with one study finding 42%
experienced subclinical epileptiform activity using extended EEG monitoring. Epileptiform activity predicts more
severe cognitive decline, and treatment with antiseizure drugs slows cognitive decline. Notably, there are
individuals who exhibit AD neuropathology on autopsy despite exhibiting normal cognition, referred to as non-
demented with AD neuropathology (NDAN). The mechanisms by which NDAN individuals maintain intact
cognition are unknown, although social interaction is associated with reduced risk of dementia in older adults.
Transgenic mice overexpressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein, which causes overproduction of Aβ
(APP mice, Line J20), also exhibit subclinical epileptiform and seizure activity, with a subset demonstrating
“resilience” similar to NDAN individuals. Around 30% of APP mice stop having seizure activity and develop
normal spatial memory by 3-4 months of age, despite having comparable levels of Aβ and seizure history to
“susceptible” APP littermates, who exhibit worsening memory and continued seizure activity. To stratify mice as
resilient or susceptible, we use ΔFosB expression in the dentate gyrus (DG) as a proxy, as we have previously
published ΔFosB as an excellent marker of chronic hyperexcitability, with the magnitude of ΔFosB expression
corresponding directly with both seizure frequency and spatial memory deficits. Resilient APP mice have ΔFosB
levels similar to NTG littermates, while susceptible APP mice express significantly more ΔFosB. To investigate
differences between resilient and susceptible APP mice, we examined an RNA-seq dataset generated using DG
samples from resilient and susceptible APP mice and NTG littermate controls. We identified 73 genes as
“resilience genes”, as differential expression was only observed in resilient mice relative to NTG and susceptible
mice. Of the resilience genes identified, I further examined oxytocin receptor (Oxtr), given its high AGORA score
(suggesting relevance to human AD) and oxytocin’s role in promoting social behaviors, as social isolation is a
risk factor for AD. Oxytocin has also been implicated in reducing seizure activity and improving spatial memory
in mouse models of epilepsy and AD, respectively. Preliminary data indicated that resilient APP mice exhibit
increased oxytocin signaling to the hippocampus. Notably, chronic oxytocin treatment in APP mice reduced
ΔFosB levels to near NTG levels, suggesting oxytocin may confer resilience to APP mice. To investigate the role
of oxytocin in resilience to AD progression, I will 1) characterize the natural time course of changes in oxytocin
signaling in resilient APP mice and investigate underlying mechanisms, and 2) determine necessity and
sufficiency of oxytocin signaling in conferring resilience to AD progression. By identifying underlying genetic
mechanisms conferring this natural resilience, we can target these pathways for exogenous manipulation in an
effort to artificially confer resilience to AD progression."

This current proposal is in response to NIDDK’s awareness and need for a more diverse workforce to achieve
its mission. Hence, early career investigators need the opportunity to gain research knowledge coupled with
quality mentorship to assist with the proper application of those skills, resulting in innovative and meaningful
research. In addition to providing mentorship on research skills, it is also important to understand the
circumstances, as mentioned in the second quote, in which early career investigators have found themselves
and work to develop needed soft (non-research) skills. In some cases, mentees may need to unlearn, learn, and
relearn certain behaviors and habits to be successful. Taken together, my philosophy as a mentor is to
provide experiences for early career investigators, especially from underrepresented groups, that will
help them develop into well-rounded individuals who contribute to advancing science as well as be
demonstrative of reputable citizens in academe. To achieve this goal, I am committed to the following specific
aims:
Aim 1: Continue to develop and hone mentoring skills that will equip me to meaningfully contribute to
the career development and advancement of underrepresented early-stage investigators. I will participate
in mentor focused trainings and workshops offered nationally as well as locally through the University of
Kentucky’s Center for Clinical and Translational Science (UK CCTS).
Aim 2: Use funded research to provide opportunities for mentees to gain hands-on experience in
community-based research, health inequities, and research addressing social determinants of health
that are aligned with NIDDK’s mission as well as develop soft skills necessary to navigate a research
career in academe. Funded research aligned with NIDDK’s mission will be utilized to provide teachable
moments in research design, responsible conduct of research, data management, team science, and
dissemination of research findings. During these interactions, I will work with mentees to identify and cultivate
soft skills that need development for future success.
Aim 3: Provide training and networking opportunities for mentees. I will utilize resources provided by this
grant to identify trainings and workshops that will assist mentees with developing research and leadership skills,
attend scientific meetings, and participate in networking events."

Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States where delays in diagnosis and treatment lead
to increased mortality and advanced-stage disease. Developing artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL)
approaches for the automatic characterization of malignant disease can facilitate the early detection, diagnosis,
prognosis, and treatment of cancer. Radiomics and DL approaches extract quantitative information and visual
features from radiological data to glean insights into a patient’s disease. Traditional radiomics approaches suffer
from reproducibility issues due to small dataset sizes and differences in imaging scanners, reconstruction
methods, and operator variability in regions of interest segmentation. DL methods require training on large
datasets with annotated ground truth, which is difficult to obtain due to the limited availability of physician-defined
annotations and histopathological ground truth. Radiomics and DL methods are often trained on datasets that
encompass a specific malignancy, which additionally limits their generalizability and overall utility. Nuclear
medicine imaging modalities provide important functional information regarding radiotracer uptake in benign and
malignant pathologies that can help inform diagnosis and treatment. There is a significant unmet need to develop
research and clinical tools that address the challenges of enabling large-scale AI-based pipelines in nuclear
medicine. Aim 1 will build a large database of clinical positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography
(CT) images with physician-annotated ground truth. Aim 2 will develop a physics-guided deep generative
modeling approach to generate realistic simulated PET/CT data with known ground truth. Aim 3 will quantify the
robustness of radiomic features using both simulated and clinical PET/CT data. Aim 4 will develop and validate
a simulation-based transfer learning approach on automated lesion detection, segmentation, and classification
tasks. Aim 5 will develop and validate a multipronged approach that combines robust radiomics, DL, and
ensemble meta-learning to predict clinical outcomes from PET/CT images of patients with cancer. In the K99
training phase of this grant, Dr. Kevin H. Leung will conduct the proposed research under the guidance of Dr.
Martin G. Pomper with the support of outstanding advisory committee members with extensive expertise in
radiology, oncology, PET, CT, and medical imaging physics. The major objective of the mentored research phase
is to create a large clinical PET/CT database encompassing a wide range of cancers and to develop a physics-
guided approach to generate realistic simulated PET/CT data that reflect clinical population-level characteristics.
The technology developed from the K99 phase will be expanded in the independent R00 phase into a generalized
platform that will enable large-scale AI in nuclear medicine for a wide range of medical image analysis tasks.
The rich resources and strong collaborations available at Johns Hopkins provide an ideal training environment
that is completely supportive of the proposed research and the academic advancement of Dr. Leung."
10817839,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Since the introduction of chemotherapy for the treatment of childhood leukemia more than 60 years ago, the
prognosis of childhood cancer has improved dramatically. The overall 5-year survival rate for childhood cancers,
many of which were uniformly fatal in the pre-chemotherapy era, is now 84%. Progress for a number of childhood
cancers, however, has been limited, with approximately 50% of children with acute myelogenous leukemia, 50%
of children with high-risk neuroblastoma, and more than 90% of children with brainstem glioma, still succumbing
to their disease. In the US, cancer remains the leading cause of death from disease in children greater than one
year of age. Moreover, the late effects of cancer treatment, including permanent organ and tissue damage,
hormonal and reproductive dysfunction and second cancers, are of special concern, with more than 40% of the
estimated 360,000 survivors of childhood cancer experiencing a significant health related quality of life
complication from childhood cancer and its treatment. Thus, despite our advances, development of new
therapeutic approaches must be a priority for childhood cancer basic, translational and clinical researchers. The
Children’s Oncology Group (COG), the world’s largest organization devoted exclusively to childhood and
adolescent cancer research, was founded 17 years ago. The COG’s multidisciplinary research team, comprised
of more than 9,000 members, conducts research at more than 220 leading children’s hospitals, universities, and
cancer centers. This proposal is for COG, as part of the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) National Clinical Trials
Network (NCTN), to continue its collaborative research work that supports the mission of improving the outcome
for all children with cancer. The COG will design and conduct clinical-translational studies for children with cancer
that builds on an increasing understanding of the molecular basis for pediatric malignancies and has the highest
potential to improve the outcome. Using innovative clinical trial designs suitable for the study of rare diseases,
we will study novel therapeutic approaches including but not limited to targeted small molecule drugs,
immunotherapies and cellular therapies. The COG research portfolio importantly also includes clinical trials
focused on improving the quality of life children with cancer and survivors. As more than 90% of children
diagnosed with cancer in the US are treated at COG member institutions, the COG has the ability to offer a
diverse population of children with cancer and their families the opportunity to participate in innovative research.
This research effort includes allowing for collection and annotation of biospecimens from all children with cancer,
providing the foundation for discovery and accelerating the most promising research efforts conducted in
laboratories around the world. The proposal is for support of the COG Network Statistics and Data Management
Center which collaborates with COG scientific leaders to design, conduct, analyze and report the results of
clinical-translational trials for the treatment of childhood cancers."
10934364,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A growing number of studies have demonstrated that oxytocin (OXT) provides an attenuating effect on cocaine
reward behaviors in rodents and therefore may be investigated as a potential modulator of cocaine reward
processes. Despite this, the specific mechanism through which OXT exerts this modulatory effect on cocaine-
related behaviors remains unclear. The present research project proposes that OXT attenuates cocaine-
associated preference via a two-fold mechanism on dopamine (DA) neurons within the ventral tegmental area
(VTA). Recent evidence suggests that OXT receptors (OXTRs) on VTA DA neurons both increase tonic firing of
the DA neuron and decreases excitatory inputs, likely affecting phasic activation of the DA neuron. This decrease
in excitatory inputs has been shown to be mediated by an OXT interaction with presynaptic CB1 receptors
(CB1Rs) on glutamatergic terminals. This project investigates the functional relevance of this effect using a novel
combination of transgenic rat and virally-delivered shRNA to silence VTA DA OXTRs or presynaptic
glutamatergic CB1Rs. First, OXTRs on DA VTA neurons will be silenced in male and female rats using a
transgenic Cre rat and Cre-dependent knockdown of OXTRs to determine the effect of OXT-mediated DA firing
rate. Behaviorally, OXT attenuates cocaine preference behaviors, and it is expected that silencing of OXTRs on
VTA DA neurons will diminish this effect. Second, to further elucidate the specific mechanism through which
OXT attenuates cocaine preference via VTA DA neurons, CB1Rs on VTA glutamatergic inputs will be silenced
using a combination of transgenic Cre rat and shRNA silencing of CB1R in the absence of Cre expression. OXT
is known to reduce neuronal excitation through production of endocannabinioids (eCB) that retrogradely reduce
presynaptic input via CB1 receptors. Through this, the effect of glutamatergic CB1R silencing will be assessed on
OXT-mediated VTA DA phasic neuronal firing. Behaviorally, this demonstrates that OXT-mediated reduction of
VTA DA phasic firing underlies OXT-mediated attenuation of cocaine-associated preference. Overall, this project
will utilize a novel combination of tools to investigate the specific neural mechanism through which OXT
attenuates cocaine reward and offer insight into the use of OXT as a therapeutic target for cocaine-related
disorders in males and females."
10811638,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Behaviors and mental functions are emergent properties of large-scale neuronal networks where connectivity
strengths between nodes define the network. Correspondingly, many neurological and psychiatric symptoms
arise from network-level imbalances where structural and/or functional connectivity between specific brain areas
has been altered (e.g., sub-cortical stroke, traumatic brain injury TBI). For structural injury, while the adult brain
has little capacity to re-grow damaged long-range axons, it may be possible to restore connectivity by training
the brain to use alternate routes reconnecting the areas and/or counteracting maladaptive connectivity changes,
with the goal of improving motor/behavioral/cognitive function. This also applies to disorders without structural
injury but with acquired pathological connectivity changes (e.g., addictions, depression). To restore the network
in a controlled fashion, there is a critical need to develop techniques that can selectively engage the targeted
connection and increase or reduce its effective connectivity strength. Moreover, the techniques should be appli-
cable to the human brain and ideally be non-invasive. To this aim, cortico-cortical paired associative stimulation
(ccPAS) protocols have been proposed, presumably engaging spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) mech-
anisms. However, progress in applying ccPAS in humans has been limited. This is because millisecond-precision
intracranial conduction delays, which are a prerequisite for choosing ccPAS parameters that would have the
desired effect, are not known. Further, neurophysiological outcome measures to capture intracranial ccPAS ef-
fects are lacking, which makes it difficult to assess if the stimulation achieved its goals – in fact, it has not even
been convincingly shown if ccPAS engages STDP. The overall goal of the proposal, therefore, is to overcome
these barriers by (a) crafting novel techniques that can measure the required fast intracranial conduction delays,
(b) developing outcome measures that capture ccPAS neurophysiological effects accurately, and (c) proving
ccPAS mechanisms. Specifically, inspired by previous animal and human studies, as well as our own preliminary
ccPAS data, we will stimulate two interconnected cortical regions with millisecond-level asynchronies with two
independent transcranial magnetic stimulator (TMS) coils. Our preliminary data show source-space cortico-cor-
tical evoked potentials (ccEP) that capture both the required conduction delays and serve as outcomes of ccPAS
effects at the physiologically relevant fast (<10 ms) timescales. Further, our preliminary data that parametrically
manipulates ccPAS asynchronies are in accord with that the mechanism is indeed STDP. If successful, this
study will transform our capability to non-invasively manipulate brain interregional effective connectivity in the
human brain, therefore laying the foundation for a new class of robust network-level therapies in disorders that
involve brain connectivity changes in a broad range of neurological and psychiatric disorders."
10811641,"In the current era of Precision Medicine, laboratory studies are an integral component of cancer clinical trials.
Amongst the most powerful techniques connecting therapies to specific patients are assays that interrogate
nucleic acids (DNAseq and/or RNAseq), which are now most typically done using massively parallel
sequencing (MPS). RNAseq now offers an extremely powerful approach for querying the tumor genome,
where gene expression profiles have proven value in providing prognostic information, predictive information,
and also critical information on the tumor microenvironment including quantitative measures of immune
infiltrations. In addition, DNA based approaches can also be clinically informative in detecting somatic
sequence alterations (mutations), structural variations (fusions), loss of normal DNA sequences (deletions), or
sequence gains (amplifications). Alternatively, sequencing assays can target DNA from noncancerous cells to
address additional questions including identification of familial predisposition, and genotyping of drug
metabolizing enzymes of therapeutic importance.
Through this Project, the UNC / UTHSC UNITS team will provide high volume clinical grade sequencing in a
regulatory compliant manner from day one of the grant. As a world leader in the production of human RNA-
based cancer data, from both frozen and FFPE, including RNA sequencing and targeted RNA quantification,
RNA-based assays are offered within a compliant setting. We are also highly experienced with common, and
complex, DNA-based assays and offer these as well. Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal involve providing an FDA-
and CAP- compliant mechanism for high sample throughput for RNA- and DNA-sequencing from samples
provided from multi-institutional cooperative group trials. RNA sequencing will be offered in 3 formats, RNA-
Seq, NanoString, and Q-rt-PCR, to allow both comprehensive coverage and inexpensive targeted RNA
profiling. DNA sequencing will be offered for both whole exome and targeted capture by MPS, as well as
quantitative DNA measures by NanoString. The third aim is to develop and provide data sharing formats and
an infrastructure for the proper dissemination of clinical trial sequence-based patient information, which is
needed is this era of Big Data."
10809442,"Project Summary/Abstract
Host transfer RNAs are cleaved into fragments during infection by diverse bacteria and viruses, yet what
triggers this molecular event and how tRNA fragments (tRFs) impact infection remain poorly understood. This
proposal leverages powerful molecular, genetic, and biochemical approaches during gammaherpesvirus
infection to profile differential tRNA cleavage and to assess how tRNA cleavage and/or the resulting tRFs
regulate the antiviral response. The overall objective in this proposal is to profile tRFs in infected primary cells
and define whether tRNA cleavage or tRFs modulate gammaherpesvirus infection. This work explores the
central hypothesis that tRNAs are cleaved in response to viral sensing and that gene regulatory functions of
tRFs further establish an antiviral state. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 employs a highly innovative sequencing
strategy to accurately sequence tRNAs and their derivatives induced by gammaherpesvirus infection in
primary, immune-competent cells. This aim will identify abundant, and likely functionally relevant, infection-
induced tRFs, as well as introduce a sequencing tool with broad applicability to the tRF field. Aim 2 tests the
hypothesis that tRF biogenesis is part of the host antiviral response by assessing gammaherpesvirus
replication in response to decreased or increased expression of tRFs or tRNA endonucleases. These
experiments will result in fundamental knowledge explaining why tRFs are generated in response to diverse
viruses and reveal broad potential for tRNA-based antiviral therapeutic strategies. The work proposed here is
significant, as it will pioneer the concept of antiviral tRFs, introduce a widely applicable sequencing strategy,
and will ultimately reveal novel tRNA-centric nodes of gene expression control that can be manipulated to
prevent and treat infectious disease."

Cause Lung Pathology?
Respiratory viruses such as SARS-CoV1, Influenza and recently SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) have caused the
major pandemics in the 21st century and influenza causes high levels of death from yearly circulating outbreaks.
T cells can target internal viral proteins, that mutate less frequently. Thus, T cell memory induced by previous
vaccination or infection can still be effective against emerging mutant viral strains. Tissue resident memory
(TRM) cells, that develop in the lung are at the first line of defense of our adaptive immune response against
respiratory infections because of their location. However, lung CD8 TRM, which are most- studied, are short-
lived. The few studies that have examined lung CD4 TRM suggest that they may decay less rapidly. We know
relatively little about lung CD4 TRM longevity and mechanisms of function, though they are known to protect
against many respiratory infections such Influenza, Sendai, B.pertussis, pneumococcal pneumonia and
tuberculosis infections. Moreover, we know little about the CD4 effectors that are precursors to the lung CD4
TRM. If CD4 lung TRM are longer-lived, they might compensate over the long-term for the rapid decline in CD8
lung TRM, thus making them good vaccine targets to provide strong more durable immunity.
A majority of the CD4 and CD8 T cells in human lung express TRM features, so it is vital to understand their
impact when they are reactivated during an immune response, both their positive effect on protection against
pathogens and negative effects on lung function and tissue damage. In many respiratory infections such as
influenza and COVID-19 there is also potential for severe lung damage leading to poor prognosis. We show that
cytotoxic CD4 T cells, that are resident effectors in the lung and that contribute to damage, can be precursors
oflung CD4 TRM. Thus, it is vital that we learn how CD4 TRM can both protect and cause lung pathology on
reactivation, especially if they are maintained long-term.
Here, we propose to identify the precursors of CD4 lung TRM from CD4 lung effectors, and better define their
protective and pathogenic potentials. We will phenotypically and molecularly characterize the CD4 TRM formed
from subsets of lung CD4 effectors. We will study their longevity and their maintenance via mechanisms such
as homeostatic proliferation and recruitment from circulation. Finally, we will study in detail their functional
mechanisms of eliciting protection vs those causing lung immunopathology by direct cytolysis, inflammation and
helper function. Understanding mechanisms/conditions driving protection and pathology by CD4 TRM will enable
design of interventions like vaccines and immunotherapies, that favor the development of protection while
minimizing pathology. Identifying precursor CD4 effectors that give rise to protective CD4 TRM will also allow us
to finetune vaccine approaches that drive generation of those CD4 effector subsets. In future studies, we will
use the knowledge gained here, to identify transcriptional networks that regulate the development of CD4 TRM
from CD4 effectors and naïve CD4."

autoimmune diseases, organ and cell allogeneic and xenogeneic transplantation models or immunization
procedures that use NHP models increasingly include the use of recombinant cytokines, chemokines, growth
factors or immunomodulatory ligands in vivo. While the close evolutionary relationship between human and
nonhuman primates generally provides cross reactivity between most human recombinant factors when used
with NHP cells, differences in affinity/bioactivity have been noted. More important however, most NHP molecules
are not identical to human homologues, often leading to the development of neutralizing antibody responses to
the xenogeneic molecule in vivo, markedly restricting the repeated and most optimal in vivo use of select
immunomodulators in these models. The ready availability of standardized purified recombinant NHP reagents
has largely alleviated this limitation and allowed investigators to address seminal questions using NHP during
the past 15 years of funding. Of note, while some commercial companies have started to produce a limited set
of NHP cytokines, the costs charged by these companies is generally well beyond the budget of most NIH
research awards, further validating the continuous need for this Resource. In addition, testing of in vivo
administration of these reagents has markedly revised the clinical administration schedule, leading to more
tolerable and efficacious dosing. Last but not least, we propose to leverage the strengths available at NIRC in
imaging NHP technologies, to generate novel antibody based ligands for imaging technologies that are
increasingly used in support of scientific explorations. Thus, this application requests continued support for
allowing this Resource to provide NHP factors, in DNA and protein form. Specifically, the resource will perform
the following: 1. Continuation and expansion of preparation, optimization, testing and distribution of NHP
cytokines/chemokines and soluble receptors in protein and recombinant DNA expression vectors. 2. Generation
and optimization of primate specific PET and fluorescent probes to be used in vivo and 3. Collaboration with the

10808684,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is estimated to affect 30 million U.S. adults and skeletal muscle (SkM) insulin resistance
(IR) is considered to be one of the primary aberrations. Effective insulin-stimulated SkM glucose uptake is
dependent on 1) insulin-stimulated activation of terminal arteriole endothelial cells (EC) to perfuse microvascular
units, 2) transport of substrates across capillary ECs and 3) stimulation of myofiber insulin signaling, resulting in
glucose uptake. Therefore, both myofibers and ECs are critical cell types that can be dysregulated with IR in
T2D. Previous research has identified a dysregulated transcriptional profile with SkM IR in the basal state and
during insulin stimulation from a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (HE). A significant limitation of these prior
studies is the restriction to whole SkM homogenates and therefore not identifying which cells or spatial area the
dysregulated signals originate from. We have developed a pipeline for 3’ and 5’ amplification of single cells or
nuclei from SkM using full-length SMART-Seq technology with the iCELL8 platform, resulting in 2-3 fold greater
gene coverage than previous research, allowing us to investigate transcriptional aberrations at a single cell/nuclei
resolution. Recent developments in spatial transcriptomics now permit transcriptional profiling on sectioned
tissue. In this proposed research, we will leverage both full-length single cell and single nuclei RNA-Seq and
spatial transcriptomics to determine cell- and spatially-distinct transcriptional aberrations in SkM that occur with
IR in T2D. The career development training will refine my skills in; leading an independent lab, bioinformatics,
and human clinical research with a focus on assessing insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (Rd) and non-
oxidative glucose disposal (NOGD) using hyperinsulinemic euglycemic (HE) clamps with glucose tracers and
indirect calorimetry. My K99/R00 training will uniquely position me to conduct bedside-to-bench-to-bioinformatics
research to uncover the molecular profiles of SkM IR. For the first time, the transcriptional responses to insulin
in human SkM will be probed at a single cell/nuclei and spatial resolution. We will identify which cells and areas
of SkM respond to insulin and if they are spatially localized to each other and if their gene-network profiles
correlate with a greater in vivo Rd and NOGD assessed simultaneously with a HE clamp. This novel and
innovative approach will reveal which cells (and importantly, where in SkM) the aberrations occur with IR in T2D.
The Translational Research Institute at AdventHealth is an ideal environment for developing my bedside-to-
bench-to-bioinformatics research approach with cutting-edge metabolic translational research facilities and a rich
interdisciplinary environment. Completion of the proposed research and career development training will facilitate
my success as an independent translational investigator in SkM metabolism and IR. Furthermore, experiments
in this proposal will identify specific molecular targets to alleviate SkM IR that will be targeted in future grant
applications."

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive lethal disease characterized by widespread obstruction
in the smallest arteries of the lungs. Pulmonary microvascular obstruction leads to increased pulmonary vascular
resistance, which subsequently causes right heart failure. Potential new targets for PAH therapy are lacking, yet
despite the existing need for disease-modifying therapeutics, the rational selection of targets is significantly
hampered by the still poor understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate PAH
pathogenesis. We have shown in multiple animal models of PAH that targeting the serotonin 2B receptor (5-
HT2B) genetically and pharmacologically prevents the development of disease. While 5-HT2B antagonism
shows tremendous promise for PAH therapy, currently embodiments penetrate the blood-brain barrier. 5-HT2B
mutation in the central nervous system is associated with several adverse consequences, such as depression,
aggression, impaired sleep, and suicidality that limit the clinical potential of this treatment. Therefore, to
overcome this limitation we have developed novel 5-HT2B antagonists that are both selective and potent, but
also systemically restricted such that they do not cross the blood-brain-barrier. Here, we propose to de-risk these

efficacy in preclinical models. At the conclusion of these aims, we hope to have identified a well-positioned,
disease-modifying PAH therapy that has completed IND-enabling studies."
10808480,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a major cause of healthcare-related mortality and a significant public
health burden in the US. C. difficile (Cd) remains a persistent cause of morbidity and mortality in healthcare
settings, in part because many patients are asymptomatic for CDI yet colonized with Cd. These patients
outnumber CDI patients, can transmit Cd and progress to CDI (especially in the context of antibiotic exposure).
Importantly, the clinical outcomes in Cd-colonized patients exists on a spectrum influenced both by the
microbial community and the virulence of the Cd strain. Critically, conventional animal models of CDI do not
recapitulate microbiome and pathogen variation seen in asymptomatically-colonized patients, thus requiring
the development of novel animal models to study this patient population. The long-term goal of this research is
to identify opportunities for novel therapeutic intervention or pathogen surveillance by better understanding and
predicting Cd-associated clinical outcomes. The objective of this proposal is to use clinically-relevant animal
models to 1) investigate the extent to which commensal microbiota protect the host from diverse Cd strains, 2)
predict microbiome vulnerabilities to antibiotic-induced CDI, and 3) identify microbiome features that synergize
with prebiotic administration. The central hypothesis of this work is that the composition of the commensal
microbiota plays a central role in determining host disease severity. The specific aims of this proposal are to: 1)
investigate the in vivo role of commensal Eubacteriaceae in microbiome-based protection against Cd infection
and 2) identify microbiome correlates of antibiotic-induced CDI and prebiotic synergy. The proposal will use
microbiome-humanized models of Cd colonization/infection that integrate both clinically-represented Cd strains
and patient-derived bacterial communities to understand the microbiota's impact on host inflammation,
community metabolism, and Cd proliferation. This research will spur the development of innovative treatment
and diagnostic approaches to mitigating CDI. Dr. Dantas will oversee the project, provide direct mentoring on
statistical modeling of multi-omics data, and help Dr. Fishbein's transition to independence through support of
networking strategies. Dr. Fishbein has prepared a Scholarly Advisory Committee along with other Significant
Contributors with expertise in host-pathogen interactions, gut microbiome-pathogen dynamics, and intestinal
inflammation. The training plan combines primary mentorship, committee interactions, formal coursework (at
the University and externally), and seminar/conference presentations to expand Dr. Fishbein's technical and
conceptual foundations in the microbiome field. This award will facilitate Dr. Fishbein's acquisition of
independent funding, enabling her transition to an independent research program at a research-intensive
academic institution."
10809203,"Abstract. Why 5-10% of people develop tuberculosis (TB) after Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is
largely unknown. Th1 immunity is the dominant mechanism of control. In contrast, how type 2 immunity affects
immunity to TB is a clinically important knowledge gap. Th2 immune responses are elicited by helminths
parasites, and half of the 180 million school age children in Sub-Saharan Africa are estimated to be infected
with helminths. Chronic helminth infection induces Th2 and Tregs, both which inhibit Th1 immunity, and impair
BCG efficacy. IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 are the canonical cytokines of Th2 cells. These cytokines are also produced
by innate cells including eosinophils and mast cells. We discovered that BCG vaccination worsens subsequent
Mtb infection in CC040 mice and is associated with the emergence of IL-4-producing cells in the lung. Our
overarching hypothesis is that IL-4 production in CC040 mice permits Mtb growth and exacerbates disease in
BCG vaccinated mice. While the mouse has been outstanding in developing immunological concepts that
translate into humans, standard inbred strains lack the genetic diversity of people. Th1 immunity develops
following Mtb infection in C57BL/6 (B6) mice, the “go to” strain for immunologists. However, B6 mice poorly
model other immune responses including Th2 and Th17 responses, and MAIT cells. To address the short-
comings of the murine TB model, we are using Collaborative Cross (CC) mice to study mechanisms of
vaccine-induced immunity against TB. CC mice are derived from eight founder strains that include wild-derived
mice. The breeding schemes captured >90% of the diversity present in the Mus species and led to the creation
of ~70 CC strains. In one of these, the CC040 strain, we detect a clinically relevant phenotype that is not
detected in traditional mouse models (i.e., B6). Using the CC040 mouse strain, we will ask how IL-4 affects
vaccine-induced protection against Mtb infection. We will determine which cell types produce IL-4 and whether
IL-4 is induced by BCG and/or Mtb infection. Next, we will measure how immunity is altered in an IL-4-sufficient
environment by performing scRNAseq of lung cells from IL-4-sufficient or depleted CC040 mice, following BCG
vaccination and Mtb infection. Two strategies will be used to determine how IL-4 affects vaccine-induced
protection against Mtb infection. Whether IL-4 is detrimental to BCG-mediated protection and heightens the
susceptibility of CC040 mice to TB will be tested by depletion of IL-4 or IL-4-producing cells. Another approach
will use genetic segregation and mapping analysis to determine the role of IL-4 signaling and identify genetic
susceptibility loci specifically driving IL-4-enhanced Mtb disease. New insights into how mast cells and
eosinophils affect TB susceptibility are changing the way we view immunity to mycobacteria. Clinical and
epidemiological data indicates that IL-4 production during chronic helminth infection could impair BCG efficacy
and immunity to TB. The CC040 strain will be an important tool to unravel how IL-4 and IL-4 producing cells
affect immunity to Mtb."

ABSTRACT
Detection of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) at or close to surgical margins increases the
risk of death at 5-years by 90%. However, large surgical margins to ensure clear margins can greatly increase
a patient's morbidity with functional and cosmetic damage of oral and facial structures. Although promising,
single fluorescence agents targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are qualitative at best, have
moderate tumor-to-normal tissue contrast, and have not yet demonstrated long-term improved patient
outcomes. Our recently developed in vivo paired-agent imaging method allows quantification of extracellular
receptor expression (and identification of cancerous tissue) by utilizing simultaneously delivered targeted and
non-targeted (i.e., perfusion) agents to reference the plasma delivery and leakage. The ability to eliminate the
non-binding fluorescence contribution in the tumor and surrounding normal tissues increases the observed
tumor-to-normal tissue contrast and improves our ability to observe microscopic tissue burden. The central
HYPOTHESIS is that EGFR targeted Paired-Agent Imaging for Resection During Surgery (PAIRS) will improve
HNSCC patient long-term survival and decrease morbidity. The ultimate RESEARCH GOAL is to demonstrate
that PAIRS outperforms both traditional (non-guided) and single, fluorescent-agent guided surgical resection in
detecting microscopic tumor in surgical margins of a spontaneous HNSCC patient-surrogate model.
Clinical translation of PAIRS will be fully realized by completion of the outlined SPECIFIC AIMS:
Aim 1 - Develop clinic-ready integrated FGS system for HNSCC PAIRS under operating room lights;
Aim 2 - Optimize the PAIRS model in HNSCC tumors and derive clinical imaging parameters; and
Aim 3 - Validate the clinical viability of PAIRS in both murine xenografts and spontaneous, volunteer dog
 model as compared to traditional and single, fluorescent-agent guided surgical resection.
The translational INNOVATION will include production of a fully integrated PAIRS system, and a robust set of
clinical imaging parameters. To expedite clinical translation of PAIRS, we will leverage two fluorescent agents
currently being used in clinical trials: ABY-029 (a fluorescent anti-EGFR Affibody® molecule) and IRDye
700DX. In addition, the clinical SIGNIFICANCE of PAIRS to reduce morbidity and increase survival will have
been demonstrated in both the controlled environment of murine xenografts as well as the high variability of
spontaneous veterinary cancers in dogs. As a translational biophysical chemist, I have lead the development of
the paired-agent model as a tissue identifying technique and have assembled a strong team of notable cancer
and clinical imaging researchers.

10799771,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive malignancy with limited therapeutic options.
Combining chemotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has improved TNBC treatment, supporting
the premise that DNA damage resistance and immune evasion are of importance for TNBC progression.
Nonetheless, TNBCs often exhibit intrinsic or acquired resistance to these agents, emphasizing the need for
developing new strategies for the treatment of recalcitrant advanced TNBCs.
 Our work supported by this grant has demonstrated that the transmembrane MUC1-C oncoprotein, which
is aberrantly expressed in TNBCs, contributes to the cancer stem cell (CSC) state, DNA damage resistance
and immune evasion. MUC1-C consists of a 58 aa extracellular domain and a 72 aa cytoplasmic domain that
contribute to TNBC progression. These findings have supported the development of agents that target the
MUC1-C extracellular and cytoplasmic domains for the treatment of advanced refractory TNBCs.
 Funding by this grant supported generation of the MAb 3D1 antibody that targets the MUC1-C extracellular
domain at a conserved alpha-3 helix. Our work on MAb 3D1 has resulted in the development of allogeneic anti-
MUC1-C CAR T cells with pharma that are now in the clinic for the treatment of TNBCs and other cancers.
MAb 3D1 is also being developed as an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) with the NCI NExT Program for IND-
enabling studies and early phase evaluation as an immunotherapy for TNBC patients.
 We anticipate that, as for other anti-cancer agents, patients with TNBC will develop resistance to these
anti-MUC1-C MAb 3D1 CAR T cells and ADCs. To address this potential outcome, our proposed work focuses
on the development of novel strategies directed against the MUC1-C extracellular domain at a unique
conserved alpha-4 helix. Our objective is to develop new immunotherapeutic agents that circumvent potential
resistance mechanisms which emerge against the anti-MUC1-C agents already in the clinic.
 Our work has also focused on the development of agents that target the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain,
which is activated by chronic inflammation and promotes carcinogenesis. We developed the first-in-class GO-
203 inhibitor that blocks this region and thereby the MUC1-C oncogenic function. The proposed studies will
focus on the development of GO-203 and other new agents that target the MUC1-C cytoplasmic domain and
are delivered to TNBC CSCs using our recently formulated Quatramer platform.
 Our rationale is that these anti-MUC1-C agents will, like most therapeutics, be limited by resistance
mechanisms and that new approaches will be needed for targeting the MUC1-C extracellular and cytoplasmic
domains. The hypothesis is that our new anti-MUC1-C agents will be effective when used alone and in
combinations with genotoxic and immune-based therapies, which will be addressed in studies of (i) human
TNBC CSCs, (ii) GEMMs, and (iii) TNBC tumor specimens with the objective of advancing TNBC treatment."
10804608,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has an immense burden on healthcare, with a prevalence of 37 million in the
American population. Untreated CKD leads to fibrosis and declining renal function until a patient requires life-
sustaining renal replacement therapy, so there is a critical need for treatment options to halt or reverse the
progression of disease. My lab has characterized a pro-inflammatory cell type, originating from the failed repair
of injured proximal tubule (FR-PT) cells, that correlates with failed recovery from acute kidney injury (AKI) and
subsequent transition to CKD. Single cell RNA and ATAC sequencing of human adult kidney samples has
provided evidence for this cell state’s presence in kidneys that have not experienced AKI. As such the FR-PT
cell could represent a convergence point for acute and chronic renal injury through which progressive
inflammatory and fibrotic signals are perpetuated, leading to CKD progression. A treatment that inhibits or
reverses transition to a failed repair state could ameliorate CKD outcomes by reducing the FR-PT cell
population responsible for continued pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic signaling. Since FR-PT cells appear to
be a distinct population from healthy proximal tubule (PT) cells, gene regulatory mechanisms may be an
important contributing factor to the formation of FR-PT cells. This project will reveal the gene regulatory
networks and regulatory elements underpinning development of the FR-PT cell population through analysis of
a single cell multiomic dataset generated by integrating single cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq profiles of adult
human kidney, specifically focusing on characterizing transcriptional and epigenetic differences between
healthy PT and FR-PT cells. This dataset will be used to train a parametric gene regulatory network model for
PT cells to identify candidate cis- and trans-regulatory elements involved in the transition between healthy and
failed repair PT states. This will be followed by experimental validation of the identified regulatory elements to
confirm their predicted role. This proposal aims to identify therapeutic candidates targeting FR-PT cells as a
driver of CKD progression, addressing an outstanding need for better CKD therapies. Completion of this
project will also help me achieve my training goals to expand my scientific knowledge, learn to identify and
study translatable research questions, and gain experience with bioinformatics and single cell techniques. Dr.
Benjamin Humphreys is a model physician-scientist for these goals, and his laboratory is an optimal
environment for this project and my training goals, because of his research group’s single cell expertise and
the lab’s excellent training and collaborative atmosphere. Successful completion of this project will contribute a
better understanding of CKD and possible treatment strategies and will prepare me to pursue a career as an
independent physician-scientist."
10809853,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The recent marked increase in misuse and abuse of opioids and the epidemic of opioid overdose mortality
have greatly affected our society and global community. Given that non-human primate models offer the most
phylogenetically appropriate evaluation of opioid receptor functions and drug effects, the goal of this proposal
is to determine the functional efficacy and selectivity of cannabidiol, a non-intoxicating constituent of cannabis,
in ameliorating heroin-associated side effects in primates. Previous studies demonstrate that cannabidiol
reduced reinstatement of heroin-seeking behavior specifically triggered by a prior drug-associated cue in
rodents. The proposal will further investigate the funcitional profiles of cannbidiol as compared to clinically used
medications, naltrexone and buprenorphine, in modulating two major aspects of opioid-induced adverse
effects, i.e., abuse liability and respiratory depression. The proposal contains two aims: 1) To determine the
functional efficacy and selectivity of cannabidiol to attenuate the abuse-related effects of heroin, and 2) To
determine the functional effectiveness of cannabidiol to modulate heroin-induced respiratory depression.
These non-human primate behavioral assays have been designed specifically to reflect the therapeutic
potential of the test compound along with clinically used medications for modulating opioid-assoicated abuse
liability and adverse effects and assess its functional efficacy and selectivity. Our unique set of behavioral and
physiological assays in awake, behaving non-human primates, in combination with the rigorious
pharmacological desgin and analysis, provides a translational relevance to advance our understanding of
potential therapeutic of cannabidiol in modulating the abuse liability and adverse effects of heroin and sheds
light on future clinical interventions and the treatment options for opioid abuse."
10811371,"Project Summary
This developmental R21 study proposes a secondary data analysis addressing specific questions regarding
the mediating pathways by which childhood maltreatment (CM) experienced by mothers may place their
children at greater risk for externalizing and internalizing symptoms in adolescence. Using innovative models
from developmental neuroscience, this study explores novel frameworks for understanding associations
between maternal CM and offspring psychopathology. The subsample is drawn from the ongoing Family Life
Project (FLP) and is comprised of mothers who reported that they did or did not experience CM at or before the
age of 14 (N=1122).
There is growing interest in the long-term consequences of CM and its association with the socioemotional
adjustment of survivors and their children. Prior research links CM history across numerous domains of adult
interpersonal functioning, including elevated depression, intimate partner violence (IPV), and problems in the
parental role. Children of mothers with trauma histories are reported to have significant adjustment difficulties
when compared to children of women without self-reported CM. Despite the strength of evidence linking
maternal CM history and offspring psychopathology, there is heterogeneity in outcomes for survivors of trauma
and their children.
Our goal is to identify the underlying mechanisms by which maternal CM may be related to psychopathology
among offspring in adolescence. We propose a dimensional model of adversity focused on examining how
different types of risk factors may be differentially related to the development of children whose mothers report
CM. Using novel methods to achieve a precise and systematic identification of the processes that account for
the heterogeneity of outcomes among offspring of women with CM histories, will not only open new avenues
for research identifying factors that may protect or interrupt potential links between maternal CM and offspring
psychopathology, but also provide more clear road maps for future intervention development. A major area of
innovation includes the use of a rich longitudinal dataset that has a comprehensive array of biological,
neurocognitive, behavioral, caregiving, and ecological measures from age 6-months – age 16, allowing us
perhaps for the first time, to examine the intergenerational effects of CM. To our knowledge this is the first
study of its kind to test complex longitudinal relations among early adversity, deprivation, fear learning, stress
physiology, hypervigilance, and key outcomes in a racially and economically diverse sample. The high
prevalence rates for CM in the United States, suggests a significant number of children are living in homes with
mothers reporting trauma histories making this an important direction for further inquiry."

The objective of this proposal is to define the impact of maternal viral infections and inflammation on immune
programming within the fetal brain and lymphoid organs in a well-defined non-human primate (NHP) model.
Discoveries in fetal human immunology have primarily come from human cord blood with few studies of fetal
blood or the innate immune capacity of major organs. The link between innate immune activation and fetal brain
injury is unknown but is of major translational significance to guide novel therapies for fetal protection. Our
central hypothesis is that the fetal innate immune programming induced by a maternal ZIKV infection or
other infectious triggers initiates a program of cellular stress-response in the fetal brain. This connection
between the fetal immune programming and cellular stress-response pathways in the fetal brain has never been
studied across gestation or with a suite of diverse and highly sophisticated immunologic tools and platforms. Our
preliminary studies in a microculture ex vivo model using human fetal tissues demonstrate active regulation of
the innate immune response by Sendai virus (SeV; a model virus inducing innate immune activation) and Zika
virus (ZIKV) by 24 hours post-infection. Our preliminary data reveals that 3 days after a maternal ZIKV infection
in our NHP model, there is a strong correlation in the fetal brain linking the innate immune response with induction
of cellular stress and autophagy. In this proposal, we will use the NHP model to obtain a complete collection of
fetal blood and major tissues from the first and third trimesters to interrogate maturation of fetal innate and
adaptive immune programming in the fetal brain and major lymphoid organs, which we will link to cellular stress
in the fetal brain. In Aim 1, we will use an ex vivo microculture model to determine innate immune pathways
activated by model viruses (ZIKV, SeV), Type I IFN (IFN-β), IL-6 and TNF-α in the first and third trimesters within
NHP fetal brain and lymphoid organs (fetal brain, placenta, spleen, thymus, blood). In Aim 2, we will use a
pregnant NHP model of an acute ZIKV infection to link the profile of fetal innate and adaptive immune activation
with production of alarmins and induction of the autophagic response in the fetal brain. In both Aims, we will
employ diverse immunologic tools (CyTOF, Nanostring nCounter, Luminex, ELISA, immunohistochemistry, bulk
and single cell RNA-Seq) producing high-dimensional data that can be leveraged using bioinformatics to reveal
gene networks of innate immune programming that direct viral and inflammatory injury of major fetal organs in
early and late gestation, which can inform therapeutic approaches for fetal neuroprotection in the setting of
inflammatory preterm birth or congenital viral infection."

About 25% of daily care interactions between staff and residents in long-term care including Assisted Living
Facilities (ALFs) comprise of poor care interactions. Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias
(ADRD) are especially at risk for poor care interactions related to ineffective staff approaches such as negative
touching, being overprotective, and lack of verbal or non-verbal contact during care. Poor care interactions have
a negative impact on both resident and staff well-being and therefore, need to be replaced with positive care
interactions. Use of positive care approaches such as identifying resident’s abilities and preferences,
understanding resident’s responses and non-verbal cues, appreciating resident’s effort, managing self-responses
to resident, and using a calm and respectful approach can promote positive care interactions in ALFs and further
improve outcomes for both residents (e.g., less behavioral distress) and staff (e.g., greater competence in
dementia care). Yet, we continue to see poor care interactions in ALFs due to resident’s ADRD-related
communication challenges and behaviors, staff’s limited knowledge and skills in caring for residents with ADRD,
and organization’s limited support and engagement in initiating and sustaining positive approaches. Therefore,
the purpose of this study is to pilot test the Promoting Positive Care Interactions (PPCI) intervention with the
goal of establishing a feasible and culturally responsive approach to optimize care interactions between staff
(nursing, activity, housekeeping, and dining service) and residents with ADRD in ALFs, and further improve
select resident, staff, and organizational outcomes. PPCI is a theory-based four-step intervention consisting of 1)
stakeholder engagement in developing facility specific goals; (2) environment and policy assessments; (3)
flexible staff education; and (4) ongoing mentorship, motivation, and support (in-person visits and text
messages) for staff to optimize care interactions in ALFs. Aim 1 will examine the feasibility and acceptability of
PPCI. We will also explore the cultural responsiveness of PPCI. Aim 2 will test the preliminary efficacy of PPCI
on select resident outcomes (primary: quality of life; secondary: agitation, resistiveness to care), staff outcomes
(primary: quality of care interactions; secondary: knowledge, perceived competence related to care and
communication, stress, relationship quality), and organizational outcomes (environment and policies). Aim 1
will use a convergent parallel mixed-method design with surveys and focus groups completed at six months. For
Aim 2, repeated (resident, staff, and facility) measures will be evaluated at baseline and six months. Data will be
analyzed using mixed methods for aim 1 and count models for aim 2. This study will support to establish a feasible
and culturally responsive approach to optimize care interactions and further improve ADRD care in ALFs.
Findings will inform future implementation of PPCI."

Hearing is an active process that works in concert with vision. How and where the active processes in
hearing contribute to interactions with vision is presently unknown. One possibility is that these
interactions occur at the earliest stages of the auditory pathway – within the ear. Several types of physical
actuators located inside the ear, namely the middle ear muscles and outer hair cells, collectively adjust
eardrum motion and generate endogenous, subthreshold sounds known as otoacoustic emissions. We
recently discovered a new type of such sounds: eye movement-related eardrum oscillations, or EMREOs.
This discovery implicates the ear’s internal actuation systems in a form of multimodal processing.
However, the mechanism that generates EMREOs is presently unknown. Understanding this mechanism
will shed light on the functional consequences of eye movements for hearing and how hearing coordinates
with vision.
We will test the contributions of these actuators to EMREOs in an animal model, selectively interrupting
each component surgically or via local application of ototoxic substances. We will compare the results of
these studies to results obtained in human hearing loss patients suffering from middle ear muscle or outer
hair cell dysfunction. We hypothesize that the middle ear muscles and outer hair cells work in concert to
produce the EMREO, and that dysfunction of any of the actuator systems will lead to anomalies in
EMREOs. Possible perceptual consequences of such dysfunction will also be probed.
Together, these experiments will shed light on how the brain adjusts the auditory transduction system
when eye movements shift the relative alignments of the eyes and ears. That oculomotor signals occur at
the very gateway of the auditory pathway represents a fundamental shift in our understanding of the scope
and mechanisms employed in hearing, and in particular how the auditory system interfaces with the visual
system. The findings will be relevant to a variety of hearing disorders involving the ears’ internal actuators
or their top-down control, including sensorineural hearing loss and age-related hearing loss, as well as
complex sensory/cognitive syndromes such as dyslexia and autism."

10814809,"Abstract
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) is an incurable genetic based cardiac
disease that causes sudden death in young adults and athletes. ARVD/C is termed a “disease of the
desmosome” as 40-50% of mutations in ARVD/C patients are found in desmosomal (junctional anchor) genes,
with plakophilin-2 (PKP2) being the most frequently mutated desmosomal gene. Evidence suggests that altered
RNA splicing may be a critical mechanism through which PKP2 patient genetics drive ARVD/C. However, no
models and limited mechanistic insights exist into how human desmosomal mutations in RNA splicing impact
ARVD/C and what form of therapeutics would be impactful in these settings. Through CRISPR-Cas9 we
generated a novel mouse model globally harboring a human PKP2 mutation (IVS10-1 G>C) that impacts RNA
splicing. PKP2 homozygous mutant (PKP2 Hom) mice selectively display all adult hallmarks of ARVD/C including
sudden death. RNA and sequencing analyses revealed low levels of a larger PKP2 transcript that retains an
intronic sequence. Protein analyses of PKP2 Hom hearts revealed low levels of a higher molecular weight PKP2
mutant protein that was expressed in the absence of endogenous PKP2. Strategies to increase wild type PKP2
and mutant PKP2 protein in PKP2 mutant neonatal cardiomyocytes suggested that splicing effects on PKP2
haploinsufficiency mechanistically drive cell junction deficits in early ARVD/C. Targeted restoration of PKP2
protein dose in neonatal PKP2 Hom mice had therapeutic potential in late ARVD/C as it restored cardiac
mechanical junction complex and prolonged life in adult PKP2 Hom mice. PKP2 Hom mice provide an ideal test
platform to assess the impact and mechanism of PKP2 restoration in circumventing ARVD/C in classic patient-
centric models during early and late stages of disease. Prime editing (search-and-replace) strategies have come
to age as novel methods to correct single base mutations and address the “root cause” of ARVD/C, though
limited studies have applied this technology towards therapeutic use in disease settings. We hypothesize the
PKP2 RNA splicing mutation is sufficient to drive ARVD/C through a mechanism impacting splicing
consequences on PKP2 protein dose. PKP2 targeted strategies (gene therapy and prime base editor-directed
correction) can be exploited to therapeutically alter ARVD/C. We aim to determine: (i) the pathogenic mechanism
by which PKP2 RNA splicing mutations drive ARVD/C, (ii) the impact and mechanism of early and late PKP2
restoration in our novel PKP2 mutant mouse and human ARVD/C models, and (iii) a base editing strategy to
correct the PKP2 (IVS10-1 G>C) mutation and assess its impact in our novel PKP2 mutant ARVD/C model."

 Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting 2 million Americans in
whom it may cause skipped heart beats, dizziness or stroke. Unfortunately, therapy for AF has limited
success, likely because AF represents heterogenous and poorly characterized disease entities between
individuals. A central challenge is that it is not clear why a specific therapy works in a given AF patient.
This uncertainty makes it challenging to develop a patient-specific approach to tailor therapy for
personalized medicine.
 The premise of this project is that mechanistic data is increasingly available in AF patients at
scales spanning tissue, whole heart and patient levels, yet rarely integrated. We set out to use machine
learning (ML), a powerful approach proven to classify complex datasets, to integrate data to address 3
clinical unmet needs. First, electrograms are rarely used to guide therapy in AF, unlike organized
rhythms, because they are difficult to interpret. Second, it is difficult to understand how arrhythmia is
affected by any specific ablation strategy in AF, unlike organized rhythms. This makes it difficult to
improve therapy. Third, it is difficult to identify whether an individual patient will or will not have success
from AF ablation. We applied machine learning and novel objective analyses to these questions to
develop strategies for personalized AF therapy.
 We have 3 specific aims: (1) To identify components of AF electrograms using ML trained to
monophasic action potentials (MAP); (2) To identify electrical and structural features of the acute
response of AF to ablation near and remote from PVs; (3) To identify patients in whom ablation is
unsuccessful or successful long-term, who are poorly separated at present. Each Aim will compare ML to
traditional biostatistics, and use objective explainability analysis of ML to provide mechanistic insights.
 This study has potential to deliver immediate clinical and translational impact. We will apply
specific ML approaches, biostatistics, and computer modeling to our rich multiscale registry. We will
develop practical and shareable tools, which we will prospectively test clinically, to deliver meaningful
outcomes at tissue, whole heart and patient scales. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology,
computer science, signal processing and biological physics. This project is likely to reveal novel
multiscale AF phenotypes to enable personalized therapy."

Routine HIV treatment with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) eliminates nearly all actively infected cells.
Nevertheless, the small reservoir of residual cells, some of which can remain dormant for long periods of time
before becoming active and producing new virus particles, represents a crucial barrier to completely curing the
disease. Substance use disorders introduce further challenges—for example, many immune cells express opioid
receptors and undergo significant molecular changes after opioid exposure, which can increase their vulnerability
to HIV infection. Our recent work suggests that the global transcriptomic and epigenomic changes during
hematopoietic differentiation affect viral latency and activation. Additionally, we recently found that global
inhibition of histone deacetylase activity in HSPCs increases viral activation, further implicating epigenomic
changes in activation. Deciphering the contributions of addictive substances, inflammatory stimuli, and cell state
to HIV infection and latency is crucial for ongoing efforts to cure HIV. In particular, the following fundamental
questions remain unanswered: How does substance use change the transcriptomic and epigenomic states of
immune cells? How do these changes in turn affect HIV infection and latency? How do the effects of substance
use on HIV infection and latency vary across different immune cell types and states? Here, we will combine our
experimental platform for identifying latently and actively infected cells, single-cell transcriptome, and epigenome
sequencing, and our recently developed computational integration methods to investigate these questions. Our
interdisciplinary team combines expertise in HIV basic science, HIV clinical treatment, and bioinformatics to
develop an experimental and computational framework for integrated gene expression, chromatin accessibility,
histone modification, and insertion site profiling into a single picture of how opioids affect viral infection and
latency. Specifically, this project will (1) use single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC-seq, and single-cell Cut&Tag
to map diversity of infected cell response to opioid exposure, (2) investigate the relationship between immune
cell type and differentiation state and viral activation, and (3) determine viral integration sites through single-cell
RNA-seq. Together, these aims will produce a comprehensive, integrated transcriptomic and epigenomic atlas
of how HIV-infected immune cells respond to opioid exposure as well as how opioids impact HIV infection. Our
work also develops a broadly applicable experimental and computational framework, laying a foundation for the
discovery of novel insights into HIV infection and latency in the context of substance use disorders."

This R03 proposal is for a 2-year multidisciplinary research project that spans the fields of stroke rehabilitation
and stroke genomics. The central premise in this research is that the transcriptional profiles of circulating immune
cells (peripheral blood mononuclear cells, “PBMCs”) convey information about the severity and progression of
stroke that could be used to inform decisions on the timing of neurorehabilitation. The long-term goal is to use
this information to tailor neurorehabilitation programs based on each patient’s unique biological timeline of
recovery. The key investigators have combined expertise in neurorehabilitation (Dr. Robynne Braun, PI) and
transcriptomics (Dr. Susan Dorsey, Co-I), with further collaborative contributions from the University of Maryland
Stroke Genetics Research Center and the Program in Personalized and Genomic Medicine. By delineating a
chronology of peripheral immune cell responses post-stroke, the results will provide an analytical framework to
identify immunological events associated with post-stroke motor recovery. These studies will fill an existing gap
in the research on recovery-related blood biomarkers for stroke. The proposed research is innovative in pairing
longitudinal transcriptomics with domain-specific measures of stroke recovery and quantitative measures of
corticospinal tract integrity. It is significant for its potential to shift rehabilitation research toward greater
integration of genomic and phenotypic data that ultimately could inform personalized approaches to treatment.
Upon completion of this work we will know: 1) what genes are expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells
during the first 30 days post-stroke 2) whether any of these genes are differentially expressed based on the
severity of motor system damage and 3) whether any of these genes align with previously identified biological
phases of stroke recovery in animal models. These findings will furthermore serve as a resource to the broader
rehabilitation research community by providing a rich repository of genomic and phenotypic data accessible
through dbGaP, the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes."

Abstract:
 Aedes aegypti is the primary vector for a number of human pathogens, including dengue virus (DENV;
Flaviviridae, Flavivirus), Zika virus (ZIKV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus), chikungunya virus (CHIKV; Togaviridae,
Alphavirus) and yellow fever virus (YFV; Flaviviridae, Flavivirus), all of which present a continued threat to
human health worldwide. Understanding the endemic and epidemic risk of these arthropod-borne (arbo-)
viruses is critical to the success of public health preparedness and intervention. One key entomological
parameter informing risk estimates is vector competence (how able a mosquito is to become infected and
transmit an arbovirus; VC). Quantifying the competency of local vector populations can help inform the risk that
any one pathogen poses to a given community. This is often quantified in the laboratory by exposing
populations of local mosquitoes to an infectious bloodmeal and harvesting tissues at set time-points post
infection. While informative, this approach often fails to consider the biology and behavior of the vector
mosquito. For example, it is known that wild Ae. aegypti mosquitoes will imbibe several bloodmeals over the
course of a traditional laboratory-based vector competence study (e.g. bloodmeal every two to three days). To
address these shortcomings, we recently began examining the effects that multiple blood feeding episodes
have on the competency of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes for ZIKV. Our preliminary findings reveal that providing a
second non-infectious bloodmeal to ZIKV infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes enhances viral escape from the
midgut and significantly shortens the duration between mosquito acquisition of ZIKV to transmission. In this
application we will examine the effects that multiple bloodfeeding episodes have on arbovirus infection of and
transmission by vector mosquitoes. Specifically, we will be 1) testing this phenomenon in other virus-vector
pairings, 2) evaluating the role of the midgut basal lamina in mediating the double-feed phenotype and 3)
determining if similar processes are mediating the ability of arboviruses to infect ovarian tissue and be
transmitted vertically."

Severe lung disease is an increasingly recognized life-threatening complication of systemic juvenile idiopathic
arthritis (SJIA-LD), representing a distinct and highly inflammatory interstitial lung disease that affects as many
as 1 in 20 children with SJIA. While the etiology of SJIA-LD is unknown, it is strongly linked to macrophage
activation syndrome, (MAS), episodic systemic hyperinflammation with SJIA that is driven by interferon gamma
(IFNγ). We recently reported that SJIA-LD and MAS share prominent features of IFNγ activation, supporting a
key role for this pathway in the pathogenesis of SJIA-LD. However, the mechanisms by which IFNγ activation
drives pulmonary inflammation in SJIA-LD is unexplored. In addition, the widespread use of anti-IL-1 therapy for
SJIA has been linked to markedly increased incidence of SJIA-LD including distinct clinical features and
development of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). Our proposed studies provide a critical step to identify the
mechanistic causes of SJIA-LD, a necessary step towards developing targeted treatment strategies for and
ultimately to prevent SJIA-LD. The objective of this application is to define the mechanisms by which MAS and
persistent IFNγ drive the pathogenesis of SJIA-LD. Accordingly, our central hypothesis to be tested is that
persistent IFNγ pathway activation leads to alveolar macrophage dysfunction and lung inflammation in SJIA-LD
and is amplified by anti-IL-1 biologic therapy. To study the mechanisms of SJIA-LD, we will utilize overlapping
approaches in our established mouse model system to directly test effects of persistent IFNγ on pulmonary
inflammation, and the requirement of IL-1 signaling for alveolar macrophage functional phenotypes. In parallel,
we will define IFNγ-driven functional polarization phenotypes of alveolar macrophages in children with SJIA-LD.
Specific Aim 1 will determine whether persistent IFNγ activation is the key driver of lung inflammation during
MAS. We hypothesize that persistent IFNγ activation during chronic/recurrent MAS leads to the development of
lung disease in mice. Specific Aim 2 will identify mechanisms of alveolar macrophage reprogramming in
experimental MAS. We hypothesize that IL-1 blockade in the setting of persistent IFNγ activation during MAS
reprograms alveolar macrophages towards inflammatory phenotypes and inhibits anti-inflammatory/resolution
and homeostatic functions. Specific Aim 3 will define IFNγ-driven alveolar macrophage populations in children
with SJIA-LD. We hypothesize that alveolar macrophage subsets in SJIA-LD display an IFNγ-driven inflammatory
phenotype that prevents normal homeostatic functions. We anticipate that the proposed experiments will define
the function of persistent IFNγ activation and IL-1 blockade as drivers of lung inflammation and alveolar
macrophage dysfunction in MAS and SJIA-LD. Together these studies will advance our long-term goal of
identifying the causes of and developing novel treatment approaches for SJIA-LD."
10815636,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Approximately 40% of individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have chronic kidney disease (CKD), also
known as diabetic kidney disease (DKD). DKD is the leading cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD), and
ESRD is the most expensive complication of diabetes. African American adults are almost twice as likely to
have DKD and are three times more likely to progress to ESRD. Inner-city populations, made up of
predominantly African Americans, are at high risk for DKD. Challenges of living in the inner-city include
multidimensional adversity, defined as having three or more social adversities such as loss of employment,
housing instability, food insecurity, transportation needs, utility needs, interpersonal safety, and financial strain.
African American adults living in the inner-city disproportionately experience multidimensional adversity, which
impacts the complex self-management of DKD such as self-monitoring and behavior modification. The
compounded risks of being African American, living in the inner-city, having T2DM and multidimensional
adversity likely contribute to the accelerated rate of CKD progression among African American adults and
potentiate existing health disparities. Patient education and self-management behaviors improve patient
outcomes and represent the cornerstone of DKD management. In addition, behavioral intervention studies in
African American adults with T2DM incorporating cultural tailoring, peer-support/coaching, and community
health workers have shown promise in improving short-term clinical outcomes. However, their benefits are not
sustained long-term, and they do not produce long-term effects on lifestyle and behavior changes. Further,
majority of existing studies do not account for the unique challenges of inner-city African American adults
which limits effectiveness of patient education and self-management behaviors in African American adults
living in the inner-city long-term. Similarly, studies in African American adults with T2DM and CKD that
incorporate the challenges of living with multidimensional adversity are scarce, despite growing evidence which
recognizes the negative effects of multidimensional adversity on clinical outcomes in this population.
Therefore, the goal of this proposal is to address these gaps in knowledge using a convergent parallel mixed
methods study design to understand the role and effect of multidimensional adversity in African American
adults with DKD. In addition, this proposal will identify appropriate intervention components which will inform
the development of a culturally tailored intervention that addresses multidimensional adversity to improve
clinical outcomes, quality of life, and self-care behaviors in African American adults with DKD living in the
inner-city. Ultimately, findings from this proposal will serve as a preliminary data for addressing
multidimensional adversity in a large-scale appropriately powered, multicenter, randomized controlled trial
focused on African American adults with DKD."
10815637,"ABSTRACT
Type 2 diabetes disproportionately affects those with low socioeconomic status (SES), while unfavorable
neighborhood factors — such as lack of physical activity resources, limited healthy food options, socioeconomic
disadvantage and barriers to health care — often intersect with low individual SES, compounding disparity. This
intersectionality of multiple levels of influence (individual, neighborhoods, society) results in highly vulnerable
populations at greater risk for developing diabetes, and likely contributes to marked regional variations in
diabetes risk. Given that approximately 88 million adults in the U.S. have prediabetes, and most structured
diabetes prevention approaches (e.g. lifestyle modification and medications) require significant time and financial
investment, efforts that enable health care providers to prioritize the most high-risk patients would optimize
benefit. Diabetes risk prediction models can be used to identify individuals at high-risk for progression to
diabetes; however, traditional models include clinical parameters with little integration of social factors, ignoring
the multiple levels of influence on disease prevention. Thus, integrating social determinants of health (SDoH)
data into risk stratification has the potential to identify high-risk individuals based on clinical and social
vulnerabilities, facilitating better targeted interventions and reductions in disparities. Importantly, risk stratification
approaches that utilize SDoH in the electronic medical record (EMR) may provide an avenue to improve diabetes
outcomes and address disparity at the population level. Moreover, understanding how to recruit and engage
high-risk, socially vulnerable patients, as well as how to individualize prevention efforts — such as the Diabetes
Prevention Program — has potential to improve diabetes outcomes and health equity at the population level.
Therefore, the goals of this K01 proposal are to: (1) evaluate the addition of SDoH to a validated diabetes risk
prediction model — the cardiometabolic disease staging (CMDS) — to determine improvement of risk
classification in two population-based cohorts; (2) determine the prevalence of adults at high-risk for diabetes,
both clinically and socially, in the UAB Health System using risk stratification; and (3) identify strategies to
engage high-risk, socially vulnerable individuals in diabetes prevention using stakeholder engagement.
Conducting this research, in combination with the training and mentoring plan proposed, will help me to obtain
skills and experience in health disparities and SDoH measurement; stakeholder engagement and qualitative
methods; and diabetes clinical outcome measurement. This award will allow me to develop my independent
research path focusing on utilizing social determinants of health (SDoH) data to inform the design of better
tailored initiatives for the prevention of cardiometabolic disease. This study will provide the groundwork to inform
a future trial to assess the effectiveness of delivering the Diabetes Prevention Program, based on clinical and
SDoH factors, to ultimately decrease disparities."
10785944,"Abstract
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a genetic disorder caused by bi-allelic inactivating mutations in tumor
suppressor genes TSC1 or TSC2, leading to progressive lung destruction and eventually the requirement for
lung transplantation. Rapalogs, the only FDA-approved treatments for LAM, induce a cytostatic effect with
stabilized lung function. However, lung function continues to decline upon treatment cessation. Thus, there is
an urgent need for better treatment, potentially leading to a cure for this devastating disease.
The monogenetic nature of LAM makes messenger RNA (mRNA) replacement an attractive therapeutic
modality, which requires safe and efficacious delivery of functional mRNA to the lung and specifically into TSC-
deficient cells. We have developed lung-specific synthetic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and showed in our
preliminary data that in vivo organ-selectivity of LNPs can be precisely tuned by changing the linker structure in
the lipidoid tails without complicating the LNPs formulation. Furthermore, we developed LAM cell-targeting hybrid
LNPs that efficiently deliver functional TSC2 mRNA into TSC2-deficient cells and suppress mTORC1 pathway.
mRNA replacement therapy significantly reduced tumor burdens in preclinical LAM models. Remarkably, mRNA
therapy induced T cell tumor infiltration in the otherwise immune cold tumor microenvironment.
We hypothesize: 1) improved lung-specific tumor-targeting LNPs will assist developing mRNA therapy for LAM,
which provides a novel therapeutic strategy to achieve durable effects and complete response; 2) LNP-assisted
mRNA therapy can reprogram LAM-like cells back to a “normal” state without affecting normal tissue, and can
re-normalize LAM microenvironment; 3) multi-omic single cell analysis will reveal mechanism of action of mRNA
therapy and help improve LNP design. Our hypotheses will be tested in the following Aims:
Aim 1. To develop and optimize lung-specific synthetic lipid nanoparticles for LAM-targeted mRNA therapy.
Aim 2. To determine therapeutic efficacy of LAM-targeting nanoparticle-assisted mRNA therapy for LAM.
Aim 3. To determine mRNA therapy-induced LAM cell reprogramming and LAM microenvironment remodeling
by integrative single cell multiomic analyses.
The scientific and preclinical impact of this project are 1) development of LAM cell-targeted mRNA therapy;
2) proof-of-concept that mRNA therapy can achieve durable response; 3) molecular understanding of LAM cell
reprogramming and LAM microenvironment restoration by mRNA therapy. The success of this study will open
a new therapeutic paradigm of mRNA therapy with the potential of durable effects and complete remissions."
10789845,"The long-term goal of this project is to improve the outcome of surgical procedures
involving skeletal muscle transfer, whether muscle transposition or transplantation. Under
previous support from V.A. Rehab R&D, we characterized the design of muscles involved in
tendon transfer surgery and developed high-resolution tools with which to study them. In this
proposal, we exploit a relatively rare surgical procedure for brachial plexus injury, in which the
gracilis muscle is surgically isolated and then transplanted into the arm to act as an elbow
flexor. The key idea is that this surgical procedure allows us, for the first time, to completely
characterize a single human skeletal muscle intraoperatively and then to predict and
subsequently test its function in vivo. Further, because gracilis is the only muscle acting at the
elbow we can explicitly test our model to optimize this and related types of surgery since no
other muscles are involved in the elbow flexion movement. Our three aims are (1), to measure
gracilis muscle sarcomere length and active and passive mechanical properties intraoperatively
during surgical transplantation in 30 patients, (2) to compare predicted and actual function of the
transferred gracilis muscle one- and two-years postoperatively, and (3) to develop a practical
tool to train surgeons to perform these complex procedures.
 This proposal consists of three aims. The first two aims are interconnected. Aim 1
presents a sophisticated intraoperative experiment in which gracilis muscles are measured in
vivo, in isolation, and then after transplantation into the arm. This aim is based on our previous
intraoperative experience with tendon transfer surgery and biomechanical testing of muscle.
The novelty of this experiment is that, for the first time, a complete structural and functional data
set will be obtained from a single human muscle. In aim 2, using a deterministic model of
muscle function (rather than current models which are indeterminate and must be solved by
optimization), we will determine whether the typical biomechanical modeling approaches used in
the field can accurately predict elbow flexion torque given the most detailed set of tissue-level
parameters ever directly collected from a human muscle. If it is, this will be the first explicit
validation of such an approach. If it is not, we will be able to identify and isolate the factor(s)
that are obstacles to simulation validity.
 Aim 3 came directly out of our discussions with surgeons at the Mayo Clinic. We have
spent a tremendous amount of time training them regarding muscle active and passive
mechanical and functional properties as we perform these procedures. However, they
encouraged us to create a training tool that would allow other surgeons across the country to be
trained using the same concepts but not in the actual operating room. Aim 3 does just that by
programming an ergometer to “feel” just like a muscle in the operating room and then to practice
“transferring” it based on its known properties.
 Successful completion of this project will improve our understanding of human skeletal
muscle biomechanics, test our ability to model human joint function, and provide concrete
surgical guidelines for this brachial plexus surgery and related tendon transfer surgeries."
10789952,"Title: Using Digital Solutions to Improve Transition of Care for Patients with Acute Kidney Injury
The overarching objective of the proposed mentored patient-oriented career development award (K23) is to
develop an acute kidney injury (AKI) research program that utilizes behavioral science principles and digital
health solutions, fostering Dr. Ng’s development to an independent researcher.
AKI, a sudden decline in kidney function, occurs in 16-25% of hospitalized patients. If AKI is not addressed
during the transition of care from the hospital to outpatient setting, patients are at risk for recurrent AKI and
rehospitalization. Achieving optimal transition of care for AKI is challenging, because AKI information is poorly
communicated both to outpatient providers and patients. Outpatient providers cannot address AKI
complications nor monitor kidney function, when they are unaware of patient’s AKI status. Additionally, patients
lack the knowledge and self-management skills for AKI (e.g., follow kidney-specific dietary restrictions or avoid
medications harmful to the kidneys). To improve AKI information flow to providers and patients, the candidate
proposes to adapt and evaluate: 1) an AKI section for discharge summary; and 2) the feasibility of a text
messages to support patient education and self-management. The Specific Aims are: 1a) adapt existing
discharge summary to include AKI information, and test usability; 1b) design and adapt text messages for an
AKI management and education tool (AKI-MET); and 2) evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary
efficacy of intervention components in a 2 sequential pilot RCTs.
Dr Ng has completed a master’s degree in clinical epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania, through
which she gained experience in epidemiology, biostatistics, and study design. Her previous training and
experience in AKI epidemiology research and qualitative research have prepared her to engage in the work
proposed in the studies. Dr Ng is positioned to use this award to launch an independent research career in the
rich research and training environment at the Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell. Through her
proposed career development, she seeks to gain skills in: 1) application of health information technology and
digital health intervention; 2) behavioral science and behavioral intervention design; 3) RCT design, conduct,
and analysis, including longitudinal data analysis from the pilot trial; and 4) professional development. Dr. Ng
has assembled a multi-disciplinary mentorship team led by experts in the field. Upon completion of these K23
activities, she will be well-positioned to submit an R01 for a larger RCT to assess the effectiveness of AKI
transition-of-care tool in improving health outcomes."
10789953,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Passively transferred broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are being evaluated in clinical trials for HIV-1
treatment and prevention. The results of these studies in macaques and humans suggest that bnAbs have
antiviral activity and possibly a “vaccinal” effect, i.e. induction of HIV-specific cellular immune responses. After
several years of infection, approximately 5-15% of HIV-1 infected individuals develop some ability to cross-
neutralize a broad range of heterologous viral strains, with only 1% of individuals developing potent bnAbs. It is
possible that individuals with chronic HIV-1 infection have elicited precursors of HIV bnAbs, but that these
responses have been stunted by viral escape or by affinity maturation away from highly conserved epitopes. If
HIV bnAb precursors have indeed been elicited in these individuals as our preliminary data indicates, then such
responses could be boosted by delivery of native-like HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimers. Development of therapies
that may induce bnAb in vivo would be a valuable advance for both HIV-1 treatment and prevention. We
conducted neutralization assays with curated virus panels that are particularly sensitive to VRC01-class
precursor antibodies, V2 apex-precursors and PGT 121 precursor antibodies and demonstrated that the baseline
frequencies of bnAb precursors was ~20% in a small cohort (N = 25) of chronically HIV 1-infected individuals
receiving suppressive ART. We therefore propose to test if bnAbs can be induced by immunization with native-
like Env trimer vaccination in chronic, ART-suppressed HIV-1 infection, including in individuals who have initiated
the appropriate pathways of B-cell somatic hypermutation through natural infection. Native-like trimers mimic the
structure of Env on the surface of the virus largely correctly and display multiple bnAb epitopes in a manner
similar to how these epitopes appear on the virion-associated spike, and can induce autologous primary virus
(Tier-2) responses in animal models .Accordingly, we will conduct a Phase 1, randomized, placebo controlled,
exploratory dose-escalation study evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of a native-like trimer vaccine, VRC-
HIVRGP096-00-VP (Trimer 4571), developed and provided to us by the NIH Vaccine Research Center, in HIV-
1 infected individuals on suppressive ART. We will assess vaccine induced changes in autologous and cross
clade virus neutralization and trimer-specific antibody response. Additionally, we will perform detailed
mechanistic studies to investigate the effect of bnAb precursor presence on bnAb B-cell lineage development,
characterize epitope specificities and assess trimer-induced changes in the B cell repertoire. Using multiple,
state-of-the-art assays, we will measure the effect of the immunogen on the size of the peripheral blood HIV-1
reservoir and potential sieving effect on the residual plasma viremia and cellular HIV Env RNA. Trimer induced
virologic and immunological assessments will provide new insights into the conditions and the benefits of these
neutralizing antibody responses toward achieving sustained HIV-1 remission without ART."

 Advances in design and actuation have led to dramatic improvements in prosthetic limbs. However, these devices cannot
provide sensory feedback, which leads to slow gait and increased risk of falling. Recent evidence from our lab has shown
that stimulation of lateral structures in the spinal cord and dorsal roots can effectively generate sensations in the distal limbs.
In these studies, lateral SCS (LSCS) evoked sensations in regions of the amputated hands or feet, though many of these
sensations also covered more proximal regions of the residual limb. To achieve more focal sensations in the missing limb
will require development of electrodes with smaller contacts, tighter inter-contact spacing, and better arrangements than
currently exist for SCS electrodes. Further, because the lateral epidural space is narrower and more curved than the
traditional midline target of SCS, these novel SCS electrodes must be thinner and more flexible than existing SCS devices.
 Our long-term goal is to create a neurostimulation system to restore sensation by selectively stimulating lateral
structures in the spinal cord. In this project, we will characterize how the DR respond to LSCS and optimize
electrode design for stimulating these structures. Through a combination of large animal neurophysiology experiments,
histological analyses, and computational modeling studies, we will characterize the selectivity of LSCS and design
electrodes to maximize selectivity and achieve focal paresthetic coverage of the foot and ankle while avoiding injury to the
underlying neural tissue. To achieve these goals, we will complete the following aims:
 Aim 1: Quantify functional organization of the lumbar DR and selectivity of LSCS.
 We will measure the selectivity of LSCS in cats by recording antidromic propagation of evoked action potentials in
nerves throughout the hindlimb. We will also resect the dura and use hook electrodes to repeat these experiments while
selectively stimulating individual DR to characterize their innervation patterns and somatotopic arrangement.
 Aim 2: Develop an anatomically-accurate computational model of the spinal cord, including the DR, and use that
model as a platform to design LSCS electrodes.
 Utilizing high-resolution imaging data and microsurgical measurements of the human spinal cord, we will build a
combined finite element and equivalent circuit model to simulate the anatomy and neurophysiology of lateral structures in
the human spinal cord and their response to LSCS. We will use this platform to design the layout of electrode contacts on
the LSCS device and stimulation configurations and waveforms to maximize selectivity of stimulation of individual DR.
 Aim 3: Perform large animal surgeries to optimize the mechanical properties of the LSCS electrode substrate to
avoid neural damage and maintain chronic stability of electrode placement.
 In pigs, we will chronically implant LSCS electrodes with multiple different mechanical substrate designs, including
varying the cross-section of the device and any tooling that may aide in insertion and stabilization of the device. We will
perform histological analysis to characterize tissue damage and the relationship between mechanical properties and tissue
injury."
10931622,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Excessive alcohol use and alcohol-associated liver disease are two of the leading causes of morbidity and
mortality worldwide. The gut microbiome can modify an individual’s risk for progression of alcohol-associated
liver disease via microbe-derived metabolites such as ethanol. Patients with Autobrewery Syndrome (ABS), a
condition where dysregulated gut microbiota produce high levels of ethanol that is then absorbed into the
bloodstream leading to symptoms of intoxication, are a unique and ideal population for studying the host effects
of gut microbial ethanol production. My preliminary data confirms that gut microbiota from ABS patients produce
more ethanol in culture than that of their controls. Because chronic alcohol consumption can increase gut
permeability, which is associated with persistent psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and increased
bacterial translocation to the liver resulting in liver disease progression, we hypothesized that endogenous gut
microbial ethanol production could cause similar effects. Indeed, my additional preliminary data demonstrates
that gnotobiotic mice humanized with high ethanol-producing gut microbiota from ABS patients demonstrated
increased voluntary alcohol use behavior compared with control-humanized mice and increased hepatic
inflammatory gene expression. I then confirmed that the gut microbiota of a subset of patients with alcohol use
disorder also produce significant amounts of ethanol in culture. These observations have led to my central
hypothesis that pathologic gut microbial ethanol production is an independent risk factor for increased alcohol
consumption and exacerbation of liver disease. Hence, the aims of this application are to 1) characterize the
gut microbiota of patients with ABS and identify microbes responsible for high levels of ethanol production, 2)
examine how pathologic gut microbial ethanol production affects host alcohol use and liver disease progression
and test antimicrobials as a therapeutic strategy, and 3) establish gut-microbial ethanol production as an
independent risk factor for a subset of patients with alcohol use disorder and alcohol-associated liver disease.
My proposed studies will advance our understanding of the biological mechanisms that drive ABS and
predisposition for increased alcohol use and liver disease progression, and test potential therapies. The
proposed research and career development plan, along with my mentors, advisory committee, and resources at
the University of California, San Diego, will provide the support and additional training necessary for me to
become an independent physician scientist studying the gut-liver-brain axis in an academic research
environment."

10837156,"Project Summary
 The aging population is on the rise. By 2030, for the first time, both the population older than 65 and
those younger than 18 years will contribute equally with 21% to the overall US population.
 Organ transplantation is hampered by a limited supply of organs with many patients waiting for numerous
years and numerous patients dying before getting a transplant. Organs from older donors are available, however,
frequently not considered or discarded with concerns of compromised function and augmented immunogenicity.
 We have previously documented the impact of aging in clinical transplantation and have dissected some
of the mechanisms that drive the augmented immunogenicity of older organs. We have identified old intragraft
dendritic cells (DC) as drivers of an IL-17-driven immune response. Mechanisms that activate old DCs, however,
remain to be determined. In additional preliminary data, we have now documented a systemic increase of cell-
free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mt-DNA), a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that accumulates in aging.
Notably, blocking TLR-9, the ligand for mt-DNA, reduced the immunogenicity of old DCs and prolonged the
survival of old transplants. Additional preliminary data documented a compromised clearance of senescent cells
in older mice. Senolytics, agents that deplete senescence cells reduced inflammatory responses associated with
ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in an age-dependent fashion. In specific aim 1, we will therefore define the
impact of aging on DAMP release and delineate whether the transplantation of old organs can promote
inflammation via the dissemination of senescent cells. Our preliminary experiments have also shown that the
communication between DCs and T cells is impacted by aging. In specific aim 2, we will therefore elucidate the
underlying mechanisms that promote mtDNA release and inflamm-aging. Here, we will test the role of nitrogen
permease regulator-like 3 (NLRP3) and will assess whether elevated DAMP levels mediate inflammation via this
signaling pathway in an age dependent manner. We have also accumulated preliminary data showing that
senolytics reduced mtDNA levels while ameliorating DC and T-cell activation in an age-specific fashion.
Additional preliminary data have also shown that a single application of senolytics in older donor animals
prolonged transplant survival. We thus submit that senolytics will have the capacity to improve organ quality and
reduce the augmented immunogenicity in aging. In specific aim 3, we will therefore dissect the translational
capacity of senolytics administered to donors, recipients, or as an addition to the preservation solution.
 We believe that our proposal is built on a strong collection of preliminary data, the availability of unique
experimental models and the support of a distinctive group of researchers. We are thus confident that our
proposal will contribute substantially to an improved understanding in an area of unmet need."

Understanding the mechanisms and identifying regulators of immune cell development and
differentiation are critical for developing new and more effective therapeutics. The fast
advancement of genomic technologies provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the
immune cells at the system level. The noise in the high throughput measurements and the
complexity of multiple omics data make it an urgent need for developing novel and powerful
systems biology approach for integrative analysis to reveal the underlying regulatory
mechanisms for immune system. We propose a new method to integrate multiomics data at the
genetic network level for identification of key regulators deciding the cell state and cell fate
(Specific Aim 1). We will apply the method to systematically uncover the regulatory mechanisms
in the mouse immune system by analyzing 86 immune cell populations (Specific Aim 2). We will
also perform comparative analysis of the human and mouse immune cells to reveal the
conserved regulatory code for immune cell specification (Specific Aim 3). We will rigorously
assess the performance of the computational analysis, experimentally confirm the importance of
the identified key regulators and investigate their roles in regulating immune cell functions. Once
complete, the proposed work will provide not only a general tool for integrative analysis of
multiomics data but also specific mechanistic insights for understanding the regulation of
immune system functions."
10816502,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Reversible serine/threonine phosphorylation of proteins plays an essential regulatory function in numerous
cellular processes. Type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) comprise a major class of Ser/Thr phosphatases
(PPases), and defects in several human PP2Cs have been implicated in cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, neural disorders, and stress signaling. However, major gaps exist in understanding how PP2C
enzyme activity is regulated and what specific proteins and processes are under PP2C control. In plants,
PP2C.D PPases inhibit organ growth by repressing cell expansion. In part, this is accomplished by
dephosphorylation of a key regulatory phosphosite of plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPases. The growth
hormone auxin stimulates cell expansion by inducing expression of Small Auxin Up RNA (SAUR) genes, which
encode novel proteins that bind to PP2C.D PPases to inhibit enzymatic activity. The long-term goal of this
project is to thoroughly understand the molecular mechanisms underlying auxin-mediated control of plant
growth and development. More specifically, the work described in this proposal will identify regulators and
downstream effectors of SAUR-PP2C.D signaling hubs involved in auxin-mediated cell expansion and the
integration of volumetric changes with diverse cellular processes to yield a coordinated growth response.
 Phosphoproteomic studies have identified >140 proteins exhibiting altered phosphorylation in response to
auxin. This dataset overlaps substantially with phosphoproteins affected by SAUR overexpression, implicating
SAUR-PP2C.D modules as major regulators of the auxin phosphorylome during cell expansion. Using the
powerful genetic system of the model plant Arabidopsis, the proposed studies will investigate the functional
roles of select phosphoprotein candidates in auxin-induced growth and their regulatory interactions with SAUR-
PP2C.D modules. Detailed analysis of auxin’s regulation of PM H+-ATPase activity will also be conducted.
Auxin both inhibits H+-ATPase dephosphorylation via SAUR repression of PP2C.D activity and stimulates
activation by promoting ATPase phosphorylation by TMK1 and additional kinases, including orthologs of WNK
and SPAK/OSR kinases implicated in mammalian cell size control. All of these kinases interact with one
another and PP2C.D PPases, and research will address how kinase and phosphatase activities are
coordinated and mutually regulated. This work will elucidate PP2C functions and regulatory mechanisms,
identify PP2C.D effectors that modulate cell expansion, and illuminate how auxin coordinates diverse cellular
processes to control cell size. Given the conservation of PP2C function across kingdoms and the universal
process of cell size control, project findings will have broad impact, including implications into human
development and disease. Further, as humans depend on plants for sources of food, fiber, and
pharmaceuticals, the proposed studies will elucidate plant growth control by SAUR-PP2C.D regulatory
modules and facilitate novel strategies for manipulating plant growth to benefit human health."
10816505,"This project seeks to further the understanding of the genomic etiology of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Genetic
studies have identified loci associated with the disorder; however, the genetic architecture of AUD has not been
fully explained. Currently, genome-wide variant data of the disorder are available for analysis, and functional
genomic datasets are being generated from consortia. Sequencing data from biobanks would allow assessment
of the contribution of coding and functional non-coding regions to AUD risk by using a proxy phenotype from the
information of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) report. Prior work has shown that 1) AUD
has a high genetic overlap with some neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs), and 2) common-variant studies identify
biological pathways associated with the disorder. Therefore, integrative analyses which incorporate multi-omics
datasets and overlapping genetic information can help identify additional loci associated with the disorder. Thus,
the candidate plans to use integrative methods to 1) increase power for genetic discovery, and 2) better
understand the genomic architecture for AUD. AUD has a high genetic correlation with the AUDIT-based
phenotype (AUDIT-P) which assesses the problematic consequences of drinking. AUD and AUDIT-P have
similar genetic correlations with other NPDs. Multiple AUDIT-P datasets are publicly available, and a recent
meta-analysis of AUD and AUDIT-P datasets shows increased statistical power for risk loci identification. For
this reason, this proposal centers on identifying the genomic association for problematic alcohol use which
includes AUD itself and/or AUDIT-P. To achieve this research goal, the candidate proposes the following aims.
First, he plans to extend his previous methods to jointly analyze rare exonic variants and other omics datasets.
Second, he will develop methods to integrate common variants, omics information and genetic overlap
information to increase power for multi-trait analysis. Third, he proposes an integrative method to analyze rare
variants from whole-genome sequencing data. Fourth, he will apply these methods to analyze large-scale variant
and functional-genomic datasets. He plans to use systems biology approaches to elucidate analysis results from
these methods. Also, he proposes using genetic model organisms (C. elegans) to better understand the results
from computational approaches via RNA interference and CRISPR-Cas9 experiments. Dr. Nguyen has a
background in mathematics, statistics and statistical genetics; however, he has not had prior experience in the
field of genetics of AUD. The mentor team including leading experts in the field will help him to 1) gain expertise
in the basic principles of psychopathology, alcohol related phenotypes, the nosology of NPDs and alcohol related
phenotypes; 2) acquire understanding of genetic model organisms, RNAi and CRISPR-Cas9 experiments for
validation of computational results; 3) gain expertise in additional types of omics data; and 4) develop needed
independence in his career. These training goals will aid him in successfully conducting the proposed work, and
building a NIH-funded translational research program focused on AUD and its comorbid conditions."
10816507,"Project Summary
Mutations in the Survival of Motor Neuron 1 (SMN1) gene and low levels of its translated product, the SMN
protein, provoke the frequently fatal, infantile-onset neuromuscular disorder, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).
Afflicted individuals invariably carry a copy gene, SMN2. However, SMN2 produces only residual protein
owing to a splicing defect. Still, given the cause of SMA and the invariable presence of SMN2 in patients, it is
not surprising that the copy gene has served as the most common target for the treatment of the disease. The
strategy of targeting SMN2 is embodied in one FDA-approved agent, Spinraza®, which restores the SMN
protein by correcting the splicing defect in the gene. Small molecule modulators of SMN2 and therapies that
exploit viral vectors to directly restore SMN add to the choice of therapeutic agents that replenish the protein to
treat patients. While these developments and SMN repletion in general, raise considerable optimism for the
treatment of SMA, they have done little to shed light on precisely how SMN paucity preferentially disables the
neuromuscular system. Besides, it is still quite uncertain if restoring SMN as currently practiced will be
curative or merely delay the onset of disease. Already it is clear that the most effective outcomes require early
treatment; symptomatic patients derive considerably less benefit, and it would not be surprising if even pre-
symptomatic treatment merely converts a fatal disease into a chronic one. Here we propose experiments that
address gaps in our understanding of the basic biology of SMA as a means to better and more assured clinical
outcomes. Accordingly, in Aim 1, we wish to identify a novel determinant of the SMA phenotype by exploiting
strain-specific differences in model mice that turn a severe form of the disease into a remarkably mild one. We
hypothesize that the gene/factor in question is related to a chaperone modifier we have identified and thus
likely shares functions with the chaperone in what could imply a novel pathway, synaptic proteostasis, in SMA.
In Aim 2, we will focus on the original chaperone modifier with experiments designed to explore its potential as
a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of motor neuron disease. We propose that the chaperone, via its
effects on proteostasis, potentiates neurotransmission at the neuromuscular synapses of individuals afflicted
with SMA. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate how reduced SMN in skeletal muscle contributes to the
neuromuscular SMA phenotype. We posit that low SMN affects muscle, at least in part, through its effects on
resident progenitor cells, disrupting the ability of these cells to self-renew and thus impairing muscle repair and
regeneration. If successful, the project will a) identify a novel suppressor of the SMA phenotype, b) reveal a
distinct neuromuscular disease-relevant pathway that impacts disorders like SMA and, c) explain how SMN
maintains skeletal muscle – the underlying rationale for targeting this tissue to optimally treat the human
disease."
10816511,"Summary
With approximately ninety thousand alcohol-related deaths per year, alcohol is the third leading preventable
cause of death in the United States. Alcohol (ethanol) is addictive and produces complex effects on the body,
primarily through its interactions within the central nervous system. The structural, cellular and circuit
mechanisms by which ethanol imparts its effects on the brain and leads to alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are
poorly understood. A large number of studies have demonstrated that ethanol directly alters the function of ion
channels, such as the G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channel. Studies of GIRK channel
knockout mice and human GWAS also implicate GIRK channels in mediating some of the effects of ethanol in
the brain. However, current pharmacological tools for selectively modulating GIRK channels are limited. The
overall objectives of this grant are to elucidate how ethanol alters brain function and identify new ligands for
treating AUD. Previously, we identified and characterized a GIRK activator, called GiGA1, which selectively
activates GIRK1/GIRK2 channels, does not require G proteins, reduces the excitability of neurons via
activation of endogenously expressed GIRK channels, and exhibits anti-convulsant properties. GiGA1 has not
been thoroughly tested in the context of AUD, however. Here, we hypothesize that GiGA1 activation of
GIRK1/2 channels will mitigate some of the deleterious effects of alcohol on brain reward circuits. Specifically,
we will evaluate the effects of GiGA1 on alcohol-regulated behaviors (conditioned place preference, binge
drinking, and ethanol intake escalation induced by chronic intermittent ethanol vapor inhalation), determine
actions of GiGA1 on alcohol-regulated circuits in the NAc using in vivo fiber photometry to measure activity and
release of neurotransmitters, and develop GIRK2-selective small molecule modulators. Currently, there is a
limited number of FDA approved drugs for treating alcoholism and an urgent need for new approaches for
treating AUD. Defining the physical pocket for ethanol has been critical for understanding how the binding of
ethanol to a channel can lead to changes in channel activity and affect brain function. Now, bridging earlier
studies on how ethanol activates GIRK channels via the alcohol pocket and extending to an innovative
approach of using structural biology to guide screening and selection of novel therapeutics, we are advancing
compounds that directly activate subtypes of GIRK channels and probing their efficacy in mouse models of
AUDs."
10850970,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ngo) is the etiological agent of the sexually transmitted infection (STI) gonorrhea, a high
morbidity disease with ~100 million cases worldwide each year. Alarmingly, therapeutic and pharmacologic
approaches to treat gonorrhea are under threat by the global emergence of `superbug' strains resistant to all
clinically useful antibiotics. Gonococci are exquisitely adapted to life in humans, to the extent that they have shed
much of the metabolic capacity typical of other bacteria and depend upon unique strategies that allow for
replication and immune evasion while colonizing human mucosal tissues. Reflecting this specialization, Ngo
genomes encode less than half the number of proteins observed in more prototypical bacteria such as E. coli. A
biological enigma then is how the neisserial genome has evolved to exploit a variety of mucosal niches and how
strain variation contributes to pathogenesis. Our hypothesis is that this depends on specialized protein-protein
interaction networks, and that acquiring this knowledge will have major clinical value because it would reveal
protein complexes and processes uniquely required by gonococci but not commensal species, either because
they have distinct functional capabilities or because the smaller neisserial genome lacks functional redundancy
that allow other bacteria to overcome environmental or other stresses. The core goal of our multidisciplinary
research strategy is the generation of global protein interaction networks of gonococci that offer a detailed
systems-based understanding of the specialized cellular apparatus used by Ngo during infection. While
population genomic, transcriptional profiling and genetic screens have provided valuable insights into Ngo
biology, these studies would gain significant benefit through their integration with comprehensive roadmaps
detailing the organization of protein complexes that support growth and infection phenotypes. Key to the clinical
relevance of this project is a focus on the impact of strain variation through investigations of infectious clinical
isolates of Ngo, supported by complementary investigations of the population genomics of Ngo. We will combine
quantitative mass spectrometry, network analysis, comparative genomics and targeted mutagenesis with in vitro
and in vivo phenotype analysis to illuminate macromolecular protein assemblies that are critical to infection and
clinical persistence within the genital mucosa. By the end of this grant, we will have identified key conserved
components of the physical circuitry driving gonococcal growth, infection and adaptation to human mucosal
tissues, providing mechanistic insights into its unique pathobiology, and laying the foundation for future clinical
intervention strategies to combat infectious disease."

10817189,"ABSTRACT – CANCER RESEARCH TRAINING AND EDUCATION COORDINATION (CRTEC)
The O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center (O’Neal) is strongly committed to strategically preparing the next
generation of cancer researchers, physicians, and early stage investigators with the tools necessary to be
dynamic leaders in cancer research and treatment. Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination
(CRTEC) is led by the Associate Director for Education and Training, assisted by a full-time Education
Coordinator, and is guided by the mission of O’Neal with input from an Internal Advisory Committee. In order to
seamlessly integrate cancer training and education of biomedical researchers, population scientists, and health
care professionals into programmatic efforts, we established the Cancer Training and Career Development
Office (CTCDO) housed at O’Neal. The CTCDO aligns its training programs closely with those of the eight
Schools, and the Center for Community Outreach Development. CTCDO interacts with O’Neal Research
Programs, Community Outreach and Engagement, and Shared Resources to provide outstanding opportunities
for learning, scientific discussions, and career enhancement at O’Neal.
In this section, we describe the role of the CTCDO (i) in educating and training the next generation of cancer
clinicians and researchers and (ii) in effectively reaching out to, and training, individuals from populations that
are historically underrepresented in cancer research, to create a more inclusive workforce that serves the needs
of the diverse society in our catchment area.
To maintain and expand O’Neal’s cancer research career enrichment activities, CTCDO has developed three
specific aims for the next five years. Aim 1: Develop and enhance cancer education and training activities across
the UAB community. Aim 2: Enhance the career success of early-stage investigators in cancer-focused research
by providing career enrichment activities. Aim 3: Create pathways for underrepresented minority populations at
all training stages to pursue careers in cancer research and cancer care.
CTCDO adds value to O’Neal by (1) building and maintaining an infrastructure that coordinates and facilitates
our diverse, expansive, and established cancer-related education and training opportunities; (2) improving and
evolving cancer-related training activities for trainees at all levels; (3) augmenting professional growth of faculty
through a multi-disciplinary faculty mentorship program, formalized grant-writing initiatives, and peer review
programs; (4) enriching educational opportunities for oncology healthcare professionals at O’Neal and affiliate
partners in our state; and (5) enhancing inclusion of underrepresented minorities in the cancer workforce
including trainees from diverse racial/ethnic minorities, lower socioeconomic households, and rural populations
who represent a significant untapped pool of talent from the O’Neal catchment area."
10824210,"Our studies have established that there is an early regenerative response initiated by
the neural stem cells and progenitors (NSPs) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) in
response to a perinatal hypoxic-ischemic (H-I) insult and that the expansion of the NSPs
requires the cytokine leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF). We have collected new data that
reveals other functions of LIF as LIF haplodeficient animals sustain worse injury
compared to wild type mice. Complementing those loss of function studies, we provide
preliminary data to show that delayed intranasal LIF administration, reduces the extent
of cerebral neuronal loss, increases proliferation in the SVZ and improves neurological
function in a mouse model of near term hypoxia-ischemia. Therefore, the premise of
this proposal is that LIF is an essential neuroprotective and regenerative cytokine
and that the non-invasive, intranasal administration of LIF can promote
regeneration and decrease the long-term burden of neurological deficits. We will
test this premise by performing experiments using pre-term and near-term mouse
models of perinatal injury with the following 3 specific aims: 1) that LIF haplodeficient
mice will sustain greater neuronal and glial cell damage after a developmental brain
injury accompanied by worse neurological disabilities; 2) that delayed intranasal LIF
administration will stimulate the numbers of stem cells and progenitors to repair the
damaged gray and white matter and 3) that the extent of axonal regeneration and
function can be improved by delayed intranasal LIF administration. During the course of
our studies we will elucidate the mechanisms through which LIF is exerting its potent
neuroprotective and regenerative actions. As it is likely that many perinatal insults occur
during the antenatal period and go undetected, the knowledge obtained from these
studies could lead to therapeutics that could be administered to infants subacutely to
enable the damaged brain to develop normally from its endogenous stem cells, thus
decreasing the incidence and life long cognitive, motor and emotional handicaps that
occur as a result of developmental brain damage."
10822555,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is one of the most widely used methods in molecular diagnostics
today. PCR amplifies short regions of DNA and, with a reverse transcription step to convert RNA to cDNA,
PCR will amplify from RNA sequences. The importance of PCR was reinforced during the SARS-CoV-
2/COVID-19 pandemic, where its use as the de facto gold standard for monitoring infection made the acronym
an everyday term in popular culture. PCR also became a standard method for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 in
wastewater. While many advances in PCR methods and instrumentation have been made over the years,
current instruments and methods involve multiple compromises in terms of speed, sample size, versatility, and
portability. Notably, conventional benchtop PCR instruments (thermal cyclers) have a wide range of
functionality including both endpoint (final product) PCR and real-time/quantitative PCR (qPCR), but they are
slow, requiring 1-2 hours to obtain results.
 With this Phase I application, we propose advancement of a PCR instrument and methods that can
achieve performance like a benchtop PCR instrument in terms of versatility, while also offering greatly
improved speed, cost, and portability. This work builds on our prior experience on optical heating methods for
PCR and takes advantage of recent technological advances to achieve the performance enhancements. Here
we propose development of a rapid and versatile qPCR (rvPCR) instrument. Testing will be performed for
detection of respiratory viruses, specifically SARS-CoV-2, Influenza A, and Influenza B."
10819552,"Hantaviruses are the causative agents of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Americas and Eurasia, respectively. These viruses are usually transmitted from their rodent reservoirs to human. However, multiple incidents of person-to-person transmission of a South American Andes hantavirus raises significant public health concern about these deadly viruses with up to 40% case fatality rates. No FDA-approved hantavirus vaccines and therapies exist. Cellular entry and infection of hantaviruses is mediated by its virion surface Gn/Gc glycoproteins, which are also the main target of protective immune responses. However, our understanding of the molecular determinants of Gn/Gc in hantavirus entry and antigenicity remains limited, at least partly, due to the general requirement of Biosafety level-3 (BSL3) containment for hantavirus research and the lack of a reverse genetics system. To address these limitations, multiple BSL2 pseudovirus systems have been developed. However, current BSL2 systems are limited by poor scalability and limited diversity of the generated viruses due to their inefficient plasmid-based rescue, which makes them incompatible with a more comprehensive analysis of the biology and function of the entry glycoproteins. Here, we propose to fix this major shortcoming of the hantavirus field by developing a novel BSL2 system that allows comprehensive reverse as well as forward genetic analysis of Gn/Gc’s role in virus entry and antigenicity."
10818264,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is characterized by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in pancreatic
islets where there is currently no prevention or cure. The processes driving T1D initiation and progression in the
pancreas are poorly understood, and improved understanding of these processes in the pancreas is critical to
gain new insight into disease mechanisms and identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. A wealth of
data has been generated in human pancreas donors in initiatives supported by the Human Islet Research
Network (HIRN) which can be used to address open questions in T1D, yet these data are currently both under-
utilized and in formats inaccessible to many researchers which prohibits insights. To address this gap, we have
assembled a team of highly accomplished researchers to create a pancreatic knowledge base PanKbase
leveraging our expertise in computational biology and data science (Gaulton, Flannick, Voight), type 1 diabetes
(Rich, Atkinson, Anderson, Gauton, MacDonald), islet biology (Gloyn, MacDonald), immunology (Anderson,
Atkinson), knowledge base engineering (Flannick, Gaulton), engagement and outreach (Burtt, Westley), and
rigor and reproducibility (Grethe, Martone). For this proposed project we will in Aim 1 develop a database that
comprehensively aggregates and harmonizes data in HIRN repositories and other repositories containing human
pancreas data based on our existing CMDGA platform. We will further derive high-quality summary resources
from these harmonized data that are of value to the community. In Aim 2 we will implement an analytics library
of tools that address impactful questions in T1D by performing statistical modeling and machine learning of data
and resources, and that extrapolate knowledge learned from these data into large, independent datasets, as
workflows in multiple formats including Github repositories, Jupyter notebooks, WDL pipelines, and pre-
computed results. In Aim 3 we will create an open science platform accessible to any user that provides user-
friendly interfaces to customizable workflows that address impactful questions, an analysis sandbox to run
advanced workflows and pipelines, and APIs and code repositories for full customization, based on the
HuGeAMP and Terra platforms. In Aim 4 we will form collaborations and working groups with investigators
leading HIRN repositories to develop standards and pair experts with data scientists to integrate domain
knowledge into resource creation and machine learning applications using our expertise coordinating consortia.
In Aim 5 we will establish engagement and outreach programs for the broader research community to improve
data, workflows, and user experience in PanKbase and identify new key questions in the field by applying our
extensive expertise in developing outreach for AMP-CMD and the digital platform the (sugar)science. Together
this proposal will provide a knowledge base of the pancreas which will enable researchers across all expertise
levels to extract novel insight and relationships from data in HIRN and other pancreas donor repositories, which
will expedite the development of biomarkers, therapies, and prevention strategies for T1D."

outreach programs in English and Spanish that include the presence of our Community Advisory Board, Memory
Enhancement Program seminars, new written and web-based information, and community events that publicize
the latest developments in dementia research such as the importance of prevention and biomarker studies. Our
outreach efforts will expand to more cognitively health or mildly impaired elders through our culturally diverse
Recruitment Registry. The Core will accomplish targeted recruitment in part by creating an Accelerator
comprised of researchers, community stakeholders, clinicians, caregivers and diverse community elders to
identify research priorities, address barriers to research participation and guide the development of recruitment
strategies and tools to serve the Clinical Core and other allied researchers. Retention and engagement will be
fostered through expanding our successful programs (e.g. Participant Appreciation day, and the Newsletter) as
well through as a new program featuring a social worker. This new retention program, which is currently funded
by philanthropy, addresses caregiver needs as well as exploring potential barriers to research participation.

One hundred years ago dementing illnesses were classified based upon their clinical presentation and
neuropathology. The promise of the twenty first century is that we will be able to classify these same diseases
by the genetic cause or genetic risk factors, a classification based upon etiology not symptomatology. During the
last three decades many genes have been shown to cause autosomal dominant forms of early onset dementing
illnesses. These rare disorders have provided enormous insight into the pathogenesis of more common variants
of the same diseases. In 1993, a polymorphism in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene was identified as the first
genetic risk factor for AD. A dose-dependent effect of the APOE4 allele has now become an important variable
in all studies of AD. During the last ten years genome-wide association studies and next generation sequencing
studies have begun to identify many novel risk factors for AD. The goal of the Genetics and Genomics Core of
the ISMMS ADRC is to provide genetic data and biospecimens on all ADRC participants. We will obtain blood
samples on ADRC participants. One blood sample will be sent to NCRAD, where it will be available to the entire
community and will be included in national AD Genetics initiatives such as ongoing genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) and whole genome/exome sequencing projects. The second tube will be retained locally. For
DNA. Plasma and APOE genotype will also be available on all ADRC participants. Many participants will also
have GWAS, exome array and/or whole exome/genome sequence data through national and international
initiatives and ADRC affiliated projects. This data will be stored in the master ISMMS ADRC database and
provided to investigators upon request. The Core will support projects and other cores as well as ADRC affiliated

translational efforts, for understanding heterogeneity of the disease, and for identifying resilience factors. The
proposed Biomarker Core will consolidate and bolster existing efforts involving biomarker research with the goals
of improving early diagnosis, identifying indicators of resilience, characterization of disease heterogeneity, and
acceleration of clinical trial efforts. The aims of the Biomarker Core are to: 1) Provide services for biomarker
collection and analysis on the ADRC cohort and to facilitate ADRD research broadly. The Core will coordinate
biomarker characterization of the ADRC cohort using the NIH-AA research framework (A/T/N). The Core will
provide recommendations for acquisition with specific MRI sequences, PET tracers, and fluid biomarkers;
analytic pipelines; and expertise to support project design. 2) Promote wide and rapid sharing through
interactions with other Cores, across the institution, and with outside institutions. The Core will facilitate
informatics for banking and sharing processed neuroimaging data and fluid samples, help to route biomarker-
characterized participants to best-matched studies and trials, and support a culture of open science to encourage
collaborative efforts across institutional boundaries. 3) Leverage imaging biomarker data to catalyze
development of innovative projects focused on biomarkers as early indicators of disease risk and to characterize
heterogeneity and resilience factors. The Core will actively work with investigators to optimize inclusion of
biomarkers in projects and will provide access to biomarker-characterized participants. 4) Develop the future
through biomarker training and involvement in project-based activities. The Core will provide biomarker training
to REC trainees and to investigators new to ADRD research, consult with investigators to develop projects
involving biomarkers, and will link clinical ADRD researchers to technical expertise in biomarkers. Across these
aims, the Core will emphasize the early stages of disease (preclinical and mild cognitive impairment), with a goal
of maximizing utility to existing observational projects and increasing the likelihood that characterized participants
will remain in the sample for enrollment into clinical trials. The Core will prioritize characterization of under-
represented minorities to contribute to health disparities research and increase the generalizability of ADRD
biomarker research. These Core activities will support acquisition, analysis, informatics, and data sharing to
integrate biomarker research into the efforts of the ADRC to accelerate understanding of disease hetereogeneity
by illuminating biological differences associated with vulnerability or resilience factors that underlie the
expression of clinical symptoms."

meetings to Internal and External Advisory committees. The Core ensures that activities encourage innovative
research for all members, but especially for early-stage investigators, and foster community engagement via
multi-directional dialogue among M-LEEaD scientists, community members, and regulatory stakeholders. The
Core coordinates responses to urgent environmental concerns, including interactions with other core centers,
NIEHS, and relevant organizations. Finally, the Core is responsible for evaluation of the efficacy of M-LEEaD
programs, cores, and activities, taking corrective action as warranted. Through this leadership, the
Administrative Core ensures a high standard of activities for the translation of basic research findings into
practical applications to advance a comprehensive and integrated environmental health paradigm."
10815570,"ABSTRACT (Integrated Health Sciences Core)
The mission of the Michigan Center on Lifestage Environmental Exposures and Disease (M-LEEaD) is
to accelerate research that defines the impact of environmental exposures during vulnerable life
stages and promote translation of research findings to improve clinical and public health interventions
for the mitigation of human disease. In support of this mission, M-LEEaD’s Integrated Health Sciences
(IHS) Core facilitates multi-directional interaction among environmental health scientists, clinical researchers
and practitioners, quantitative research scientists, and environmental health practice professionals, leading to
enhanced translation of research findings into public health practice. In this competing renewal, we build on
successes in strengthening connections between research and community and practice needs, in
partnership with the Community Engagement Core (CEC). The IHS Core goals are: to identify and
facilitate access to human and animal biobanks, to promote multi-directional translational research, to
ensure quality of research designs, to provide statistical support, and to link investigators with services
provided by M-LEEaD cores and other UM resources. The IHS Core offers cutting-edge statistical
methods to advance environmental health research and facilitates translation to practice and policy.
The IHS Core provides a critical linkage function promoting translational scholarship and multi-
directional stakeholder partnerships, through close coordination with CEC. Specifically, the IHS Core
aims to 1) provide Center investigators with high-quality study design, laboratory, and repository
protocols, and statistical support for advancing environmental health research; 2) educate and train
Center investigators, staff, students and practitioners in study design, community-engaged research,
laboratory practice, curation of bio-repositories, and statistical methods through seminars and
workshops; 3) promote interdisciplinary collaborations that foster translational research; 4) maintain
and update the searchable, web-based Kiosk to provide information on human and animal studies and
core services of the M-LEEaD Center; and 5) catalyze multi-directional partnerships, in coordination
with CEC, with practitioners and community members to connect research on environmental risk
factors to locations where people live, work, and play through-out the life-course. The IHS Core
provides center members with both basic/routine statistical support and cutting-edge statistical
methods to advance environmental health. The IHS Core facilitates the M-LEEaD translational
research vision by hosting an environmental statistics and an environmental health practice workshop
series. Dissemination of workshops occurs via the M-LEEaD website, and the IHS Core has achieved
specific impact in addressing environmental health concerns in Michigan (e.g., PFAS/PBB) by offering
presentations, webinars and symposia attended by scientists, practitioners, and community members."
10815573,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (Exposure Assessment Core)
The Exposure Assessment (EA) Core provides critical support to advance the Michigan Center on Lifestage
Environmental Exposures and Disease (M-LEEaD) mission through a broad range of exposure assessment
services for M-LEEaD scientists. The EAC conducts exposure analyses in pilot projects, facilitates the design,
implementation, analysis and characterization of environmental exposures, and expands the use and
capabilities of exposure measurements. The EA Core helps to ensure that exposure assessments and
analytical data generated and used by Center members are scientifically sound, quality-assured, and reflect
state-of-the-art knowledge and expertise. The EA Core also furthers the translational vision and initiatives of M-
LEEaD by participating in outreach and translational initiatives aimed at informing policy and the lay public. The
specific aims are to: (1) provide analytical services to measure and characterize environmental exposures for
research investigating exposure-disease links; (2) provide consultations, referrals and other services that
support exposure assessment activities; (3) coordinate and leverage exposure assessment activities related to
exposure assessment, particularly biomonitoring; (4) advance the performance and capability of exposure
measurements; and (5) disseminate exposure assessment related information to Center investigators and
outreach to the public and other stakeholders. The EA Core aims to use innovative methods, including the use
of novel and enhanced sampling and analytical methods. Core management and activities encourage
utilization of the EA Core in developing pilot projects and proposals and in executing research. The EA Core
provides free consultations, access to a broad menu of services, and “one-stop” shopping approach with the
goal of utilizing exposure measurements, enhancing research productivity, and promoting interdisciplinary work
for M-LEEaD members and others engaged in environmental health sciences research. Access to the EA Core
is available to M-LEEaD members, University of Michigan scientists, and other investigators. Cost-matching
and discounted fees for analytical services are available to M-LEEaD members, depending on analyte, matrix
and service. EA Core funds help support, as needed and feasible, methods development, statistical analyses,
exposure modeling and data interpretations, i.e., these items are not charged to Center members. EA Core
funds also help augment pilot projects, initiate and support method development and exploratory work, and
promote participation with collaborating and supporting laboratories for inter-laboratory inter-comparisons for
quality assurance and other purposes. Method development activities supporting exposure assessment
activities of Center members include advancing biomarker measurements, including the use of advanced
GC/MS-MS approaches, enhanced chemical detection and validation using archived dried blood spots
samples, combined genome/biomarker optimization; and exposure mapping."
10815575,"ABSTRACT (Pan Omics and Data Science Core)
The use of multi-omics techniques, including single-cell omics, in environmental health sciences (EHS)
research continues to grow rapidly, and the use of advanced machine learning and statistical learning
techniques to make translational predictions with these data is becoming ever more essential. As such,
staying on the cutting edge with these tasks can be overwhelming. The objective of the Pan Omics and Data
Science (PODS) Core is to provide comprehensive and innovative support to investigators in the Michigan
Center on Lifestage Environmental Exposures and Disease (M-LEEaD) for the study design, sample
preparation, analysis, interpretation, and integration of a broad range of omics-based studies, and to educate
them on available opportunities. The PODS Core streamlines the entire process of an omics study, allowing M-
LEEaD investigators to dedicate more of their own resources to answering difficult environmental health
science questions. Lifestage-specific exposures may have detrimental effects on human health via any of
several mechanisms, including epigenetic, genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metagenomic, metabolomic, and
adductomic. Thus, in the new funding period the PODS Core aims to broaden its reach both in terms of the
omics technologies supported, and the statistical and data science methods used. We will achieve this through
building a close-knit community of UM experts in these areas and interest/experience in EHS. The PODS Core
objective will be accomplished through four specific aims. First, we will provide M-LEEaD investigators
expertise in the study design and implementation of a broad range of molecular studies, including technology
platform choice, sample collection and preparation, and engagement with key UM resources. Second, we will
provide bioinformatics analysis and data science services for a broad range of omics approaches and
integrative analyses. Third, the PODS Core will support the community through development of novel
bioinformatics methods and tools and protocols for novel technologies staying apace with technological
advancements. Finally, the PODS Core educates M-LEEaD Center faculty, staff, and students on omics
assays and data science relevant to EHS research, and promotes partnerships between environmental
scientists and data scientists. M-LEEaD investigators benefit from several free services and collaborative
events offered by PODS, which enables and strengthens Fundamental Questions and also Application and
Synthesis in the NIEHS Translational Research Framework."

for shared facilities at UCSF via the Office of Research in the Chancellor's Office. This administrative structure
ensures that the EaRTH Center provides effective support and ensures the effectiveness and success of
environmental health research at UCSF."
10815578,"ABSTRACT (Community Engagement Core)
Consistent with the Michigan Center on Lifestage Environmental Exposures and Disease (M-LEEaD) theme,
Community Engagement Core (CEC) activities focus on linking environmental health priorities identified by
community members and decision makers with the expertise of Michigan Center on Lifestage Environmental
Exposures and Disease (M-LEEaD) researchers on environmental exposures over lifestages and their
implications for health. The overarching vision of the CEC is to increasing understanding among researchers of
community environmental health priorities to inform center research, expanding the use of environmental
health science in decision making, and promote scientific understanding of effective strategies to assure
multidirectional communication and effective engagement. We seek to foster multidirectional dialogue among
community members including youth, policy makers and public health decision-makers and Center researchers
to enhance awareness, understanding and the application of scientific knowledge about the role of
environmental exposures in disease through translation of community concerns to center scientists and
translation of findings to community member and decision makers. CEC activities focus on three primary
audiences: organizations and community leaders with capacity to reach residents in Southeast Michigan,
particularly Detroit; youth from communities experiencing disproportionate exposures and impacts,
representing the next generation of environmental health scientists, advocates and decision makers; and
current policy and public health decision makers in at the local, state and regional, levels. We will accomplish
our vision by: 1) enhancing, expanding, and sustaining partnerships with stakeholders; 2) facilitating
communication between communities experiencing excess risk, policy and public health decision makers, and
M-LEEaD researchers; 3) increasing access to environmental public health research among communities
experiencing excess health risk, policy makers and public health decision makers; and 4) advancing the field
of community engagement through evaluation of CEC process and outcomes, dissemination of results locally
and nationally, and promotion of participatory models for national implementation. CEC encompasses rigorous
evaluation methodology to further the science of participatory engagement and research translation. The
proposed vision and activities maintain and strengthen multidirectional dialogue across investigators with
expertise in physical and social environments and health with youth, adults and organizations representing
environmentally exposed communities, and policy and public health decision makers. This dialogue will inform
environmental health research across the lifestage and improve its translation to inform environmental health
interventions and policy decisions."
10815580,"ABSTRACT (Pilot Project Program)
The Pilot Project Program (PPP) contributes to the mission of the Michigan Center on Lifestage Environmental
Exposures and Disease (M-LEEaD) by supporting pilot projects that encourage innovation, creativity, and
multidisciplinary collaborations, especially among basic scientists, clinical researchers, and community and
regulatory stakeholders. The Pilot Project Program is an important mechanism for attracting new individuals to
our Center and for providing support to generate preliminary data to compete for external funding. The aims of
the Pilot Project Program are to: 1) attract established investigators new to our Center who can provide new
insights and approaches to questions regarding the relationships between lifestage environmental exposures
and disease; 2) encourage innovation, creativity, and multidisciplinary collaborations, especially between basic
scientists, clinical researchers, and community and regulatory stakeholders; 3) facilitate our Center members'
ability to respond quickly and effectively to new and quick-turnaround research opportunities, especially those
from NIEHS; and 4) provide important support for early-stage investigators to generate preliminary data for
developing independent research projects and compete for independent funding. This approach was
successful in the previous funding periods as evidenced by the number of junior faculty supported, the new
collaborations that were formed, the participation of scientists new to environmental health research that
participated in Center activities as a result of the Pilot Project Program, the number of external grant
applications submitted, the number of resulting publications, and career advancement, all as summarized in
the Research Strategy. Important advances in the administration of the Pilot Project Program during the last
cycle include: 1) the further advancement and refinement of a reviewer consortium with other P30 centers to
help improve objectivity of the reviews as well as avoid conflicts of interest that can result from reviews by
others in the same institution; 2) a modified scoring system and additional pilot funds to enhance community
engagement; and 3) a rapid response mechanism for funding exploratory work in high priority areas with a very
short turnaround time. In the next cycle of the Pilot Project Program, we will build on the momentum generated
in the current funding period by continuing the wide distribution of the Request for Applications throughout the
School of Public Health and the Medical School, continuing the reviewer consortium and continuing to promote
the use of our Core facilities. We will also continue our practice of including a CEC member on the review
committee responsible for ranking of the proposals to assure their input. Together, these practices will continue
the groundbreaking research developed in the initial cycles of the Pilot Project Program to advance a
comprehensive and integrated environmental health paradigm."
10815582,"ABSTRACT – COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE
 The Environmental Research and Translation for Health (EaRTH) Center Community Engagement Core
(CEC) will capitalize on growing recognition that environmental health is within the purview of healthcare and the
transformational changes in medical education taking place at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)
and beyond, to mainstream environmental health into the education and resources provided to our target
audience of graduate-level (nursing and doctoral level seeking, residents, and fellows) and practicing healthcare
professionals. The goal of the EaRTH Center CEC is to bridge health professionals and researchers so that
timely, environmental health research serves and protects public health. This “upstream” approach will provide
health professionals the knowledge and resources they need to understand and address their patients'
environmental health needs in the clinic while also creating a feedback loop permitting health professionals to
inform researchers about their environmental health questions, research needs, and clinical educational gaps.
To accomplish this, we will integrate environmental health science and its clinical application into the foundation
of learning that graduate-level and practicing healthcare professionals receive throughout their careers. If
students are to become effective healthcare professionals who protect and preserve patient and public health,
environmental health must be embedded into clinical education. Further, environmental health education and
resources must be provided to practicing healthcare professionals so they can better identify and prevent
upstream sources of exposures that lead to disease and communicate effectively with their patients. Our Specific
Aims are to: 1) Advance environmental health education within and beyond UCSF's graduate-level healthcare
professional programs and in health professional organizations; 2) Support in-depth training of future leaders in
environmental medicine by facilitating transdisciplinary learning among students, EaRTH Center members, and
the healthcare professional community; and 3) Advance environmental health literacy, communication, and
engagement of practicing health professionals by piloting and evaluating existing environmental health education
materials and clinical tools so that best practices may be identified; gaps may be addressed; and effective
materials and tools may ultimately be implemented at UCSF and throughout the nation. Our Center's location at
UCSF— ranked in the top five medical schools for science, training, and care —and our extensive track record
in this arena puts us in a unique and strong position to accomplish our goal. Through the CEC, we will create
healthcare professionals skilled in addressing and preventing environmental contributors to patient disease and
community health disparities and advance our effort to embed environmental health within healthcare."
10815586,"ABSTRACT – PILOT PROJECT PROGRAM 
 The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) Environmental Research and Translation for Health 
(EaRTH) Center offers the unique opportunity to support and grow an environmental health community at a 
premier multidisciplinary biomedical research institution with nearly 5,000 faculty members with expertise 
spanning basic, translational, clinical, and population arenas. Despite being the top NIH-funded public university, 
only 0.7% of NIH funding at UCSF currently comes from NIEHS. The EaRTH Center Pilot Project Program 
provides a mechanism to increase the amount of environmental health research at UCSF by tapping into the 
existing broad research base. By providing seed funds for exploratory studies, EaRTH Pilot Project awards will 
lower hurdles to initiating novel directions in environmental research and grow the pipeline of researchers and 
clinicians in environmental health. We will support the mission of the EaRTH Center by enabling cutting edge, 
exploratory research in areas directly related to environmental health. This goal is promoted by supporting basic, 
translational, epidemiological and clinical research projects through Core facilities as well as providing interaction 
with a community of researchers through the EaRTH Center. A Research Pilot Award will allow new or 
established faculty to rapidly transfer skills and developments from other research areas to the arena of 
environmental health research. A Mentored Scientist Award specifically for early-stage investigators will 
support innovative research projects and provide career and mentoring in environmental health research. A 
Mentored Clinician Award, administered jointly with the Community Engagement Core (CEC), for clinicians will 
provide dedicated time for a clinician to gain experience in environmental health. The Pilot Project Program will 
stimulate research that fills gaps in the area of environmental health in development and preconception at UCSF. 
To streamline the application process and to capture the largest number of high quality applications with 
innovative projects proposed from researchers outside of environmental health, we will conduct the RFA through 
the broadly used UCSF Resource Allocation Program (RAP). Evaluation metrics will be applied to the pilot 
projects to assess and promote success of projects and the overall program. The UCSF EaRTH Center 
engagement with the entire UCSF scientific community will enable discussions of the application of 
interdisciplinary approaches to environmental health research. This ensures our pilot grant recipients have full 
access to local expertise, which assists their entry into, and staying power in, environmental health-related areas."
10818974,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a devastating disease that continues to have a poor prognosis with less than
one-third of patients achieving a cure from their disease. While the identification of genomic subtypes has
enabled some risk stratification, it is increasingly evident that variation in cell states in AML and particularly the
presence of leukemia progenitors that co-opt hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) programs appear to confer a
particularly poor prognosis. Despite these robust descriptive observations, however, the molecular drivers of
these high-risk gene expression programs that alter cell state have remained largely undefined. Our research
group recently characterized a gene network that is regulated by the HSC master transcription factor MECOM
and co-opted in high-risk forms of AML. However, we still lack an understanding of the mechanisms by which
MECOM regulates this network and how it can be therapeutically hijacked to improve treatment of leukemias.
To better interrogate MECOM’s direct function in AML, we engineered an AML cell-line model in which MECOM
can be rapidly and controllably degraded by addition of a small molecule. Assessments of changes in
transcription and chromatin accessibility immediately following complete MECOM degradation implicate
MECOM as an epigenetic repressor of a pro-myeloid differentiation program. Importantly, the majority of these
differentially accessible chromatin regions are also directly bound by MECOM in the absence of degradation,
suggesting that these observed changes are a direct consequence of MECOM ablation. The observed repressive
function of MECOM is also consistent with its reported interactions with the CtBP family of co-repressive factors.
However, there are fundamental knowledge gaps both in the identity of MECOM’s direct targets across primary
AMLs and the mechanisms underlying its repressive function, both of which could be therapeutically useful. This
study consists of two aims to investigate: (1) the identity of genetic targets directly regulated by MECOM function
in high-risk AMLs, and (2) the epigenetic mechanisms by which MECOM represses differentiation programs to
maintain AML progenitor cells. For this F31 award, the PI has designed a research strategy and training program
that will provide him with: (1) fundamental expertise in genomics, bioinformatics, and cancer biology, (2) an
expert group of mentors and collaborators to promote not only research expertise, but also career-long academic
skills including grantsmanship and scientific communication, and (3) experience performing rigorous,
mechanistic and foundational biomedical research in preparation for his career goal as an academic scientist.
This proposal will take place in the rich and collaborative Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital
research environments. Completion of this work is expected to identify the direct transcriptional targets of
MECOM in high-risk AML and elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms by which MECOM drives leukemogenesis.
These results will have profound implications for the rationale pursuit of high-confidence, tractable targets that
can be therapeutically manipulated for the treatment of myeloid malignancies currently with dismal outcomes."
10821393,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Each tumor faces a common set of obstacles arising from tumor-intrinsic dynamics, microenvironment signals
and therapeutic interventions. The “canonical” view of tumorigenesis is a landscape within which each tumor
navigates a unique path by combining various tactics to overcome these obstacles. A number of the early
breakthroughs in cancer treatment directly resulted from coarse demarcations of these paths into distinct
subtypes based on “genomic landmarks” such as the BCR-ABL fusion in chronic myeloid leukemia. However,
in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the majority of patients lack actionable mutations and nearly half of AML
patients present with normal karyotype. For certain AML driver mutations, molecularly targeted drugs have
shown initial clinical promise but not long-term durability; resistance remains a key challenge for targeted
therapies, prompting a shift to combination strategies. Intratumor heterogeneity and plasticity as well as the
tumor microenvironment play a fundamental role in shaping response to therapy and development of
resistance. Recent findings indicate that targeted agents have different efficacies on AML cells at distinct
stages of myeloid differentiation and lead to different resistance mechanisms. This observation opens the
potential to improve clinical utility by matching targeted drugs to cell phenotypes. A specific, yet clinically
important case of this observation is the different efficacies of targeted BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax and MEK
inhibitors in AML cells at distinct stages of myeloid differentiation. In our preliminary analysis of the Beat AML
cohort, we observe a concordance between this phenotype and the downstream transcriptional impact of BCL2
and MCL1 proteins suggesting a molecular link to a previously described venetoclax resistance mechanism.
We hypothesize that differentiation-state plasticity is a general modulator of short-term resistance to a wide
range of targeted compounds. A mechanistic understanding of cell differentiation-state plasticity in conjunction
with genome-driven cellular processes can improve stratification of patients to therapies and suggest more
tailored combinatorial treatments. To that end, I will use the largest assembled dataset of matched multi-omic
assembled profiles, drug screens, and clinical information for primary leukemia samples from the Beat AML
project at the Knight Cancer Institute. My objective is to perform systematic analysis of bulk genomic,
functional ex-vivo assays (drug and CRISPR), conjointly with single-cell transcriptomic, ex-vivo CyTOF and
single-cell drug response data in AML primary samples to understand the effects of tumor heterogeneity and
plasticity on drug response at an unprecedented detail. The anticipated outcomes are 1) improved patient
outcomes achieved by accurately matching therapies to individual patients and 2) nomination of new
approaches to mitigate plasticity-based drug resistance."
10823666,"Project Summary
The specific objective of the Clinical Core is to provide human specimens for the studies outlined in Research
Projects (RP) 1-3. These human specimens will supplement the existing extensive collection of unique banked
specimens that are future-use consented and which will be available for use in RP1-3. These specimens include
specimens from unique immunization and/or challenge studies conducted at Maryland, against S. Typhi, Non-
Typhoidal Salmonella, and Shigella species. Of particular note, as specified in RFA-AI-22-069, support is
requested to obtain additional human specimens only from clinical studies involving subjects who are receiving
licensed vaccines. Blood and duodenal and/or terminal ileum biopsies, from subjects undergoing medically
indicated endoscopy who consent to receive the Ty21a oral typhoid vaccine, will be collected under Protocol
CVD 38000. Blood will also be collected from un-vaccinated controls (Blood Donor CVD 4000) and Ty21a
vaccinated individuals (Blood Donor CVD 5000). The Clinical Core will provide the infrastructure to collect these
unique human clinical specimens, which will supplement the already extensive existing specimen bank. The
leadership of the clinical core are composed of two experienced physician-scientists who also provide patient
care within the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC) or as part of the Faculty Practice Office of the
University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM). The clinical core is also staffed by experienced nurse s
that have been trained in GCP and are well acquainted with the research protocols to be utilized for our studies.
The resources being made available through the clinical core and the patient volumes (clinical activity) of the
involved clinics should ensure that sufficient human specimens will be provided for the in-depth immunological
studies proposed in this CCHI application."
10823668,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Core 3: Imaging Mass Cytometry Core
The overall goal of the proposed CCHI U19 grant is to determine the mechanisms of mucosal immune responses
to human-restricted enteric pathogens, S. typhi and Shigella, which to date remain significant global
health concerns. To determine the limitations of current vaccine approaches and immune protection, we need
to better understand the immunologic changes and the mechanisms thereof that are occurring systemically
and locally within the gut mucosa. Leveraging our CCHI U19 team’s longstanding expertise in and
unparalleled clinical infrastructure for evaluating the immune responses to these enteric pathogens, our
proposed center seeks to understand the changes within major immune compartments, including T cells, B
cells, and innate cells, upon clinical vaccinations and/or pathogen challenge. To accomplish this, we
propose to phenotype the different immune cell subtypes and their functional states in-depth at the
molecular level and interrogate how they are epigenetically regulated. Furthermore, to determine how the
immune responses are orchestrated in situ within the mucosa, we propose to determine the spatial
coordination among the immune cells in human mucosal biopsy samples and integrate this information with
other molecular features. To enable synergy across all Research Projects, the Imaging Mass Cytometry
Core will operate as a centralized service core, providing an imaging pipeline to be implemented on all
biospecimens. The overarching purpose of the Imaging Mass Cytometry Core is, therefore, to generate high-
parameter (30-40+ markers) spatial immune profiles with subcellular resolution for all three Research
Projects. The Core will support the Research Project investigators with the expertise necessary to most
optimally utilize imaging mass cytometry techniques. We established an efficient workflow to receive mucosal
biopsy samples from University of Maryland and process them for imaging mass cytometry at Johns Hopkins.
This Core will deliver the following: Aim 1, optimized and validated antibody panels suited for each Research
Project along with the resulting multicolored quality-controlled images; and Aim 2, segmented single-cell data
from the acquired images for compositional and neighbor/distance-based spatial analyses. The Core’s
leadership and staff have demonstrated a strong track record of employing imaging mass cytometry to
advance immunology studies, ensuring success of the proposed aims. The incorporation of our Core’s spatial
analysis expertise will uniquely enhance the efforts of the proposed CCHI U19 to understand the immunologic
barriers to effective protection and ultimately motivate new strategies for improved vaccine development."

10823359,"Background. This is a Type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial studying the role of a community- based,
childcare center-support system in improving resilience and mitigating the long-term impacts of the pandemic on
child development. Public health disasters have disproportionate and long-term impacts on poor, disenfranchised
communities. Miami-Dade County has one of the US's highest rates of chronic poverty, is minority majority, and
has been an epicenter of the pandemic. COVID-19 is having psychosocial impacts on children that is producing
anxiety, irritability, anger, and depression. Teachers in childcare centers continue to be overwhelmed by
changing guidelines and how to address the downstream psychological effects children are experiencing. While
numerous resources exist that can help childcare centers with disaster recovery, the information can be
overwhelming and difficult to navigate, and research is yet to show the actual benefits of the resources.
Approach. We will leverage our existing community-based intervention, Jump Start, with its extensive reach in
Miami-Dade County, to childcare centers participating in the County’s Quality Improvement System. This system
prioritizes children living in poverty who are at highest risk for problems. This study will be modeled on a
successful Early Childhood Mental Health Consultation (ECMHC) intervention which utilizes mental health
consultants to deliver a Jump Start+: COVID Support virtual toolkit to childcare centers via a Kubi robot. The
toolkit is comprised of four strength-based strategies likely to be effective in improving resiliency following
disasters: Safety Planning, Effective Communication, Adult Self-Care, and Trauma-Informed Behavior Support.
We will use Reach, Effectiveness-Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to guide the
evaluation of our Type 1 hybrid design. Our first aim will utilize a cluster randomized trial to examine the
effectiveness of Jump Start+: COVID Support on improving the psychosocial functioning of young children, as
compared to an obesity-prevention intervention control group. Child development is the primary outcome, with
children followed at 6, 12,18, and 24 months. The second aim will examine the mechanisms that contribute to
effective teachers’ uptake of Jump Start+: COVID Support strategies on child outcomes. The third aim will
explore implementation barriers/facilitators as well as potential societal contextual factors (e.g., vaccine uptake)
to help centers serving disproportionately affected minority communities recover from and prepare for future
crises. Impact. These aims meet a high-priority research area for NICHD because they address the social and
environmental factors that can enhance children’s resilience. Employing a Type 1 hybrid design will inform the
refinement and scaling of Jump Start+: COVID Support and generalize impacts to other childcare center
interventions in the context of disasters. We have the potential to influence long-term trajectories of childcare
center practices and child development which, in turn, can chart a course for future child health and well-being
in the face of crises."

seeks to delineate the mechanisms and functional consequences of cortical areal specification.
 Different areas of the human brain give rise to unique cognitive abilities. For example, expansion of the
lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) in humans is thought to underlie higher-order cognitive processes such as
decision-making, planning and working memory. Recent data has implicated retinoic acid (RA), a derivative of
vitamin A, as a key player in the early development of the PFC in humans; however, the precise mechanism by
which RA specifies PFC identities is unknown. This proposal leverages a human induced pluripotent stem cell–
derived cerebral organoid model, which recapitulates many aspects of early human brain development, to test
the hypothesis that RA acts in a cell type–specific manner to specify PFC identities. Using this model, Dr.
Cadwell proposes to 1) identify the nuclear receptors and gene regulatory elements that mediate RA signaling
in human cortical progenitors and 2) determine whether PFC-like areal fate is stable after RA induction. This
work will generate fundamental knowledge about the role of RA in patterning the cerebral cortex, and may
provide insights into neurodevelopmental disorders associated abnormal cortical areal specification.
 The proposed career development plan includes training in cerebral organoid models, epigenetic
techniques and analysis of large-scale data sets. Dr. Cadwell will learn all of the skills needed for an
independent research career, including supervising trainees and staff, grant writing, and scientific
communication. She has assembled a world-class mentorship team with complementary expertise in
organoids and human brain development (Primary mentor, Dr. Tomasz Nowakowski), molecular mechanisms
of cortical development and patterning (Co-mentor Dr. John Rubenstein and Advisory Committee Member Dr.
Sam Pleasure), gene regulation (Advisory Committee Member Dr. Nadav Ahituv), analysis of large-scale
genomic data (Dr. Katie Pollard), and neuropathology of neurodevelopmental disorders (Dr. Eric Huang). Dr.
Cadwell, her mentors, and the Department of Pathology at UCSF are fully committed to this proposal and to
her goal of becoming an independent physician-neuroscientist by the completion of this training period."
10820784,"Stroke is one of the most common causes of long-term disability. About 60% of stroke survivors have
impaired leg movement, leading to reduced walking speed and quality of life. One contributor to leg impairment
appears to be abnormal co-activation of leg muscles, especially hip adductors and knee extensors. This is similar
to the abnormal co-activation (a.k.a. abnormal synergies) that contributes to impaired arm movement after
stroke. We have developed a Myoelectric Interface for NeurorehabiliTation (MINT) paradigm to counteract
abnormal co-activation. Our prior work and preliminary results have shown that MINT conditioning to reduce co-
activation can improve arm movement even in chronic stroke survivors, and that an early wearable version had
relatively high adherence and enjoyment. The long-term goal of this research is to develop an inexpensive,
robust, wearable device for home-based MINT conditioning and translate it into clinical use for improving
movement in both arm and leg. The objectives of this proposal are 1) to build robust, completely wireless EMG
sensors and more engaging games to enable user-friendly, home-based therapy, 2) to test MINT conditioning’s
ability to reduce leg muscle co-activation and improve gait in chronic stroke survivors, and 3) to determine the
mechanisms behind the response to MINT conditioning. Our preliminary results show that MINT conditioning
can be used in the leg and can improve gait kinematics and walking speed, a key goal of locomotor recovery.
We hypothesize that MINT conditioning will improve leg function and walking in stroke survivors. We will achieve
our objectives via the following specific aims: 1) develop a robust MINT system using wireless electrodes and
more engaging games; 2) test the impact of MINT conditioning on leg movement; and 3) investigate mechanisms
of changes from MINT conditioning. This proposal’s innovative combination of inexpensive, completely wireless,
wearable devices and engaging, commercial-quality games will improve robustness and enhance translational
potential. Achieving our objectives will be significant because it will establish that abnormal co-activation of hip
adductors and knee extensors impairs gait. It will also facilitate the development of an enhanced, rehabilitative
therapy to improve function after stroke that could be used widely and potentially could help severely impaired
stroke survivors. The enhanced therapy will increase enjoyment and enable use in any location, both of which
are critical to increasing the dose of, and engagement with, therapy, which in turn increase the likelihood of
recovery. We expect that MINT conditioning will be synergistic with existing therapies, given its novel mechanism
of action (reducing abnormal co-activation using myoelectric signals). The research will also provide fundamental
understanding of the mechanism of improvement due to MINT conditioning—specifically, where in the CNS
changes occur due to rehabilitation after a stroke. Finally, this project will provide critical results that will enable
us to quickly translate this research into pivotal clinical trials."
10821725,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide, and accounts for 13%
of global deaths and 370,000 deaths annually in the US. Accumulating evidence suggests exposure to inorganic
arsenic (As) and other (often co-occurring) toxic metals may be an independent risk factor for CHD. Although
most individuals are simultaneously exposed to different metals, most studies focused on the toxicity of individual
metals. Combinations of exposures may have different, and possibly stronger, effects than each exposure
separately. However, there were no large epidemiologic studies on either the effects of metal mixtures (specific
combinations of metals) or metal–metal interactions on CHD risk. Moreover, the inadequacy of data on genetic
susceptibility masks the effects of environmental exposures. Conversely, genetic studies often ignore that effects
of genetic factors on CHD are modulated by varying levels of environmental factors. Data on gene–metal
interactions can identify population subgroups with much higher disease risks. However, the few studies focused
on gene–metal interactions in CHD had limited sample sizes (n = ~200), tested a single exposure only,
considered only <200 genetic variants in <20 genes, and included homogenous study populations with a limited
range of exposure to assess full dose–response relationship. Several genome-wide interaction studies (GWIS)
on cardiovascular traits identified genetic markers not previously reported by genome-wide association studies.
However, no GWIS has investigated gene–metal interactions in CHD. While studies on gene–metal interactions
are critical to provide insights into disease biology, metabolomics—the systematic analysis of low molecular
weight metabolites in response to external exposures—offers another approach to elucidate mechanisms by
which metal mixtures may lead to CHD. However, no studies investigated the interplay of metal mixtures and
metabolomics profiles in CHD risk. We propose to: 1) evaluate the roles of metals and metal mixtures in CHD
risk; 2) assess genetic susceptibility to the effects of metals and metal mixtures on the risk of CHD; and 3) identify
the potential urinary metabolites associated with both CHD risk and metals/metal mixtures. We will leverage data
and samples from three prospective cohorts—the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS), the
Strong Heart Family Study (SHFS), and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA)—that include diverse
adult populations. We anticipate our results will show that metal mixtures and genetic susceptibility both
contribute to CHD risk . They may also increase knowledge of potential underlying mechanisms (altered urinary
metabolites or genetic pathways) by which metals and metal mixtures promote CHD. Supporting studies of
combined exposures or mixtures is one of the goals of the NIEHS Strategic Plan 2018–2023 to advance
environmental health sciences. This project will address an important public health issue and clinical topic with
the potential to provide evidence on the biological mechanism of metal mixture toxicity on CHD development
and can improve clinical understanding for prevention and controlling exposures in the US and abroad."
10822215,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Environmental lung diseases are preventable disorders caused or made worse by adverse, inhaled exposures
to inflammation-inducing aerosolized agents such as endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide/LPS) and microbial
component-enriched organic dust. Every situation along the exposure continuum from long-term, low-level
exposure to one-time, high-dose exposure can cause lung injury and subsequent disease. Anthropogenic climate
change and associated industrial and agricultural intensification synergistically elevate worker and non-worker
risk of adverse respiratory health outcomes. Environmental inhaled exposures can cause significant lung and
airway inflammatory diseases including asthma, chronic bronchitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). Despite advances in understanding the key inflammatory signaling pathways
involved in initiating the lung inflammatory response, there remains a paucity of knowledge and efficacious
therapeutic options to hasten recovery and halt progression towards a chronic disease state. Our recent studies
strikingly demonstrate environmental exposure-induced recruitment and activation of distinct lung monocyte-
macrophage subpopulations involved in disease pathogenesis. Additionally, our bulk RNA sequencing, single
cell (sc) RNA sequencing, and monocyte/macrophage subpopulation-specific transcriptomic analyses of lung
homogenate harvested from mice given inhaled environmental exposures robustly implicate the aconitate
decarboxylase 1 (ACOD1)-itaconate immunometabolic pathway as a potential central regulator. The proposed
studies herein will be the first to investigate environmental exposure-induced lung disease through an
immunometabolic lens. To this end, I hypothesize that the ACOD1-itaconate axis operates as a critical, negative
regulator of lung monocyte/macrophage inflammatory processes in environmental exposure-induced lung injury
and inflammation. In Specific Aim 1, I will determine the functional effect of ACOD1-itaconate pathway induction
and modulation on human monocyte-derived macrophage differentiation and effector responses amidst
environmental inflammatory exposures. In Specific Aim 2, the role of the ACOD1 signaling pathway in mediating
lung inflammatory, resolving, and functional processes will be assessed in ACOD1 deficient mice exposed to
inhaled, environmental inflammatory agents. Additionally, I will determine the therapeutic potential of lung-
targeted, exogenous itaconate administration in hastening recovery following inhaled environmental exposure.
The results of these studies will have an important positive impact by establishing the pre-clinical groundwork
for understanding the ACOD1-itaconate axis in the context of environmental exposure-induced lung disease.
Completion of these aims will optimally inform the development of novel therapies capable of preventing
irreversible lung disease post-environmental exposure."

There is a crisis of reproducibility and replicability of scientiﬁc results. This crisis is an increasing source of
concern both in the scientiﬁc and popular press. The crisis is so acute that the United States Congress is currently
investigating reproducibility of the scientiﬁc process. At the heart of this crisis is a collection of problems including
small-sample sizes, under-powered studies, under-trained data analysts and an inability to directly leverage prior
results in the statistical analysis of smaller, hypothesis-driven experiments using high-throughput technologies.
Advances in technology have dramatically reduced the cost and diﬃculty of collecting high-throughput molecular
data. Large collections of raw data are increasingly publicly available but are usually incorporated into individual
analyses by NIGMS and other investigators on an ad-hoc basis. Meanwhile, the other costs of running a designed,
hypothesis-driven study have not decreased at the same speed with technological advances. It is still expensive to
identify, recruit, collect, and follow up samples even if the high-throughput measurements themselves are cheap.
Despite the incredible amount of available public data, it is still common practice to perform statistical inference
in these hypothesis-driven experiments study-by-study, only indirectly including previous data, estimates, and
results. So ﬁndings from these studies may be highly variable, unreliable, or unreplicable. Our group has focused
on developing statistical methods, data resources, and software and training that allow researchers to borrow
strength empirically from public repositories, large-scale data generation projects, and crowd-sourced data to
improve inference in individual, hypothesis driven studies. We propose to build on our work in developing
statistical data sources, methods, software and training that facilitate and speed the work of our biological and
medical collaborators. The result will be a research community that can take advantage of public data already
collected at a large cost to the NIH to improve power, reduce required sample sizes, and improve replication in
many new hypothesis driven molecular studies of development and disorder."

The goal of this application is to provide the infrastructure to support The Ohio State University's (OSU)
participation in the scientific and clinical research activities of the NCI's NCTN Program as a Network Lead
Academic Participating Site (OSU-LAPS). Faculty from OSU are integrated into the scientific and administrative
activities, participate in meetings, manage multiple core labs, design studies and enroll patients in all existing
adult NCTN network groups using OSU Comprehensive Cancer Center (OSUCCC) resources to leverage group
resources. OSUCCC investigators develop and lead studies designed to enroll patients on multi-disciplinary
treatment trials as well as develop and perform correlative science related research studies, bringing special
expertise in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Our medical, hematologic, surgical and radiation
oncologists, transplanters, psychiatrists, pathologists, cytogeneticists, translational and basic laboratory
scientists, statisticians, epidemiologists, nurses, pharmacists, and clinical research coordinators help to frame
the clinical and basic science questions whose answers contribute to improved patient outcomes and to
understanding tumor biology. OSU-LAPS will offer innovative NCI trials to the OSU patient population, support
scientific discoveries about tumor biology, find better treatments, and augment the quality of life for patients thus
improving outcomes across the spectrum of cancers affecting adults. This comprehensive program aims to: 1)
investigate new therapeutic agents, and their toxicities in Phase I to III NCI clinical trials; 2) evaluate the efficacy
and toxicity of novel combinations based on preclinical data to exploit synergistic combinations more effectively;
3) develop multi-modal approaches using surgical, immunological, and radiotherapeutic therapies in optimal
combinations; 4) integrate experts in molecular genetics, biochemistry, pharmacology, immunology, and
biostatistics in the design and execution of therapeutic protocols; 5) improve cancer outcomes through discovery
and education of pre and post-doctoral students, nurses, allied medical personnel and physicians, 6) understand
and exploit tumor heterogeneity to fully exploit the value of targeted therapies, 7) improve the management of
cancer related symptoms, 8) form the next generation of clinical investigators by offering them formal teaching
and mentoring within the NCTN, and 9) enroll volunteering patients on trials."
10794399,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pediatric solid tumors are a rare and highly heterogeneous collection of cancers. For many subtypes, progress
in defining novel therapies has stalled over the last 10-20 years. Indeed, for most of these tumors
chemotherapy continues to be the primary form of treatment and targeted therapies are not available. This
lack of progress is likely due at least in part to the difficulty in developing clinical trials for individual histologic
subtypes given their rarity. An alternative is to develop a robust preclinical testing program. Currently, such
programs are limited by the lack of well-credentialed models that incorporate the most advanced technologies
for genomic and functional characterization and do to the lack of good models for therapy-resistant and
metastatic disease. Here we bring together two PIs with complimentary expertise to develop new approaches
for validation and preclinical use of pediatric solid tumor animal models. Our focus is on the use of patient-
derived xenografts for three most common histotypes: osteosarcoma, ewing sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma.
PDX models are particularly well suited for studying highly heterogeneous tumors such as pediatric solid
tumors. In Aim 1, we will develop novel advance PDX models that incorporate two key innovations: i) utilization
of CRISPR/CAS9 technology for genetic interrogation and ii) autologous and allogeneic approaches for
development of PDX models with a human immune system (hu-PDX). In Aim 2, we will develop novel
computational tools to assess the similarity of PDX models to their tumor of origin and to evaluate human-
mouse and mouse-mouse evolution which may impact clinical relevance. We will work closely with members of
the Oncology Models Forum to develop scoring systems to assess this similarity and make these tools widely
available to the modeling community. In Aim 3, we will evaluate intratumor heterogeneity during human-mouse
and mouse-mouse evolution of PDX models using single cell RNAseq. We expect that the tools and models
developed here will be widely applicable to other PDX models and that the specific models we develop will
help facilitate preclinical research. We will make all tools and models widely accessible to the research
community."
10794406,"The proposed project goal is to determine which validated bipolar disorder instrument is most
acceptable and helpful to patients and clinicians in clinical care, demonstrate that the preferred
instrument can be used to monitor outcomes with high fidelity in routine care, and assess the feasibility
of comparing effectiveness of measurement-based care (MBC) to usual care in a randomized trial.
Many individuals with bipolar disorder experience fluctuating depressive and manic symptoms which
can impair functioning and reduce quality of life. Measurement based care (MBC) is an emerging best
practice involving serial assessment of clinical status and using those findings to inform clinical decision
making. When implemented with fidelity, MBC helps clinicians adjust treatment to “treat to target”.
However, no studies have determined preferred bipolar disorder measures for use in clinical care.
Furthermore, adoption of MBC for individuals with bipolar disorder has had especially low uptake in
routine care. The lack of consensus about which measure to use in serial assessment of bipolar
disorder clinical status is likely due to the difficulty of assessing clinical status for patients with bipolar
disorder. There are multiple ways to measure clinical status including measuring functioning or
symptoms, and when measuring symptoms, there is a need to measure changes in both depressive
and manic symptoms. Specifically, there may be uncertainty about how to interpret symptom scale
results with respect to weighing the importance of depression and manic symptom severity (particularly
when they vary in opposite directions between time points). There is a need to determine the optimal
measure for use in MBC for individuals with bipolar disorder. Aims of this R34 include: 1) Using
qualitative methods, obtain input from people with bipolar disorder to choose the preferred instrument
for monitoring bipolar disorder clinical status that is acceptable, helpful, and understandable in
informing when to change treatment. In Aim 1 we expect to identify an Identify an MBC instrument that
is perceived to be acceptable, helpful, and understandable to patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Next, in Aim 2) In a single arm open trial, assess the feasibility of MBC with the preferred instrument for
bipolar disorder and assess fidelity to the protocol including instrument administration, scoring, and
reviewing results. In Aim 2 we expect to achieve high fidelity to the MBC protocol. In Aim 3) Conduct a
randomized pragmatic pilot effectiveness trial comparing the MBC with the preferred instrument for
bipolar disorder to usual care. We will test the Aim 3 hypothesis that treatment adjustments will occur
more often in the MBC group than the usual care group, and the exploratory hypothesis that symptoms
of bipolar disorder will decrease more in the MBC group than the usual care group. These findings will
support an R01 application to conduct a definitive randomized trial."

Our recently completed R01 suggested that processing speed and attention (PS/A) oriented cognitive training
(VSOP) produced robust effect on PS/A and working memory, but not in cognitive control or episodic memory,
and long-term effects were overall modest. In the proposed R01 renewal, we propose to identify additional
attributes to further enhance transferred and long-term effects of PS/A training in older adults with amnestic mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) by addressing adaptation capacity that underpins adaptive learning and
neuroplasticity. The goal of the stage II double-blinded randomized trial is to test whether adding resonance
frequency breathing (RFB) training to VSOP will strengthen multiple contributors to adaptation capacity,
particularly the central and peripheral pathways of autonomic nervous system (ANS) flexibility, which will
strengthen VSOP training effect on cognitive and brain function and slow the progress of dementia in MCI. Our
central hypothesis is that strengthening adaptation capacity, via improving autonomic nervous system (ANS)
flexibility, will enhance neuroplasticity and slow progress of dementia in MCI, since adaptation capacity is critical
for neuroplasticity of VSOP, but compromised in neurodegenerative process. Older adults with MCI (n = 114)
will be randomly assigned to an 8-week combined intervention (RFB+VSOP), VSOP with guided imagery
relaxation (IR) control, and a waitlist IR control, with periodical booster training sessions at follow-ups.
Mechanistic and distal outcomes include ANS flexibility and multiple markers of dementia progress. Data will be
collected across a 14-month period. The two primary aims are to examine long-term effects of the combined
intervention on ANS flexibility (Aim 1), as well as the cognitive, behavioral, and functional capacity (Aim 2). The
exploratory aim will be to determine the preliminary long-term effect of the combined intervention on
neurodegeneration. We consider this a reasonable renewal plan from our completed R01, aiming to identify
additional attributes to further enhance transferred and long-term effects of cognitive training in MCI. This will be
among the first RCTs to examine a novel, combined intervention targeting adaptation capacity in MCI, with an
ultimate goal for slowing neurodegeneration. The proposed work is aligned with NINR strategic plan to advance
nursing science, eps. symptoms management (in this case, improving cognitive and functional symptoms in MCI)
using a non-pharmacological intervention approach and understanding relevant mechanisms."
10794221,"The number of underrepresented minorities (URM) receiving graduate training in the biological and
physical sciences continues to be small despite increases in the total population. Major obstacles for URMs
applying to and being admitted to graduate programs in the biomedical sciences include limited research
experience, limited advanced courses in the life sciences, unfamiliarity with the application process, and
unawareness of career opportunities for PhD's. Recognizing these issues and the need to increasing the
diversity of its own doctoral programs and faculty as well as the field as a whole, Harvard's Graduate School of
Arts and Sciences initiated a formal post-baccalaureate pilot program in the life sciences called the Research
Scholar Initiative (RSI) in 2012 and through funding from NIGMS, improved and expanded the pilot program
through establishment of a Post-baccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) in 2016 which we call
(RSI PREP). 17 RSI PREPScholars have completed the program with 82% entering PhD programs. While the
program has been successful in achieving many of the goals, early evaluation of the program, has
identified some areas of improvement. RSI PREP will provide a 1-2 year research and educational
training opportunity for individuals interested in pursuing PhDs in the biomedical sciences. The goals
are to 1) provide a personalized research education and training opportunity for 8 scholars/yr with at least 90%
completing at least one year of the program; 2) have a minimum of 85% apply to and be admitted to PhD
programs or in some cases, MD/PhD programs in the biomedical sciences; 3) increase trainees preparation
and comfort with academic and research skills important for success in PhD programs; 4) have a minimum of
85% of trainees that enter PhD programs complete the PhD; 5) institutional impact via increasing the diversity
of our PhD and MD-PhD programs and continuing to change faculty perceptions.
 Goals will be achieved by 1) RSI PREP Scholars doing independent research with faculty in the Life
Sciences at for one year and possibly two years; 2) developing a personalized program to enhance academic
preparation (e.g., quantitative methods, cell biology, computing, writing , etc.,); 3) Establishing an advisory
committee for each scholar to expand their mentoring network; 4) Having Scholars participate in a program-
specific course and workshops designed to build skills critical for graduate school success; and 5) Familiarize
scholars with a graduate training environment by providing opportunities to interact with current students and
faculty in our program and other programs in the area; 6) providing faculty with the opportunity to engage with

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability in adults, with a substantial fiscal impact. Furthermore,
patellofemoral joint OA is a major source of pain and dysfunction. A hypothetical model for OA pathogenesis has
been proposed whereby repetitive joint loading causes an initial increase in bone remodeling, which is associated
with increased vascular invasion of the deep layers of cartilage. Emerging Proton Emission Tomography and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging simultaneous systems (PET-MRI) offer an exciting new modality to simultaneously
acquire numerous functional measures as well as high-resolution morphology to study this complex
phenomenon. Joint loading is integral to OA progression yet currently, very little is known regarding the
biomechanical factors associated with PFJOA progression. Therefore, our overall goal is to: (i) identify cross-
sectional and longitudinal local patterns of cartilage and bone interactions unique to PFJOA, and (ii) determine
the mediation effects of gait biomechanics and bone morphology on PFJOA progression. We will conduct a
longitudinal cohort study investigating 100 people with isolated PFJOA, followed for 2 time points. Simultaneous
PET-MRI and gait biomechanics will be collected for all subjects at baseline and 2-year follow-up. Aim 1: To
study the cross-sectional relationships between bone and cartilage imaging biomarkers and to
investigate how the patterns of interactions are mediated by gait biomechanics and bone morphology.
Hypothesis 1: Elevated SUV in subjects with PFJOA will be colocalized with prolongation of T1ρ and T2 relaxation
times. Complex bone-cartilage interactions mediated by change in loading as a result of abnormal gait
biomechanics and bone morphology will show non-colocalized associations between bone and cartilage.
Aim 2: To study the longitudinal relationships between bone and cartilage imaging biomarkers and to
investigate how the patterns of interactions are mediated by gait biomechanics and morphology:
Hypothesis 2: Early changes in bone metabolic activity (SUV) are a precursor to cartilage compositional changes
(T1ρ and T2). Subjects with specific abnormal gait biomechanics and bone shape features will show accelerated
compositional changes. Aim 3: To determine the ability of bone-cartilage interactions to predict
longitudinal trajectories of structural and symptomatic PFJOA progression. Hypothesis 3: Both colocalized
and non-colocalized bone-cartilage interaction patterns mediated by joint biomechanics and bone shape will be
significant predictors of structural and symptomatic PJOA progression. Cross-sectional and longitudinal
evaluations of cartilage composition and bone remodeling mediated by gait biomechanics as likely contributors
to PFJOA progression, are vital to determine the individual and combined effects of the disease."

10794285,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neonatal quality improvement efforts are rightly credited with improving patient safety outcomes yet infants in
neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) continue to experience preventable harm. A primary mechanism
responsible for improved outcomes is the high degree of process reliability with which routine care processes –
especially those of nurses – must be completed. Studies from our team and others show that NICU nurses
regularly miss essential care linked to neonatal safety outcomes and that a primary contributor to nurses’ low
care reliability is high workload. Nurse workload is often operationalized as objective measures of nursing
resource intensity using patient-to-nurse staffing ratios and/or patient acuity metrics. However, objective
measures do not capture important experiential aspects of nurse workload that likely influence reliability such
as cognitive demands and time pressure. Our prior research found that NICU nurses’ subjective workload was
more strongly and consistently associated with care reliability than either staffing ratio or infant acuity,
suggesting that direct effects of ratios on care reliability may be overestimated. Further, routine monitoring of
subjective workload in NICUs may be an important new strategy for addressing variation in care reliability. Our
prior research was conducted in a single level IV NICU with high nursing resources compared to benchmarking
units, limiting generalizability. We propose to evaluate relationships between nurse workload and care
reliability in a larger, more diverse sample of NICUs, nurses, and infants. Using an intensive longitudinal
design, we will enroll up to 210 nurses in 5 NICUs to report on workload and care reliability for approximately
820 infants over the course of 1,120 shifts. We aim to: 1) evaluate differential effects of objective and
subjective nurse workload on care reliability in NICUs; 2) examine relationships between shift-level situational
factors and nurses’ subjective workload ratings; and 3) evaluate the validity of aggregating nurses’ subjective
workload ratings within a shift to inform real-time measurement strategies. The proposed study directly
responds to NICHD PA-18-790 to “study the effects of physician and nurse workload on performance and
patient safety” in neonatal environments. Specifically, we focus on relationships between workload and safety-
related performance, with implications for outcomes that we will test in a subsequent study. This project will
advance patient safety by broadening current understanding of nurse workload and its effects on care reliability
beyond staffing ratios and infant acuity measures, determining modifiable factors influencing nurses’ subjective
workload, and informing measurement strategies for subjective workload monitoring in NICUs."
10902473,"Understanding how the complex coordination of many different proteins bind to DNA and RNA provides
mechanistic insights into cellular regulatory functions. Recent developments in deep neural networks (DNNs)
have greatly enhanced our ability to accurately predict experiments in regulatory genomics. Despite their
impressive performance compared to traditional methods in computational genomics, their low interpretability
has earned them a reputation as a black box. To address this gap, post hoc interpretation methods are being
increasingly used to gain mechanistic insights underlying black box predictions. While many of the current
interpretation methods are useful, there is often a notable disagreement between their findings. These methods
have also been shown to have specific strengths, as well as blind spots in areas that are essential for gene
regulation. Despite their promise, deciphering the complexity of cellular regulatory functions learned by a DNN
through current interpretation methods remains challenging. Here we propose two complementary aims that
serve to enhance the biological insights gained from genomic DNNs. Together, the work from these aims will
create a surrogate modeling framework, which uses simplified mathematical models trained on a sequence
library to approximate the corresponding sequence–function relationships learned by a DNN. In Aim 1, we will
develop and implement a set of surrogate modeling strategies for interpreting genomic DNNs. In Aim 2, we will
develop and implement computational methods to design refined sequence libraries for improved surrogate
modeling of genomic DNNs. As the number of deep learning applications in genomics is rapidly increasing, the
biomedical community will greatly benefit from our surrogate modeling framework. This framework will be made
publicly available in a software package called SQuID (Surrogate Quantitative Interpretability for Deepnets),
providing user-friendly computational tools to characterize functional relationships learned by any DNN trained
on functional genomics assays. An ability to do so will drive new discoveries in functional genomics for any task
where deep learning has been applied, and for all future ones to come. My current position as a joint postdoc
working with Peter Koo and Justin Kinney at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) provides an ideal
environment for carrying out the proposed research, with the mentorship and training I need to transition into the
field of computational genomics. Dr. Koo develops DNN architectures and interpretation methods for functional
genomics, while Dr. Kinney develops MAVE technologies, as well as quantitative methods for analyzing the data
these technologies produce. I will also take advantage of the many training resources offered by CSHL, including
career development workshops offered at the School of Biological Sciences, as well as exposure to cutting-edge
science offered by the CSHL Meetings & Courses Program. Together, the research project and training plan
proposed here will equip me well to establish an independent research program focused on mechanistically
understanding genomic regulatory mechanisms through the lens of modern machine learning methods."
10807890,"SUMMARY
In the United States, Native American communities face the greatest burden of chronic diseases among all ethnic
groups and high rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and mortality. Elevated disease risk may be in
part attributed to arsenic in drinking water, which is a key environmental risk factor among rural households that
rely on private wells. Arsenic-related CVD risk may be modified by the biomethylation of arsenic, a pathway that
decreases arsenic toxicity and increases urinary excretion. Arsenic methylation efficiency varies between
individuals and populations and is influenced by genetic variation. However, the role of pre- and post-
transcriptional gene regulatory factors, including DNA methylation (DNAm) and microRNAs, on arsenic
methylation efficiency and arsenic-induced CVD is not fully understood. This study will leverage data and
biospecimens representing multiple omics layers from the Strong Heart Study (SHS) and Strong Heart Family
Study (SHFS), large, prospective, well characterized cohorts of Native American adults with longitudinal data on
CVD outcomes and risk biomarkers. The aims of this project are to (K00, Aim 1) determine the relationship
between DNAm, arsenic methylation efficiency, and CVD to identify epigenetic biomarkers of arsenic toxicity and
arsenic-related disease risk; (K99, Aim 2) determine the effect of genetic variation on DNAm associated with
arsenic methylation efficiency to distinguish molecular mechanisms underlying arsenic methylation phenotypes;
and (R00, Aim 3) investigate the role of microRNAs in mediating the association between arsenic exposure and
methylation efficiency and CVD risk biomarkers to elucidate molecular processes underlying arsenic-related
CVD. To accomplish these aims, Dr. Bozack will be receive mentorship from experts in environmental, molecular,
and genetic epidemiology. In the K99 phase, Dr. Bozack will also receive training in bioinformatics and machine
learning, including approaches for developing DNAm biomarkers and investigating gene-epigene interactions.
In the R00 phase, she will generate circulating microRNA expression data and will further apply her training in
clustering and network analyses to identify microRNA signatures linking arsenic exposure and methylation
efficiency to CVD risk. The proposed training and research will enable Dr. Bozack to establish an independent
research path focusing on biomarker development and applying multiple omics approaches to environmental
molecular epidemiology. Furthermore, mentorship and career development activities will facilitate her transition
to an independent researcher. Overall, this study will advance the understanding of gene regulatory factors
involved in arsenic-related CVD risk through a multiple omics perspective, which is necessary to unravel the
relationship between environmental and biological factors involved in the etiology of complex diseases. Findings
will contribute the development of noninvasive biomarkers of arsenic-related CVD risk and may aid in targeting
arsenic mitigation and public health interventions."

Proper signaling is necessary for homeostasis in multicellular organisms. Once considered mere byproducts of
cellular metabolism, small metabolites have now emerged as an important class of signaling factors that regulate
tissue and whole-body functions. However, the role of small metabolites in proteostasis and age-related
neurodegeneration is largely unexplored. We have recently found that the disaccharide maltose and the maltose-
producing amylase enzyme Amyrel preserve proteostasis of the central nervous system (CNS) during aging in
Drosophila. Specifically, Amyrel and maltose protect from tauopathy and prevent the age-related accumulation
of poly-ubiquitinated proteins in the brain and retina during aging via the transcriptional induction of chaperones.
Conversely, knockdown of SLC45 maltose transporters reduces the expression of Amyrel-induced chaperones
and worsens brain proteostasis and tauopathy. Moreover, maltose preserves proteostasis and neuronal activity
in human brain organoids challenged by thermal stress. Altogether, these findings indicate that maltose is a
novel, conserved regulator of CNS proteostasis. However, the mechanisms via which maltose preserves
proteostasis are incompletely understood and it remains unexplored how maltose impacts proteostasis across
cell compartments. Specifically, although maltose is a chemical chaperone, many small metabolites are now
known to act as signaling factors. This raises the question on whether maltose regulates proteostasis via
signaling mechanisms independent from its chemical chaperone activity. In agreement with this hypothesis, our
preliminary studies now identify the transcription factor Broad as a possible mediator of maltose-induced
chaperone expression and CNS proteostasis during aging. On this basis, we propose the following aims: to
determine the mechanisms via which Amyrel/SLC45 protects from neurodegeneration and functional decline
induced by pathogenic tau/MAPT (aim 1); to determine the impact of Amyrel/SLC45 on proteostasis in different
subcellular compartments (aim 2); and to determine whether Amyrel/SLC45 signaling regulates CNS
proteostasis and tauopathy via the transcription factor Broad (aim 3). Altogether, these studies promise to
provide fundamental understanding of a novel maltose-induced signaling pathway that preserves brain
proteostasis during aging and that protects from tauopathy. Knowledge gained from these studies will guide the
design of effective therapies to preserve and/or reinstate proteostasis in patients with tauopathies and
Alzheimer’s disease."

Acute leukemias of ambiguous lineage (ALAL) are high-risk leukemia subtypes and include mixed phenotype
acute leukemia (MPAL) and early T cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ETP-ALL). These leukemias
commonly express markers associated with both the myeloid and T lymphoid lineages which complicates choice
of therapy. Moreover, the genomic, molecular, and cellular basis of ALAL remains obscure and hinders our ability
to identify more relevant and tailored therapeutic strategies. I recently discovered a new genomic alteration that
is specific to a subset of T/myeloid MPAL and ETP-ALL cases, namely noncoding structural variations that
aberrantly activate the T cell transcription factor gene BCL11B in a non-T lineage cell of origin. Most of these
cases (81%) harbored activating mutations (e.g. internal tandem duplication, ITD) in the FLT3 tyrosine kinase
receptor gene, suggesting functional cooperation between these alterations. This discovery enables faithful
experimental modeling of the earliest stages of ALAL development. My preliminary data demonstrated that
ectopic BCL11B expression is sufficient to drive formation of phenotypic T cells from a pool of extra-thymic
human CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). However, HSPCs are a highly heterogeneous
population of cells with different stemness capacities and degrees of lineage commitment, and it remains
unknown whether a certain subpopulation is most permissive to BCL11B-induced lineage skewing or how
BCL11B transcriptional activity disrupts different HSPC gene regulatory programs to drive the lineage ambiguous
phenotype. The goal of this proposal is to define the mechanisms by which ectopic BCL11B expression
corrupts hematopoietic differentiation to drive development of ALAL. To accomplish this, Aim 1 will use a
single cell in vitro differentiation assay to determine how the developmental state of the cell of origin impacts the
ability of BCL11B/FLT3-ITD to drive lineage skewing. Aim 2 will complement this cell phenotype-based assay
with single cell RNA-seq to identify the spectrum of gene expression changes that accompany changes in
differentiation potential and lineage skewing of different cells of origin. I will also use acute protein degradation
techniques to identify direct BCL11B target genes which will inform on BCL11B-controlled transcription networks
that I will investigate in my future independent research. Collectively, these experiments will clarify the role of
the cell of origin in dictating oncogenic BCL11B activity and identify BCL11B-controlled transcription networks.
In the independent phase (Aim 3), I will investigate the molecular mechanism of BCL11B oncogenic activity to
nominate new therapeutic targets. I will first investigate how BCL11B alters chromatin regulation by identifying
changes in chromatin state and transcription factor occupancy. I will then use a new mouse model to screen for
epigenetic regulators critical for oncogenic BCL11B activity. These aims represent the first steps in elucidating
the cellular and molecular underpinnings of ALAL and will equip me with new knowledge, technical expertise,
and collaborations to establish a research program centered on the gene regulatory control of high-risk leukemia."

Chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is the leading source of persistent pain among late adolescents and young
adults (AYAs) and contributes to significant functional disability, psychosocial impairment, and reduced quality
of life. Moreover, the transitional stage of emerging adulthood presents unique challenges which can further
complicate pain-related coping and adjustment in late AYAs. The influence of risk factors on maladaptive pain-
related outcomes in youth is well-documented. However, much less is known about protective factors that may
mitigate these negative consequences and promote healthy adaptation to pain during the transition to adulthood.
It is imperative to identify these protective variables to foster positive outcomes throughout the life course.
Resilience, characterized as a dynamic, malleable process leading to positive adaptation in the face of adversity,
plays an important role in conferring adaptive responses to pain. However, resilience examined across multiple
domains of functioning (i.e., psychological, social, biological, and health/lifestyle) is yet to be explored in late
AYAs with and without chronic MSK pain. Thus, the overarching goal of this career development award (K23) is
to fill this knowledge gap by: 1) characterizing multi-domain pain resiliency (MDPR) profiles during the transition
to adulthood, and 2) investigating the utility of these profiles in predicting pain, functioning, and pain modulatory
capacity over time. Information gained from this project will be invaluable for developing patient-centered
prevention/intervention efforts. This K23 proposes scientific and training objectives that will be instrumental for
launching an independent program of research that advances the science and treatment of pain and disability in
late AYAs. The multidisciplinary mentoring team includes experts in biopsychosocial pain mechanisms,
resilience/positive psychology, pediatric/adolescent pain, and biostatistics who will provide guidance and training
necessary for achievement of professional goals that will facilitate the PI's transition to independence. Primary
training objectives for the current proposal are to: 1) expand knowledge of biopsychosocial determinants of
chronic pain, specifically factors related to promoting pain resilience across multiple domains of functioning, 2)
develop a comprehensive knowledge base for variables influencing pain during the transition to adulthood and
enhance training in the assessment and treatment of pain in late adolescents and young adults, 3) augment
statistical acumen by increasing familiarity with advanced statistical analytics necessary for clinical research,
especially for patient classification to inform patient-centered care, 4) enhance knowledge and skills necessary
for clinical trial design and implementation, as well as prevention science methodology, and 5) advance
leadership, mentoring, scholarly productivity, and other professional skills integral for fostering competency as
an academic and independent clinical and translational investigator. The proposed career development plan
extends from the PI's prior work on vulnerability mechanisms in pain, and will forge a path towards investigating
strategies that promote resilience and improve pain and disability during the transition to adulthood."

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease with limited treatment options and unclear
pathogenesis. Extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition by proliferating fibroblast populations drives the
progressive airflow limitation and hypoxia characteristic of IPF, mediated by the cytokine transforming growth
factor beta (TGFB). Direct inhibition of TGFB leads to intolerable side effects, and there is increased interest in
therapies that instead modulate its regulation. Microfibril-associated glycoproteins 1 and 2 (Magp1 and Magp2,
or Magps) are fibroblast-produced proteins which are secreted to ECM, anchor to microfibrils, and bind TGFB
to limit its signaling under basal conditions, but have no known role in fibrosis. Magp knockout (KO) mice
exhibit increased TGFB signaling in various tissues and have immune cell alterations due to bone marrow
TGFB effects. In a single cell RNASeq screen, the genes encoding these proteins were markedly upregulated
in fibroblasts in fibrotic lungs, and combined KO of Magp1 and 2 led to more severe fibrosis after bleomycin
injury in mice. This suggests that Magps act as inhibitors of fibrotic signaling and follow up studies in Magp1
and 2 individual KO mice show that deficiency of both proteins is required to produce a pro-fibrotic phenotype.
Which fibroblasts populations produce Magps and how they limit fibrosis is unknown. We hypothesize that
Magp expression is an adaptive response to lung injury and limits fibrosis by sequestering TGFB in ECM and
will explore this central hypothesis through three specific aims: 1) Evaluate anti-fibrotic contributions of
Magp1 and 2 in pulmonary fibrosis. 2) Evaluate Magp effects on TGFB signaling and immune
responses in lung fibrosis. 3) Characterize Magp-producing fibroblast populations. Using combinations
of KO and inducible/tissue-specific KO mice, we will determine the individual relationships of these proteins to
fibrosis and whether they exhibit redundant antifibrotic functions in vivo. We will analyze alterations in TGFB
signaling and immune cell infiltration in lung as possible underlying mechanisms of Magp protection from
pulmonary fibrosis. Finally, we will employ our recently developed single nucleus RNASeq approach along with
single nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (snATAC)-Seq to characterize the fibroblast
populations that express Magp1 and 2 and evaluate how lung-wide transcriptomes and epigenomes change in
the absence of Magps during fibrosis. This proposal will provide Dr. Koenitzer with the mentored training in
single cell sequencing and bioinformatics, fibroblast and ECM biology, and lung histology/imaging needed to
achieve his goal of independence as a physician-scientist. Under the oversight of an expert scientific advisory
committee, He will realize career milestones, complete formal coursework, and develop lasting collaborations.
Findings from this work will have implications beyond IPF in other interstitial lung diseases and enable Dr.
Koenitzer to develop new approaches to the treatment of lung disease as an independent investigator."

Physical disability in individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) is caused by a failure to learn and/or refine motor control
during the first two years of life, during a critical period for neuroplasticity in motor control centers. Despite this,
very little is known about how infants at high risk for CP learn (or fail to learn) to move and acquire early locomotor
skills that are building blocks for later functional mobility. The long-term goal of our work is to reduce physical
disability in individuals with CP by promoting the development of evidence-based motor training strategies to
train and shape motor learning during infancy and toddlerhood. The objective of this project is to characterize
the evolution of locomotor learning over the first 18 months of life in infants at high risk for CP. To characterize
how locomotor skill is learned (or not learned) during this critical period, we will combine our established protocols
using robust, unbiased robotic and sensor technology to longitudinally study infant movement across three
consecutive stages during the development of impaired human motor control – early spontaneous
movement, prone locomotion (crawling), and upright locomotion (walking). The spontaneous leg
movements of sixty infants will be captured in real time using wearable sensors in their natural environment over
the first 4 months of life. Infants who remain at high risk for CP at 4 months of age, which we expect to be
approximately 50% of those enrolled, will progress to novel locomotor training protocols using robotic technology
for crawling (5-9 months of age) and walking (9-18 months of age). The locomotor training protocols are
introduced before the infants’ locomotor milestones emerge or fail to emerge, and are reward- and error-based,
allowing ample opportunities for error learning while providing assistance to move when even small effort is
made (reinforcement). Repeated measures of training characteristics and locomotor skill will quantify locomotor
learning over time in infants at high risk for CP. Key training characteristics, combined with neurobehavioral
moderators such as cognition and motivation to move, will be identified and used to develop a predictive model
of locomotor learning. We hypothesize that experiencing and responding to error is a key mechanism for
locomotor learning in CP, that learning is mediated by neurobehavioral factors outside of training, and that critical
thresholds of error and other training characteristics predict the transfer of locomotor skill from prone to upright
locomotion. Our team includes experts in motor control and development, computer science, robotics,
biomechanics and neonatology. Characterizing and predicting locomotor learning in infants at high risk for CP
will inform the design of future multi-site efficacy studies and the development of new treatments to shape motor
learning during the critical years of the development of motor control, supporting the Eunice Kennedy Shriver
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development mission that all children have the chance to achieve
their full potential for healthy and productive lives, free from disease or disability, and to ensure the health,
productivity, independence, and well-being of all people through optimal rehabilitation."

TITLE: Interplay of parenting, genetics, and brain function in trajectories of resilience and risk for alcohol
use disorder among high-risk adolescents and young adults
Children of parents with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) are four times more likely to develop AUD and related
mental health problems.[1, 2] Decades of research has demonstrated the intergenerational transmission of
familial risk factors,[3] and the complex interactions between genetic and social-environmental factors (GxE)
underlying risk for AUD. Most research on development of AUD takes a risk perspective, focusing on
genomic, neurocognitive, and behavioral characteristics associated with increased risk for AUD (e.g., low
P3 amplitude even among the uninitiated high-risk offspring). Few studies focus on factors that can buffer
against liability for AUD, to improve any disadvantage of genetic and/or neural risk and to promote
normative development. The main motivation of this study is to examine potential factors that promote
resilience against AUD among high-risk offspring. Given that parents wield both genetic and social-
environmental influences on their children and are among the most important factors during child
development, this K01 will examine the interplay of parenting, genetic factors, neurocognitive function, and
alcohol behaviors with longitudinal data across adolescence and young adulthood in COGA’s enriched and
diverse families. Specifically, I will examine (1) the influence of parenting factors (e.g., parental bonding) on
development of neurocognitive function, (e.g., response inhibition) and alcohol problems (e.g., binge
drinking). (2) the interaction of parenting and genetic factors (e.g., family history density for AUD) on
neurocognitive development and alcohol problems, and (3) determine whether parenting and genetic
factors associated with neurocognitive development and alcohol problems vary by gender and
race/ethnicity. Examining the moderating and mediating pathways via which parenting can affect brain
development and resilience for AUD will help fill existing gaps in knowledge and inform prevention and
intervention strategies. This K01 proposal also delineates new training goals in Brain function and Genetic
epidemiology of AUD, and Health Disparities research. The proposed research and training will provide a
scaffold to focus on broader social-environmental factors (e.g., romantic partners) that may promote
resilience against AUD in a future R01 proposal that will be submitted at end of the K01-period. This K01
will also enable me to build and establish a career as a social neuroscientist, integrating my areas of expertise
(human attachment, psychosocial determinants of self-regulation and social decision-making) and new skills towards
a program of research focused on the interplay of social-environmental factors, genetics, and brain function
in promoting resilience towards AUD and related disorders. The proposed project is ambitious yet feasible
given my background, experience, and proposed mentorship by a team of experts (Porjesz, Meyers,
Wilson) at SUNY Downstate, consultation with Dr. Dick on GxE effects in AUD, Dr. Thompson in the
responsible presentation of diversity findings, and the K01 protected time (5 yrs) for research and training."

The objective of this career development plan and proposed research is to support my development into an
independent investigator focused on resuscitation science, who can successfully conduct mechanism-driven
and patient-oriented research for the development of novel clinical therapies in resuscitation and
cardiovascular critical care. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and
worldwide with less than 20% of patients surviving to hospital discharge and many survivors experiencing
neurologic injuries. Resuscitation guidelines have espoused treatment recommendations in the delivery of
high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the evaluation for underlying causes of OHCA. However,
despite these approaches, a substantial number of patients do not survive, suggesting a crucial need to seek
new strategies in resuscitation care. Obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) by chest
compressions has been identified as an important factor causing ineffective CPR, but neither the
hemodynamic nor the clinical impact of this has been well-established. Due to its endoscopic location,
transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can visualize the heart during the delivery of CPR, conveying unique
real-time and actionable data. This K23 resubmission proposal builds upon prior work by our team
demonstrating that TEE can be deployed rapidly and safely during resuscitation of OHCA patients, providing
high-quality dynamic imaging of the heart and major vascular structures during CPR. Furthermore, since the
original submission our team has successfully implemented a multi-center registry with 25 centers currently
participating, and demonstrated the feasibility to obtain clinical, hemodynamic, and TEE data in patients with
OHCA and in-hospital cardiac arrest. Leveraging this unique experience and infrastructure, as well as a
multidisciplinary team of content-specific mentors, the objectives of this proposal are to perform focused
clinical investigations, aimed to quantify the hemodynamic and clinical effects of TEE-guided CPR, and to
elucidate the barriers to successful implementation of this intervention in acute care settings. In Aim1, I will
leverage the existing infrastructure of our ongoing research network to conduct a multicenter observational
cohort study of adults with atraumatic SCA, aimed to evaluate the impact of TEE guidance of CC location on
hemodynamic endpoints and survival to hospital discharge. In Aim 2, using a mixed methods approach, I will
characterize the implementation determinants, barriers, and facilitators of TEE-informed resuscitation. The
results of this research could enhance the effectiveness of CPR, provide the basis for a novel patient-centric
approach with the potential to impact over 400,000 patients with cardiac arrest annually in the U.S. The
proposed activities will provide the PI with unique skills in the areas of pragmatic clinical trials, cardiovascular
physiology, and dissemination and implementation science, required to develop, evaluate and implement
interventions to improve survival and neurological outcomes from cardiac arrest."

A central role for lysosomal dysfunction has been highlighted for neurodegenerative disease mechanisms across
multiple genetic forms of movement disorders linked to degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, including
Parkinson disease (PD) and dystonia. We recently identified pathogenic mutations in BORCS5 causing a form
of early-onset neurodegeneration with severe parkinsonism and dystonia. BORCS5 encodes a subunit of the
BLOC1-related complex (BORC), which is currently known to be involved in anterograde movement of
lysosomes. However, whether BORCS5 mutations contribute to neurodegeneration through disruptions of
lysosomal trafficking or other mechanisms is not known. Physiologically, most functionally mature lysosomes
are concentrated in the neuronal body and whether the presence of active lysosomes is required for normal
neuronal homeostasis in distal axons is debated. Surprisingly, while BORCS5 complete knock-out (KO) caused
the expected reduction in centrifugal lysosomal movements, BORCS5-patients’ cells carrying the disease–
causing mutation R95Q showed impaired lysosomal maturation and defects in autophagic flux, but not the
anticipated abnormalities in lysosomal cellular distribution. These findings suggest that BORCS5 is involved in
additional essential aspects of lysosomal biology and I hypothesize that dysfunction of these novel functions of
BORCS5 is central for disease pathogenesis in patients with BORCS5 mutations. Thus, I propose to investigate
the molecular mechanisms underlying BORCS5-related neurodegeneration using long-term cultures of human
iPSC-derived DA neurons on micropatterned substrates to facilitate the study of lysosomal dynamics through
high spatial and temporal resolution live cell microscopy, coupled with lysosomal function assays and
assessment of human specific DA neuron pathological phenotypes, which we have recently identified as an
important contributor to progressive lysosomal dysfunction and degeneration in human DA neurons. In aim 1, I
will investigate which aspects of BORC5 biology that are implicated in lysosomal function and autophagy are
disrupted by disease-causing mutations in DA neurons. In aim 2, I will explore how these disrupted mechanisms
contribute to downstream pathogenic events implicated in DA neuron degeneration and explore the therapeutic
potential of BORCS5 genetic manipulation in neurons from patients with genetic forms of PD and dystonia
featuring lysosomal dysfunction. Characterizing additional rare genetic causes of lysosomal dysfunction is crucial
for recognizing clinically relevant modifiers of lysosomal activity. Ultimately, this project will help understand the
complex interplay between lysosomal positioning and lysosomal activity in human DA neurons and potentially
identify novel therapeutic angles for targeting lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegeneration. Furthermore, this
proposed research and career development plan will provide me with essential new training in experimental
techniques that will facilitate my transition to independent researcher, investigating the genetics and molecular
mechanisms of lysosomal dysfunction in degenerative movement disorders, including dystonia and PD."

Youth in foster care have documented higher rates of substance use and unmet behavioral health needs than
youth who are not involved in the child welfare system. Social determinants of health (e.g., child maltreatment,
community violence) have been consistently identified as driving increased likelihood of substance use among
foster youth and may also explain why those who use substances also experience high rates of co-occurring
mental health needs. Access to substance use prevention interventions is sorely limited in part due to
inadequate linkage between child welfare and behavioral health serving systems but also due to other factors
such as stigma, lack of intervention options that include peers with lived experiences and lack of intervention
tailoring to unique needs. Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) hold great promise to increase access to
youth substance use prevention interventions. Participatory technology co-design approaches allow for foster
youth to tailor technology interventions to their relevant multiple social and contextual drivers of health
vulnerability and inherently reduce stigma and build youth engagement because peers with lived experience
drive BIT design and content. FostrSpace is a BIT co-designed with foster youth that provides tailored
substance use prevention resources, services navigation, direct peer supports and direct in-app access to
evidence-based substance use and mental health (SU/MH) interventions. To promote successful uptake and
utilization of stand-alone technology for underserved populations such as Fostrspace, however, research
indicates additional systems and structural level intervention is required. Court Appointed Special Advocates
(CASA) are community volunteers who support and advocate for the needs of abused and/or neglected children
and who hold promise as facilitators for foster youth SU/MH services referrals. Evidence-based telementoring
and training models such as Extension for Community Health Outcomes (ECHO) have been highlighted as a
crucial strategy for expanding SU/MH services access. This study, in partnership with California CASA
programs, will study ECHO's effectiveness as an implementation strategy to facilitate FostrSpace referrals from
CASA volunteers and assess FostrSpace's reach and effectiveness in preventing SU among foster youth. RE-
AIM (Reach Effectiveness-Adoption Implementation Maintenance) and PRISM (Practical Robust
Implementation and Sustainability Model) frameworks guide aims. The R61 phase (Planning/Exploratory) will
include peer and CASA co-design meetings for implementation strategy (ECHO) and intervention (FostrSpace)
adaptation, open trial and R33 trial planning. The Hybrid II R33 trial mixed-methods design will test
effectiveness of FostrSpace in preventing progression of youth substance use and effectiveness of ECHO as
implementation strategy to increase reach of FostrSpace through CASA programs using a cluster randomized
controlled trial design comparing ECHO-FostrSpace to standard referral practice with 400 youth and 400
CASA volunteers across 10 CASA programs."

About 18.7 million adults have asthma in the United States. The airway microbiome has emerged as an essential
regulatory factor in asthma immune responses. Patients with asthma harbor altered bacterial compositions in
their airways compared to healthy individuals; the most important alteration is a decrease in beneficial
commensals and an increase in pathogenic bacteria. Our study that compared sputum bacterial compositions
between adult asthma patients and healthy individuals revealed that asthma was associated with microbial
alterations at the community and taxa levels, including changes in the abundances of Streptococcus salivarius,
Lactobacillus species, and Haemophilus species. These results are consistent with those of previous
independent human studies and have plausible biological mechanisms. However, current data on the airway
microbiome in adult patients with asthma are predominantly derived from case-control and cross-sectional
studies, which cannot evaluate temporal relationships between airway microbiota alterations and longitudinal
asthma morbidity. There is strong evidence from multiple longitudinal studies on chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) suggesting that the airway microbial composition is closely correlated with asthma
exacerbations and immune responses. However, it remains to be established whether these states are
correlated in asthma. New study approaches are needed to fill this important knowledge gap. Here, we will
perform a longitudinal cohort study with adult patients with asthma and healthy controls. We will collect induced
sputum samples at several time points over 6 months and additional sputum samples during asthma
exacerbations. We will utilize an FDA-approved electronic inhaler sensor system that will be attached to a rescue
inhaler to identify asthma exacerbations and collect induced sputum soon after these exacerbations (within 24
hours). We will perform 16S ribosome RNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to identify
the sputum bacterial community and relative abundance of different species. We have two aims in this study.
Aim 1 is to evaluate compositional fluctuations of the sputum microbiome over time. Aim 2 is to Characterize
temporal relationships of the sputum microbiome with asthma exacerbations. This proposed study will enable us
to longitudinally evaluate the relationship of airway bacteria with asthma morbidity and characterize the changing
dynamic patterns of the airway microbial community during asthma exacerbations. Successful completion of this
study could provide valuable insights and evidence for a scaled study to include immune biomarkers and clinical
indicators for further investigation."

Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is a driver of rapid evolution and adaptation in microbial communities. HGT
spreads genes among and between bacterial species and is relevant to human health as this process
disseminates antibiotic resistance genes, genes involved in toxin production, and other virulence traits.
Transduction, the transfer of genetic material by bacterial viruses (phages) or virus-like particles (VLPs), is
widespread among bacteria and plays an essential role in the evolution of bacterial pathogens. Despite the
importance of transduction to human health, our understanding of the taxonomic range, frequency, and
mechanisms of transduction between commensal and pathogenic bacteria are limited. Currently, the study of
transduction in microbial communities relies on the reconstruction of historical transduction events that shaped
extant microbial genomes. These reconstructions do not measure ongoing transduction. To address this
challenge, we developed a novel method termed transductomics, which allows us to measure near to “real time”
transduction in microbial communities and identifies the DNA sequence transduced to new bacterial recipients.
Transductomics uses shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing to identify and characterize DNA originating from
microbial cells that is carried in phages or VLPs. This technique has the power to identify transducing viruses
within microbiomes and can be used to determine the spread of virulence and antibiotic resistance traits that
contribute to pathogen success. Recent work, including our own, has shown that phages and VLPs are abundant
in the intestine. This indicates that phages and/or VLPs capable of transducing DNA to and from bacteria are
significant are understudied players in the spread of genetics traits that can promote bacterial pathogenesis.
Although our transductomics method readily identifies both active and potential transduction occurring within
diverse bacterial communities, it lacks automation, is low throughput, and labor intensive. The main goals of this
project are to establish high-throughput methods with refined resolution that allow for the measurement and
identification of transduction within bacterial pathogens and microbiomes and to examine how transduction
spreads virulence traits within the microbiota. Identifying transducing events within the microbiota and among
established pathogens will facilitate the development of precision therapies aimed at curtailing the spread of
virulence and antibiotic resistance genes among bacteria, which can limit pathogenesis."
10804611,"Individuals with lower extremity amputation (LEA) often experience relative motion between their
residual limb and the prosthetic socket, such as vertical translation and axial rotation, which can cause inefficient
dynamic load transmission from the distal prosthetic components to the residual limb. This can lead to
significant secondary consequences, such as pain, gait deviations, and discomfort that limit mobility and
autonomy. Assessments of the relative motion between the bone and the prosthetic socket have been performed,
but there is little existing data on dynamic, in vivo residual limb-socket kinematics since most investigations
have been performed using non-dynamic testing protocols, static measurements, or with unvalidated surface
marker-based motion capture systems. Dynamic Stereo X-ray (DSX) is an advanced imaging technology that can
quantify 3D bone movement and tissue/liner deformation inside a prosthetic socket during dynamic activities.
It can achieve sub-millimeter accuracy of bone pose (position and orientation) measurement during functional
movements by combining 3D models derived from CT scans with movement data from biplanar x-ray video.
 There is a substantial gap in our understanding of the complex mechanics of the residual limb-socket
interface during dynamic activities that limit the ability to improve prosthetic design. Our 4-year goals for this
project are to develop the analytical tools to quantify both the dynamic, in-vivo kinematics between the residual
limb and socket, as well as the mechanism of residual tissue/liner deformation. In order to validate the sensitivity
of this methodology to differences in socket suspension, we will evaluate 2 suspension systems: elevated vacuum
(EV) and simple suction. We hypothesize that an efficient and highly accurate method to quantify the dynamic
interaction between the residual limb and prosthetic socket will be sensitive enough to distinguish between
different types of prosthetic socket suspension, which will further the biomechanical understanding of socket
design. To do so, the investigators will address the following aims: (1) To optimize the DSX procedural setup for
the accurate tracking of the prosthetic socket, skeletal kinematics, and tissue/liner deformation; (2) To quantify
the relative motion between the residual tibia and the prosthetic socket during dynamic activities; and (3) To
measure the deformation of the skin and liner in the prosthetic socket during dynamic activities.
 To address these aims, we will first employ a cadaver study to optimize the placement of an array of radio-
opaque beads and markers on the socket, liner, and skin to simultaneously assess both dynamic skeletal
movement and residual tissue/liner deformation. Five cadaver limbs will be utilized in an iterative process to
develop an optimal marker setup. Stance phase gait will be simulated during each DSX session to induce bone
movement and skin/liner deformation. The number and placement of markers will be evaluated after each
session to refine the marker placement to track skin/liner deformation and skeletal movement. Once an optimal
marker setup is identified, 21 subjects with transtibial amputation will be fit with a socket capable of being
suspended via both EV and traditional suction. Subjects will undergo a 4-week acclimation period and then be
tested at the DSX facility at Rutgers University. DSX will be utilized to track skeletal and skin/liner motion under
both suspension techniques during 3 dynamic activities: treadmill walking at self-selected speed, fast walking
(10% faster), and a step-down movement. The performance of the two suspension techniques (active EV and
normal suction) will be tested by quantifying the 3D bone movement of the residual tibia with respect to the
prosthetic socket and quantifying liner and soft tissue deformation at the socket-residuum interface.
 By using the analytical tools for a highly accurate, in-vivo assessment of residual limb-socket motion, we
can provide vital foundational information to aid in the development of new methods and techniques to enhance
prosthetic fit that have the potential to reduce secondary physical comorbidities and degenerative changes that
result from complications of poor prosthetic load transmission."

an important relation between endogenous opioid signaling and cognitive factors in the treatment of AUD;
however, lapses in treatment can quickly reinstate alcohol drinking, highlighting a knowledge gap in our
understanding of how these mechanisms may influence long-term misuse. In this regard, alcohol consumption
stimulates the release of endogenous opioids, including enkephalins that bind to mu-type opioid receptors (MOR)
commonly found in limbic areas of the brain. The manipulation of MOR signaling alters the rewarding properties
of alcohol, with agonists facilitating reward and consumption, and antagonists blocking these responses. The
shared relation between opioidergic responses that underlie motivation and cognition are not well understood
but present a focal point for addressing complex pathologies that may underlie alcohol-related sensitivities. In
this regard, MORs are found in frontal cortical regions that modulate cognitive function, such as the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Preclinical studies in our laboratory demonstrate that alcohol dependence in rats
decreases the phosphorylation of MOR in the mPFC, and increases expression of the neuropeptide precursor,
proenkephalin (PENK). This pattern of changes overlaps with clinical observations of MOR desensitization in
AUD patients. The findings suggest that dependence may dysregulate opioidergic signaling in the mPFC,
although the extent to which such conditions surmise changes in the endogenous ligands is unclear. A better
understanding is warranted given that adherence to opiate antagonists diminishes over protracted abstinence
and may be undermined by molecular intermediates in the processing of small-opioid peptides. Here, we will
explore the central hypothesis that non-canonical PENK signaling in the mPFC plays a pivotal role in
dysregulating cognitive function during abstinence. Towards this goal, discovery-based and quantitative mass
spectrometry approaches will be combined with in vivo microdialysis to broadly capture PENK-mediated
signaling in alcohol-dependent rats undergoing abstinence (Aim 1). We will then explore the functional relevance
of non-canonical PENK signaling in an operant model of cognitive flexibility, and further determine whether
similar dysfunctions in dependence are modulated by mPFC MOR (Aim 2). The results are expected to provide
insight into druggable targets that extend beyond conventional opioidergic signaling processes and will lay the
foundation for mechanistic studies exploring the role of non-canonical PENK signaling in driving vulnerability to
addiction behavior."

Emerging evidence suggests that shift workers, particularly those who work nights, are at a higher risk of mild
cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This is mainly due to the repeated disruption of the sleep-
wake schedule (circadian disruption) and poor sleep (e.g., less deep sleep and/or shorter sleep time). However,
there are inter-individual differences in the ability to adapt (resilience) or not adapt (intolerance) to night-shift
work, resulting in different sleep problems and cognitive responses in shift workers. Yet, we do not have a
physiological or biological marker sensitive enough to reflect the level of adaptability to shift work and predict the
risk of future cognitive impairment. The overarching goal of our research program is to identify biomarkers that
may determine resilient vs. intolerance subtypes of shift workers and predict the risk of AD in the future. As a
first step, the proposed study will examine the feasibility of establishing a cohort of active and retired shift workers
and evaluate the study procedures for the comprehensive assessment of sleep, shift work-related symptoms,
cognitive function, and biological markers. We will also generate preliminary data on whether objective sleep
quality measures on night and day sleep (Aim 1) and/or epigenetic changes (i.e., DNA methylation) in circadian
genes (Aim 2) can explain variations in shift work-related symptoms and early plasma markers of AD. Findings
will inform future larger studies to evaluate potential mechanisms by which disrupted sleep due to shift work may
develop AD. We will recruit (a) active, younger shift workers (n=25; night shift, aged 40-64 years) and 25-day
workers (without known sleep issues) and (b) retired, older shift workers (n=25; worked night shifts ≥ 10 years
in the past and aged ≥ 65 years) and 25 age-matched controls, in Las Vegas, NV, the largest 24-hour city in the
world. Baseline assessments will include: (a) a survey about work history and conditions, sleep patterns, shift
work-related symptoms (insomnia, excessive sleepiness, and fatigue), medical conditions and medications,
lifestyle and demographic factors, (b) cognitive function, (c) blood draw for AD markers and DNA methylation,
(d) overnight-urine collection for melatonin, (e) two-week actigraphy with sleep-and-activity log, and (f) multiple-
night home sleep studies (≥2 nights and ≥2 days in night-shift workers; ≥2 nights in day workers). Primary
measures for objective sleep quality will include percentage of deep sleep in total sleep time, wake time after
sleep onset, and sleep depth index, calculated using raw electroencephalogram (EEG) signals from the sleep
studies. We will quantify the level of DNA methylation at CpG sites across 22 core circadian genes. To affirm the
role of those potential markers in the diagnosis of shift work tolerance and prediction of severe cognitive
impairment/AD, both younger and older preclinical AD cohorts will be expanded and prospectively followed in
future grants. A prospective investigation of AD biomarkers in younger adults will significantly impact public
health by guiding personalized, biobehavioral interventions that can detect the risk of AD and prevent AD onset
in the early stage of life."

This is a proposal to fund an established post-doctoral training program called the Columbia Cancer Research
Training Program for Resident-Investigators (CAPRI) focused on training physician-scientists in translational
cancer medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC). Over the past 5 years and with
ongoing institutional support for our CAPRI program, we have trained 11 resident-investigators (RIs) from 6
different clinical departments, including 2 residents from underrepresented minoritized (URM) backgrounds.
For this resubmission, we will expand CAPRI from 2 to 4 RIs per year and we will focus on the largest
residency programs with the majority not having built-in research years. We have successfully recruited
residents from multiple disciplines and leveraged the resources of the Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer
Center (HICCC) at CUIMC, including 36 NIH-funded faculty in basic, clinical/translational, and population
sciences and the rich training environment. With the ongoing expansion and institutional commitment to
oncology, we have added over 20 independent investigators to our pool of research preceptors (RPs) who will
provide direct supervision of the trainees. Through new leadership at CUIMC, the thematic research areas of
our Cancer Center focus on precision medicine and cancer health disparities. Recent initiatives, such as the
HICCC Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination (CRTEC) core, provide additional opportunities
for training and career enhancement activities for resident-investigators. In order to increase diversity in the
academic workforce, we have specifically added a Committee for Diversity Enhancement to foster these efforts
within CAPRI. The principal aim of CAPRI is to provide comprehensive training in the design and conduct of
state-of-the-art research to highly motivated physicians (MD or MD-PhD) dedicated to academic careers in
clinical cancer medicine. With an emphasis on multi-disciplinary team science, our goal is to facilitate the
development of translational researchers drawn from 5 CUIMC residency programs, including Medicine,
Pathology, Pediatrics, Radiation Oncology, and Surgery. CAPRI will provide RIs with the advanced skills
necessary to:
 1. Design and conduct rigorous hypothesis-driven research that encompasses the cancer care continuum
 of prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and palliative care with the goals of
 reducing morbidity and mortality from this disease and reducing health disparities;
 2. Translate promising pre-clinical and observational findings into cancer clinical trials that prospectively
 evaluate biological and clinical endpoints, and
 3. Conduct clinical cancer research in a multi-disciplinary team setting in which physician-scientists, basic
 scientists, and population scientists collaborate and interact to expedite and accelerate the translation
 of research findings into the clinical setting."

Despite highly effective anti-retroviral therapy (ART), the latent HIV-1 reservoir in resting CD4+ T cells is the
major barrier to a functional cure of HIV-1 infection. Our overall objectives of this R61/R33 bi-phasic project are:
to understand the mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 RNA in HIV-1-infected individuals who
are on ART (Exploratory R61 phase), and to develop a novel therapeutic strategy to alter RNA post-
transcriptional modifications as a potential therapeutic platform for inhibiting HIV-1 replication (Developmental
R33 phase).
Our multidisciplinary group is uniquely poised to address several key questions highlighted in this funding
opportunity. My lab was among three groups that independently discovered that N6-methyladenosine (m6A)
modifications of HIV-1 RNA modulate viral replication in CD4+ T cells in vitro. Using CD4+ T cell lines and
primary CD4+ T cells from healthy donors, we investigated the mechanisms by which m6A modifications
modulate HIV-1 infection. We also found that m6A modifications of HIV-1 RNA inhibit innate antiviral immune
responses in primary macrophages from healthy donors. Our in vitro studies suggested that m6A modifications
of HIV-1 RNA play a critical role in viral replication and innate immune responses to viral infection. However, the
role of m6A modifications of HIV-1 RNA in regulating viral replication in HIV-1-infected individuals on ART
remains unknown. We aim to fill this important knowledge gap and to translate the findings into potential anti-
HIV-1 therapeutics.
We hypothesize that m6A modifications of HIV-1 RNA help establish and maintain viral latency in CD4+ T cells
and avoid innate antiviral immune responses in HIV-1 infected individuals on ART. To test this hypothesis and
to facilitate the development of a novel strategy for HIV-1 cure, we designed three specific aims in two phases:
(1) R61 phase (years 1-3): Aim 1. To determine m6A profile of HIV-1 RNA in subsets of CD4+ T cells from ART-
treated patients; Aim 2. To identify cellular targets in the m6A pathway important for HIV-1 reactivation in primary
CD4+ T cells; and (2) R33 phase (years 4-5): Aim 3. To examine anti-HIV-1 effects of small molecules inhibiting
m6A modifications in primary CD4+ T cells.
Overall Impact: These studies will reveal how m6A modifications of HIV-1 RNA regulate viral latency in ART-
treated patients. The studies in the R61 phase will define new mechanisms of HIV-1 persistence and identify
potential therapeutic targets. The R33 phase study will develop an m6A-specific strategy to inhibit HIV-1
replication in primary CD4+ T cells."
10809075,"0BPROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
As efforts to identify rare neurogenetic conditions (NGC) earlier in life increase, there is a growing need for
accessible, empirically based intervention programs to support early development and encourage family
well-being. Systematic empirical studies of early intervention (EI) for NGCs are severely lacking, primarily
due to most children not receiving an accurate diagnosis until later in childhood. As a result, even children
who are diagnosed earlier than average do not receive interventions targeted to the known developmental
sequalae for their condition, a lost opportunity to make an impactful difference for these children and their
caregivers. The consequences of this lost opportunity may be exacerbated for children of color, who are
already at higher risk for later diagnoses and other health inequalities. The Parent Infant Interac(X)tion
Intervention (PIXI) is a telehealth-based EI program designed to support the adaptation of caregivers to a
new, rare NGC diagnosis in their infants and to provide parent-mediated intervention to improve child
outcomes across the first year of life. PIXI is delivered remotely, providing centralized deployment of support,
information, surveillance, and intervention in the comfort of the family home. The proposed study includes
two aims: (1) identify participation facilitators and barriers for Black/African American and Hispanic families
and (2) conduct a feasibility study of PIXI for Black/African American and Hispanic families. The proposed
project is expected to result in a manualized framework and protocol for providing rapid and virtual
deployment of support and intervention for infants with NGCs from diverse backgrounds. Results may also
increase health equity and inform the potential for EI programming to contribute to “net benefit” in decisions
regarding inclusion of these conditions on future newborn screening panels. Further, this study will provide
insight into the perceived and experienced challenges to participation in telehealth and virtual interventions
for families of color, who have traditionally been underrepresented in research on rare diseases. We will use
a combination of stakeholder input and individual interviews to conduct a comprehensive assessment of
facilitators, barriers, and delivery preferences for participation in PIXI among Black/African American or
Hispanic caregivers of a young child with an NGC. This will be a prospective case series design. We will
conduct a pilot with up to 10 infants from families of color, diagnosed with one of our target NGCs during
their first year of life. This study will provide critical information needed to assure PIXI will be an accessible
program for families from a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences. It will allow us to further develop
PIXI to support families of children with rare conditions while accounting for cultural differences that may
impact participation. In addition, this study will inform future studies seeking to engage families of color in
research and improve health care access, especially for those facing a rare disease."

Patients with hematological malignancies, and immunocompromised patients are highly susceptible to Candida
infection. Based on the immune status of the host, the infections may be mild to life- threatening. The goal is to
find novel treatment approaches to give long-term protection against opportunistic Candida spp. without
disturbing normal gut microflora. The rationale underlying this proposal is that the development of CAR-T cell
and CAR-Macrophage based cell therapies will target and recruit host immune system to protect against
opportunistic Candida infection. Recently chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) T-cell based therapy has
revolutionized cancer treatment strategy and showed overall success rate of more than 90% in hematological
malignancies. In pre-clinical studies Aspergillus specific CAR T cells has shown significant reduction in fungal
burden. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to develop CAR constructs to target systemic Candida infections
without disturbing normal gut microflora. We will generate CAR constructs by fusing extracellular domain of the
pattern recognition receptors with cytoplasmic domain of the activation receptors (CA-CAR). The central
hypothesis will
overcome barriers and immune evasion tactics imposed by the Candida spp.
 The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims.:
Aim 1). Generation and functional characterization of T-cells expressing CA-CARs:
Aim 2). Generation and functional characterization of macrophages expressing CA-CARs:
Aims 1 and 2 can be done simultaneously without being dependent on each other. These include (i)
generating CAR constructs by fusing Candida specific targeting domain with cell activating receptors; (ii)
expression of CARs in T cells and macrophages using molecular biology and tissue culture techniques; and
(iii) performing fungicidal assays by monitoring fungal growth real-time using image scanning microscope.
Functional efficacy studies will be done by co-culturing Candida yeast and Candia hyphae. In-vivo efficacy
studies will be done in NSG mice bearing systemic candidiasis. The proposed research is significant, because
it is the first cell-based therapy designed to target Candida that spares the normal commensals. It is also
significant because it will develop a platform that can be extended to study and control other opportunistic
infections. To protect patients from unanticipated CAR T cell/ CAR-Macrophage related toxicity, we will include
a mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (mEGFR) safety switch to induce apoptosis in CAR T cells. This can
be activated by targeting with mEGFR specific antibody. The results of this study will have an important
positive impact especially to overcome barriers such as virulence, antifungal resistance and recruit host
immune system for clearing pathogens. The expected outcomes are that this proposal will lay the groundwork
to develop suitable CARs to control other opportunistic pathogens and provide long-term benefit."

10814941,"Pathogenic mutations in the tau gene (MAPT) are linked to the onset of tauopathy, but the A152T mutation is unique in acting as a risk factor for a range of disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). As an unconventional approach to investigate the role of tau in neurodegeneration, we reasoned that understanding how the A152T variant modulates risk of AD and related disorders could reveal a common disease mechanism(s), uncovering novel strategies to increase resilience to tau toxicity and modify disease phenotypes in patients. Given the introduction of a new potential phosphoepitope, we questioned whether the A152T variant might impact disease risk through altered phosphorylation of tau on either T152 or the neighboring T153 residue. A series of novel antibodies were generated to test this idea, which revealed significant accumulation of soluble tau species hyperphosphorylated on T153 (pT153) in postmortem brain tissue from A152T carriers compared to noncarriers, as well as in mice expressing A152T-AAV. Therefore the current project will investigate the overall hypothesis that the A152T variant modulates disease risk through enhanced accumulation and increased solubility of pT153-positive tau, which subsequently primes tau for downstream pathological phosphorylation events and is critical for tau-mediated toxicity. Of note, phosphorylation on T153 and tau’s other serine/threonine-proline motifs has been shown to be required for tau toxicity, although the extent to which pT153 contributes to tau toxicity remains untested. In elucidating the pattern of pT153 deposition throughout the brain in A152T carriers and noncarriers, the
proposed studies will determine if pT153-positivity coincides with neurodegeneration. Using site-directed mutagenesis and somatic brain transgenesis, we will determine whether pT153 is required for tau toxicity in vivo. Finally, incorporating rapidly evolving technology that is enabling acquisition of global gene expression profiles at the single cell level, we will assess whether expression of the A152T variant differentially impacts the transcriptome of individual cell populations. We anticipate that in uncovering the mechanisms by which A152T influences risk of tauopathy, and deciphering the involvement of pT153 in tau toxicity, the current project could identify novel approaches to block tau-mediated neurodegeneration in AD and related disorders."
10814950,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvulopathy affecting over 170 million worldwide. Every year, 0.4-
1.9% of individuals with MVP will develop sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD), and 7%
of SCDs in the young are caused by MVP. However, predictors of this devastating outcome are not readily
available, and indications for a primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in MVP are lacking.
Severe mitral regurgitation explains only 50% of SCA cases in MVP. SCD/SCA risk has also been linked to a
bileaflet phenotype with mild MR, mitral annular disjunction (MAD), and left ventricular focal fibrosis on cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR)-late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images. Such imaging parameters (including
LGE) have not been evaluated prospectively. Moreover, they are not consistently found in SCA survivors, and
diffuse fibrosis has been proposed as an alternative arrhythmic substrate by our group and others based on
CMR/T1 mapping, strain echocardiography, and post-mortem data. Overall, it is challenging to pinpoint a unique
imaging phenotype, and uncertainty exists about which MVP patients should undergo CMR. Regardless of
arrhythmic phenotype, complex ventricular ectopy (ComVE - defined as frequent polymorphic PVCs, bigeminy
or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) is detected in 80-100% of MVP cases prior to SCA or SCD. ComVE,
commonly associated with left ventricular fibrosis on CMR, is linked to higher all-cause mortality and SCA rates
(20% versus 12% if no ComVE, p < 0.05) based on preliminary cross-sectional data. Our central hypothesis is
that MVP patients with ComVE, because of the higher prevalence of either LGE or abnormal T1 mapping,
represent ideal CMR candidates regardless of leaflet involvement or MAD, and can be rapidly identified by an
automated “surveillance” tool within a large echocardiographic database. Moreover, we hypothesize that fibrosis
is the strongest predictor of SCD/SCA in an unprecedented, multi-center effort to longitudinally assess clinical
and CMR parameters of arrhythmic risk in MVP. Specifically, we aim to 1) Assess the role of CMR as a screening
tool for fibrosis in MVP with ComVE incorporating T1 mapping in addition to LGE in an unselected MVP sample;
2) Develop an echo-based machine-learning algorithm to detect MVP with ComVE, test its association with
myocardial fibrosis on CMR and longitudinal SCD/SCA risk; and 3) Build a novel prospective SCD/SCA risk
prediction model in MVP. Better selection of CMR candidates and development of a SCD/SCA risk prediction
tool inclusive of fibrosis by CMR are expected to dramatically improve risk stratification in MVP and establish
future criteria for primary prevention ICD trials."

MPC’s Administrative Core maximizes the efficiency of funding for population dynamics research by minimizing 
the time and energy researchers spend dealing with financial, human resource, and other administrative 
requirements. The Administrative Core provides leadership by coordinating activities and resources across 
cores. It increases the productivity of MPC members by maintaining excellent facilities and offering cost-effective 
services and by reducing the administrative burdens of research, particularly those related to grants 
administration, fiscal management, and human resources. Administrative Core leadership and staff are 
responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Center and for planning for the continued development of MPC. 
Services fall into five categories: (1) accounting and finance; (2) grants management; (3) human resources; (4) 
facilities; and (5) communications. 
Accounting and finance: The most critical function of the Administrative Core is coordinating and monitoring all 
aspects of MPC finances. Grants management: The Administrative Core provides budget support for proposal 
development, maintains records of current and pending support, manages IRB and human subjects training, 
manages subcontracts and consulting agreements, coordinates annual reports, and handles public access 
requirements (e.g., PubMed Central). Human resources: In addition to efficiently handling routine human 
resources tasks for MPC’s large staff, the Administrative Core exerts considerable effort on recruitment and 
retention of employees. Facilities: The Administrative Core ensures that all research projects have outstanding 
facilities in which to work. Communications: The Administrative Core communicates members’ research news 
via traditional and social media. It also keeps members and staff up to date on policies and procedures, informs 
them of new initiatives and opportunities, and responds to member requests for services. 
The Administrative Core Lead is MPC Director John Robert Warren. The Administrative Core arranges monthly 
meetings of the Advisory Board and fortnightly meetings of the Executive Committee. All MPC members are 
eligible to use MPC Administrative Core services, although priority is given to new and early stage investigators. 
The Core also provides services to population dynamics researchers at non-P2C funded institutions. Without the 
Administrative Core, the most productive MPC researchers would be forced to devote a large percentage of their 
time to tasks such as human resources and grant administration. This would be an inefficient investment of 
resources, from both a scientific and an economic perspective."

HIV-1 RNA interacts with many host proteins, some of which enhance and some of which inhibit viral replication.
This project will focus on protein:RNA complexes involving HIV-1 RNA and host proteins. Because the HIV-1
genome has all the features of a cellular mRNA, the question of whether and how the HIV-1 genome is
differentiated from cellular mRNAs, or ‘sensed’ by host cell proteins is an important principle underpinning this
project. Distinguishing features of HIV-1 RNAs include RNA sequence, structures, compositional biases and
base modifications. These features of the HIV-1 RNA can enable recognition by antiviral proteins or sensors,
which feature prominently in the project. The team will continue its existing collaboration on the structure and
function of APOBEC3 proteins, and will build on their prior crystallographic studies of APOBEC3H:RNA
interactions to determine how APOBEC3H:RNA binding inhibits HIV-1 infection independently of deamination
activity. The team will also determine the structure of an APOBEC3H-Vif complex and will use structural
approaches to determine how viral RNA is recognized by additional APOBEC3 proteins. Additionally, the team
will build on its prior groundbreaking discoveries of zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) and its CpG RNA target
sequence to explore the function of protein complexes containing ZAP and its cofactors. They will determine the
structures of ZAP domains, the full-length ZAP protein, and complexes containing ZAP with cofactors TRIM25,
Riplet and/or KHNYN. They will also use structural biology approaches to determine the mechanistic basis for
specific RNA recognition by ZAP, and biological assays to determine the features of optimal CpG-rich ZAP target
sequences. The team will also pursue structural, biochemical, and biological investigations of another antiviral
protein that binds HIV-1 RNA, TRIM56. The mechanism of action of TRIM56 is poorly understood, thus the team
will determine which viral and cellular RNAs are recognized by TRIM56, and how that recognition leads to
recruitment of effector functions that affect the fate of targeted RNAs and consequently HIV-1 replication. In
addition to detailed studies of known HIV-1 RNA:host protein interactions, the team will also execute a number
of exploratory/discovery studies, including various screening approaches to identify cellular proteins that interact
with HIV-1 RNA. They will identify novel host proteins that participate in the epitranscriptomic regulation of HIV-
1 RNA fate and investigate the how the m6A reader YTHDF2 regulates RNA stability. The team will also identify
RNA-binding interferon-stimulated gene products with anti-HIV-1 activity and zinc finger proteins that affect HIV-
1 replication Finally, the team will explore how the unusually biased HIV-1 RNA nucleotide composition affects
viral replication. Thus, the scope of the project encompasses investigations intended to discover novel RNA-
protein interactions, as well as studies devoted to atomic level structural characterization of HIV-1 RNA-protein
interactions."
10815814,"This Project consists of a deep analysis of the structures that form on HIV-1 RNAs in infected cells, the viral and
host proteins with which they interact, and the critical roles these structures play in HIV-1 gene expression. The
virus uses specific RNA structures to regulate gene expression, but in many cases the actual folded structures
of the RNAs and of the larger complexes they form with proteins are not yet known in any detail. We have
assembled a powerful team of investigators with the broad range of skills and expertise needed to determine the
structures, to define the essential portions of the RNAs needed for biological activity, and to unravel the
mechanism of action of the RNA-protein complexes that promote virus gene expression and replication. The
steps of the viral life cycle that we propose to examine will include: the synthesis of RNA transcripts by RNA
polymerase II elongation, as allowed by the release from arrest mediated by the Tat protein, P-TEFb subunits
and the TAR RNA; the alternative splicing of HIV-1 RNAs, as controlled by cis-acting elements at the splice sites
of the viral precursor RNA; the selective nuclear export of spliced, partially spliced and unspliced mRNAs as
controlled by Rev action at the RRE element and by nuclear pore subunits; and the translation of viral mRNAs,
including the role of the 5' cap in determining the fate of the RNAs, and the activity of the RNA hairpin at the site
of translational frameshifting in regulating expression of the long Gag-Pro-Pol precursor protein. We will study
structures of “naked” RNAs in solution, but also in the context of RNA-protein complexes as they exist in intact
infected cells. We will use powerful genetic tools and rapid readouts of gene expression to identify host factors
involved in these various processes, mutagenesis and CRISPR-based knockouts to probe the functions of these
factors and the details of their interactions with RNA. We have come to appreciate that many of the RNA
structures are highly dynamic and consist of a constellation of alternative forms – clearly true in the cases of the
TAR element, the 5' cap and 5' UTR sequence that control RNA utilization, the splicing regulatory elements, and
the translational frameshift element. Our team will apply advanced methods capable of monitoring these dynamic
rearrangements at multiple time scales. The results will break new ground in discovery, design, and optimization
of viral inhibitors targeting RNA. We initially will address all these RNA structures and their functions in the
context of the actively replicating virus in lytic growth in T cells, readily studied in culture. In addition, we are
interested in the distinctive regulation of these steps that occurs in the establishment and maintenance of latency,
a state allowing persistence of virus as transcriptionally silent proviruses. We will take advantage of a new model
of latency to define changes in the RNA structures and the way they are recognized by the altered proteome of
the memory T cell. The multiple investigators in this Project are experienced, highly focused on the issues, and
prepared to make rapid progress on each Aim outlined for the Project."
10786010,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As humans age, their immune systems become dysfunctional. Specifically, aging impacts adaptive immunity
leading to reduced response to vaccines. A productive immune response to vaccines is characterized by high
affinity antibodies and an increase in antigen-specific memory B and T cells. Intense research efforts have
determined the role of T cells in aging; however the role of B cells is less clear. We hypothesize that humans,
like mice, have age-related B cells (ABCs) in blood that can be tracked by clonal expansion, and in
within tissue, outcompete important tissue specific B cell types, therefore limiting the capacity of older
adults to respond to vaccines. We have assembled a team that span topic areas and technical expertise to
address difficult questions of human B cell dysfunction with age. We utilize longitudinal and cross-sectional
design to assess B cell aging in blood and lymphoid tissues. Further, we leverage a novel in vitro human tonsil
organoid model we developed that allows mechanistic testing of age-induced B cell decline of vaccine
responses, a feat previously impossible. In Aim 1, we will identify human ABCs by mapping dysregulation of
phenotypic and functional B cell signatures over time. We hypothesize that ABCs are memory B cells that
accumulated epigenetic changes, leading to a transcriptional program consisting of muted BCR
responsiveness, dysregulated expansion, and defective function. We will analyze peripheral blood B cells and
serum from a healthy aged longitudinal cohort using high-parameter flow cytometry and bulk RNA sequencing
and multiplexing to track changes in B cell subsets, transcriptional profiles, BCR repertoires, and cytokine and
antibody secretion. In Aim 2, we will target age-related mechanisms of lymphoid tissue B cell dysfunction to
improve effective flu vaccine responses. ABCs are thought to derive from expansion of memory B cells.
Therefore, we hypothesize that lymphoid tissues with high antigen exposure will have higher prevalence of
ABCs and increased signatures of aging. Furthermore, we anticipate that targeting ABCs using a human tonsil
organoid platform will improve flu vaccine responses. With unparalleled access to multiple post-mortem
lymphoid tissues, we will compare B cells from young and older adults. We will use high parameter flow
cytometry to enumerate B cell populations and perform single cell RNA sequencing on sorted B cells across
human blood and tissues. Additionally, we will assess metabolism and cytokine secretion of aging B cells
across tissues using extracellular flux analysis and multiplex cytokine profiling. Lastly, we will use a novel in
vitro human tonsil organoid model to determine the cellular and molecular mediators of impaired vaccine
responses. Understanding how age impacts B cell function will allow for improvement of vaccine design to
increase B cell antibody responses, and therefore better protect the aging population of the world."
10789927,"SUMMARY
Senescence is a stress response program that provides a potent barrier to cancer progression, and restoration
of this program in advanced cancers can produce potent anti-tumor effects. Conversely, the aberrant
accumulation of senescent cells in tissues contributes to pathologies associated with aged and damaged tissue,
such that elimination of senescent cells from these tissues can ameliorate disease symptoms in mice.
Consequently, strategies to trigger senescence in cancer, or eliminate senescent cells in aged or damaged
tissues, are of potential clinical significance. Superficially, cellular senescence involves a two component
process: on one hand, the p53 and RB tumor suppressors control a gene repression program that leads to stable
cell cycle arrest; on the other hand, transcriptional activators such as NF-kB execute a gene activation program,
leading to the production of a range of secreted or cell surface proteins collectively known as the senescence
associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The molecular composition and biological roles of the SASP are
diverse, but SASP factors include growth factors, immune modulators and matrix metalloproteinases, and thus
the process can contribute to both the anti-tumor effects but also to the deleterious consequences of senescence
in aged or damaged tissues. Our team combines the extensive expertise of the Lowe laboratory in senescence
mechanisms and biology with the innovation of the Sadelain group in developing chimeric antigen receptor T
(CAR T) cells capable of targeting cell surface proteins for therapeutic purposes. Our goals are to identify novel
cell surface markers that are selectively expressed in senescent cells for the purpose of better identifying and
characterizing senescent cells in tissues and as biomarkers for senescence related diseases. In parallel, we
exploit the selective features of these molecules with the aim of producing senolytic CAR T cells, which we then
characterize in preclinical senescence models and, if successful, apply as tools to interrogate senescence
biology in vivo. Preliminary data strongly supports the feasibility of the proposed work: we have already identified
one cell surface molecule that is predominantly expressed on senescent cells, and produced CAR T cells
targeting it. We further provide preliminary data to demonstrate that these CAR T cells behave as bona fide
senolytics, capable of eliminating senescent cells in culture and in mice. In our application, we continue to
validate the protein and CAR T cells as useful tools and in preclinical models, and work towards the development
of enhanced versions of the CAR T that, with further validation, could be developed clinically. We expect our
studies to better define the senescent state, produce new insights into senescence biology, and produce a new
therapeutic modality for treating senescence associated pathologies."

 Advancements in therapy have drastically improved life expectancy for people living with HIV and many
individuals are living well into older adulthood. Older adults living with HIV, defined as those who are 50 years
and older, make up almost half of all individuals living with HIV in the US. Although life expectancy has
increased, older adults living with HIV have greater risk for multiple physical, mental, and psychosocial health
burdens compared to uninfected older adults. It is well documented that people living with HIV are at increased
risk for impaired cognition, including cognitive impairment leading to dementia and Alzheimer’s Disease, and
HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). The consequences of cognitive impairment among this
population have far reaching implications for population and public health. Impaired individuals may lose the
ability to fully engage in activities involved in HIV care, such as adherence to antiretroviral therapies. Impaired
individuals may also lose the ability to fully engage in other health promoting and beneficial behaviors such as
participate in physical and leisure activities, and activate or utilize positive resources like social support,
purpose in life, and financial resources. Taken within a broader life course context, having multiple life
stressors may also negatively impact the ability to engage in health behaviors and resources and influence
cognitive outcomes. However, research has yet to disentangle the impact of cognition on engagement in
healthy behaviors within the context of positive resource utilization in older adults with HIV. A greater
understanding of this is needed given the aging of the population living with HIV and the corresponding public
health burden. The overall goals of the proposed Career Development Award (K01) goals are to investigate the
relationship between cognitive deficits and health promoting behaviors, clarify the moderating role of positive
resources, and to determine the cumulative impact of these interactions on quality of life for older adults
experiencing stress while living with HIV. This will be achieved through the completion of the proposed training
plan, organized under the four content domains of cognition, HIV and aging, biostatistics and longitudinal
research design, and professional development. This training plan was designed with the goal of launching the
PI’s career as an independent investigator with a research program focused on the interplay of cognition,
psychosocial factors, and life stress on health and successful aging in individuals aging with HIV."

Standard-of-care treatments for most sarcomas and other childhood cancers include high-doses of
anthracyclines, in particular doxorubicin (DOXO). DOXO causes irreparable damage to normal tissues,
especially the heart, and late-onset cardiomyopathy is one of the leading causes of death among childhood
cancer survivors. In addition, relapse is common in patients with sarcoma and fewer than 20% of patients who
relapse can be cured. Experimental therapies are often their only option but the cardiotoxicity of primary therapy
creates a major clinical challenge for these patients: investigational drugs and drug combinations for relapsed
disease cannot incur additional cardiotoxic effects. Unfortunately, a priori knowledge about the potential
cardiotoxicity of investigational agents and combinations is almost never available. Thus, there is a critical need
to develop preclinical models that can reliably assess the cardiotoxic effects of experimental therapies before
they are advanced to clinical trials in patients. In this proposal, we will combine our multi-disciplinary expertise
in oncology and cardiology to develop less cardiotoxic treatment options for patients with relapsed Ewing
sarcoma (EwS). We will combine mouse xenograft models with zebrafish small molecule screening to (1)
improve our ability to predict cardiotoxic effects of combination therapies, (2) accelerate the identification and
translation of effective combination drug therapies, and (3) identify small molecule combinations with anti-tumor
activity but decreased cardiotoxicity. EwS is an aggressive tumor that peaks in adolescence. Tumors are critically
dependent on epigenetic reprogramming and abundant preclinical data from our own group and others have
shown the promise of epigenetic modifiers as investigational agents for EwS patients. However, epigenetic
agents are not effective as single agents and combination approaches are needed. The potential cardiotoxic
effects of most epigenetic drugs, either alone or in combination, is yet unknown. Studies in this project will focus
on testing epigenetic agents alone and in combination with aclarubicin (ACLA), a minimally cardiotoxic
anthracycline with equivalent anti-tumor efficacy to DOXO. The combination of bromodomain inhibition (BETi)
with ACLA will be investigated as a priority in both mouse and zebrafish. Anti-tumor efficacy will be specifically
evaluated in mice and cardiotoxicity will be assessed in both animal models. Demonstration of added anti-
neoplastic activity in the absence of added cardiotoxicity will support advancing BETi plus ACLA to clinical trials
for patients with relapsed EwS. Beyond BETi, this proposal will take advantage of large-scale screening in
zebrafish to systematically test a large epigenetic small molecule library for cardiotoxicity in combination with
anthracyclines. By cross-validating the activities of epigenetic compounds in our two in vivo models, we will
accelerate the path to clinical trials and increase the likelihood that new potential drug therapies will have less
cardiotoxicity and increased impact for patients."
10816729,"Project Summary
Macrophages play paradoxical roles in cancer: They can be tumoricidal, but in many cancers, macrophages
promote metastasis. There has been growing evidence that macrophages can modulate cell behavior via
unconventional cell contact-mediated communication in development and homeostasis. We have recently
extended these paradigms by discovering that macrophages can also engage in unconventional cell contact-
mediated communication with tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment, and that these interactions
contribute to metastasis. By visualizing and manipulating highly migratory melanoma cells and their
microenvironment in vivo, we unexpectedly found that tumor-associated macrophages transfer cytoplasmic
contents to melanoma cells in a cell contact-dependent manner. Remarkably, 70-80% of melanoma cells that
received macrophage cytoplasm disseminated from the primary tumor in both zebrafish and murine models.
We are now ideally positioned to identify key component(s) that are transferred from macrophages to tumor
cells for metastasis, and how this transfer occurs. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that perform a variety
of essential cellular functions. Mitochondria have been shown to transfer to tumor cells in vivo, restoring their
respiration and ability to form tumors. While these elegant “proof of principle” studies demonstrated that
mitochondrial lateral transfer can occur in the tumor microenvironment, the donor stromal cell(s) were not
identified, the transfer mechanism was not defined, and the fates and functions of mitochondria in tumor cells
were not characterized. Excitingly, we have found that primary human macrophages can transfer mitochondria
to human breast cancer cells and melanoma cells, two cancers in which macrophages have been shown to
play a pro-tumorigenic role. Tumor cells that receive macrophage mitochondria either by spontaneous
mitochondrial transfer in coculture, or by direct injection of purified macrophage mitochondria, exhibit increased
proliferation. Surprisingly, we find that after mitochondrial transfer occurs, the transferred mitochondria remain
as a spatially distinct population from the host mitochondrial network. Furthermore, we found that high levels of
local reactive oxygen species accumulate at transferred mitochondria, suggesting an intriguing hypothesis that
transferred mitochondria may provide a signal to tumor cells, rather than providing excess mitochondrial
function as has been previously described. To test this hypothesis, we propose to: (Aim 1) Understand how
mitochondria dynamically reorganize for mitochondrial transfer to tumor cells and (Aim 2) Determine how
mitochondrial transfer mechanistically induces cancer cell proliferation. Taken together, these experiments will
reveal whether macrophage mitochondrial transfer can instruct breast cancer and melanoma cells to become
more robust and metastatic. Our goals are to define how immune cells function in the tumor microenvironment,
and to provide a basis for developing future immunotherapies that limit metastasis."
10816397,"Project Summary
In Columbus Ohio’s Linden neighborhood, a historically segregated and disinvested community that has been
devastated by decades of discriminatory race-based policies, infant mortality rates (IMR) are over 20 deaths per
1,000 live births (2%) with racial disparity ratios nearing three. Researchers have linked infant mortality and poor
birth outcomes to maternal education, maternal experiences of stress and discrimination, pove rty, lack of access
to healthy foods, lack of stable housing, and lack of access to prenatal/medical care. These risk factors are
concentrated in majority minority neighborhoodsdue to historical and contemporary policies and practices rooted
in structural racism (e.g., redlining, restrictive covenants, unfavorable zoning) that segregated both people and
resources within communities. Linden is apredominately Black (63%) neighborhood with apopulation of 180,000
residents, of which approximately 45% live below the federal poverty level. Building on Nationwide Children’s
Hospital’s (NCH) history of housing and community development through its Health Neighborhoods/Healthy
Families community partnership on the city’s south side, NCH targeted re-investments in Linden are intended to
improve housing quality and affordability, educational outcomes, access to healthcare, economic development,
and social connections of residents. Informed by Life Course Theory (LCT), the objective of this proposal is
to describe discriminatory policies influencing IMR and other maternal and child health experiences and
outcomes across generations of Black women and importantly, demonstrate how community re-investment can
be designed to target and rectify historic and contemporary structural racism and discrimination. Specifically,
we aim to: (1) examine the experiences of multiple generations of Black women on the intersection of structural
racism and reproductive health through the lens of historical and contemporary policies that effect
communities; (2) conduct real-time formative evaluation of a targeted community investment initiative explicitly
informed by the community’s history of structural racism; and (3) measure relative changes in short term infant
and maternal health disparities in the target community and a statistically matched comparison geography."
10816399,"In 2018, 266,120 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected. The Breast Cancer and Environment
Research Program, funded by NIEHS and NCI, identified a need to better understand environmental
exposures to inform cancer prevention efforts. Further, Just in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) employ
temporal and spatial cues to prompt behavior change, but little is known about spatial predictors of behaviors
at the minute level and beyond home neighborhoods. Two successful weight loss trials in women at risk for
breast cancer, conducted in harmony under the NCI-funded Transdisciplinary Research and Energetics in
Cancer Center, offer a unique opportunity to examine the health impacts of changing environmental exposures
in a heterogeneous sample. One trial focused on older breast cancer survivors, the other on women across
the age range at increased breast cancer risk due to their obesity status. The studies included numerous
identical measures at baseline and 6 months, including biomarkers, GPS and accelerometer measurements,
and perceived environment surveys. We propose to investigate the relationship between minute level objective
GIS measured walkability, greenspace, pollution and food environments and changes in BMI, physical activity
(PA), and cancer related biomarkers. Few studies have assessed the impact of the built environment on weight
loss interventions using objective daily measures, and none included biomarkers of cancer risk. Further, no
studies have employed novel GPS measures of total environment exposure that can change as behaviors
change in an intervention. Assessing the effects of built environments on intervention outcomes and
investigating changes in exposure over time will provide more causal evidence to inform the policy agenda.
Most data on built environment and health are cross sectional. We need longitudinal, causal evidence to
support policy changes in urban design that will have lasting impact on large population groups and those at
risk, recommended by the WHO, IOM and CDC. In addition, we will use estimates of exposure change from
the current study to simulate the potential impact of JITAIs and to identify decision points, decision rules and
tailoring variables for future interventions. The current study will geocode each GPS coordinate (42 million),
integrate built environment data on walkability, greenspace, pollution and food environments in GIS using
validated integrated data analysis techniques, and investigate whether the environment influences changes in
biomarkers, BMI and PA. The Ecological model posits that factors at the individual, interpersonal, and
community level can influence behavior and health. These analyses will assess the multi-level predictors, while
adjusting for interpersonal and individual covariates. Results will be disseminated to existing community
partners from cancer, aging and transportation planning to inform local advocacy efforts. This study will also
inform future RCTs controlling for individual and environmental predictors at baseline and inform JITAIs by
developing and testing minute level spatial, temporal and behavioral rules."
10817191,"ABSTRACT – CANCER BIOLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGY (CBI) PROGRAM
Overview and Goals: The goals of the Cancer Biology and Immunology (CBI) program are to identify basic
mechanisms of cancer cell biology and the immune response in order to develop novel therapeutic approaches
to treat cancer. In particular, CBI members are interested in the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms
controlling tumor and immune cell function, the impact of metabolism and metabolites on tumor and immune cell
biology, and the role of the microenvironment in tumor biology and immune activity. Research Highlights: CBI
investigators recently showed that the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is an important target in both Acute Myeloid
Leukemia (AML) and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML). Targeting CXCR4 on AML promotes oxidative stress
and terminal differentiation of leukemic stem cells (Cell Rep. 20201), whereas blockade of CXCL12 combined
with tyrosine kinase inhibitors eliminates CML stem cells (Cell Stem Cell 20192). CBI investigators also defined
how metabolites influence tumor and immune cell activities: tumor-derived L-2-hydroxyglutarate influences renal
cancer progression and prognosis (Clin. Cancer Res. 20183), and alpha-ketoglutarate regulates the
differentiation and function of CD4 T cells (Immunity 20174). Mechanistic discoveries by CBI investigators have
led to therapeutics that are now being tested in clinical trials, including a heparanase inhibitor for multiple
myeloma (Haematologica 20185) and a DNMT1 inhibitor for MDS and AML (NCT04167917). Program
Activities: CBI catalyzes intra- and inter-programmatic interactions via monthly meetings, annual retreats, and
seminars. Technology forums introduce members to new and existing capabilities of the Shared Resources, and
members' discoveries are advanced from the bench to Phase I clinical trials through pilot funding from the
Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance and the O'Neal Invests program. Members: CBI has 57 members from 16
Departments/Divisions who have a combined $5.2M in NCI funding and $10.1M in total cancer-relevant, peer-
reviewed grants. In the current cycle, CBI members published 693 cancer-relevant publications, of which 39%
were inter-programmatic and 23% were intra-programmatic collaborations and 18% of which are in journals with
impact factor of 9 or greater. Future Directions: In line with the O'Neal strategic plan, CBI will focus on the role
of obesity and metabolism in regulating cancer progression and the anti-tumor immune response. Of the 13
cancers linked with obesity, CBI investigators already have strength in tumor biology and anti-tumor immunity in
multiple myeloma, renal, breast, and ovarian cancers, and we expect that these efforts will lead to collaborative,
multi-PI grants in the next funding period. These cancers overlap with those being targeted by our Community
Outreach and Engagement office, in part due to their relevance to the catchment area. Finally, CBI members will
leverage imaging techniques developed by ET to follow tumor cell activity and immune cell reactivity in situ."
10817193,"ABSTRACT – EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS (ET) PROGRAM
Overview and Goals: The ET Program is the major translational/clinical research engine of the O'Neal with the
goals of identifying novel targets and developing new imaging techniques that can inform innovative therapeutic
strategies and provide cancer patients with an enhanced opportunity for improved survival, increased freedom
from disease progression, and improved quality of life. Research Highlights: Discovery of new pre-clinical
targets such as LIMK2 and PAK4, their in vivo validation in pre-clinical models and medicinal chemistry efforts to
develop clinical grade inhibitors to these targets will provide novel therapeutic opportunities for triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC) and bladder cancer patients, with direct implications for other cancer types in our catchment
area. Advances in imaging markers of patient response to immunotherapies, including hypoxia and granzyme B,
have led to clinical trials in breast cancer, melanoma, and non-small cell lung cancer, all of which are of importance
in our catchment area. Successful inter- and intra-programmatic collaborative bench to bedside efforts continue
to result in clinical translation, including novel combinations with EGFR and PARP inhibition in TNBC or EGFR
and DNA repair checkpoint inhibition in head and neck cancer. Program Activities: ET co-leaders work closely
with O'Neal leadership to enable intra- and inter-programmatic collaborations through program activities
enhanced by SPORE (Cervical cancer; P50 CA098252) and P01 funding (Cancer Prevention; P01 CA210946),
significant collaborations with Southern Research through the Alabama Drug Discovery Alliance, and
partnerships with industry. Strong collaborations with national consortia have continued, including the NCI NCTN
Lead Academic Partnership Site grant (UG1 CA233330) and the Translational Breast Cancer Research
Consortium. Members: The program has 60 members from 14 departments and 3 schools. NCI funding is $3.6M,
cancer-relevant, peer-reviewed funding is $7.8M, and total cancer-relevant funding is $23M. 2,065 patients were
enrolled in therapeutic trials over the current CCSG cycle, including 12% to investigator-initiated trials, 31% to
pilot/Phase I studies, 10% to Phase I/II trials, and 37% to Phase III trials. The program had 1,123 publications
over the current CCSG cycle including 34% inter-programmatic, 24% intra-programmatic, 68% resulting from
collaborations with other institutions, and 13% in journals with an impact factor of 9 or greater. Future Directions:
We plan to enhance current strengths in O'Neal cross-cutting research themes as laid out in the strategic plan,
namely obesity and metabolism in cancer, cancer immunology, imaging, target identification and therapeutic
development. We will work with the office of Community Outreach and Engagement to leverage recent support
e.g., Bridge the Transdisciplinary Cancer Research Continuum supplement (P30 CA013148-48S6), CATCH-UP
ETCTN supplement (P30 CA013148-48S3), Genentech AIR grant, and institutional infrastructure to bring the
newest innovative cancer treatments to the underserved population of Alabama."
10817196,"ABSTRACT - NEURO-ONCOLOGY (NO) PROGRAM
Overview and Goals: The long-term goal of the O’Neal Neuro-Oncology (NO) Program is to develop safe and
innovative therapies for adult and pediatric patients with brain cancer through translation of laboratory research
into safe and innovative clinical trials. To achieve this goal, NO emphasizes strategies to overcome treatment
resistance, addresses the challenges of the central nervous system, tumor microenvironment, and designs
creative therapies to overcome immunosuppression. Research Highlights: A significant effort has been the
deployment and enhancement of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) to create an immunologically active
tumor microenvironment in both pediatric and adult patients. Preclinical studies supported by ANIM, FLOW,
GEN, and TPRO have led to investigator initiated clinical trials. The use of the first-generation oHSV, G207, in
pediatric recurrent malignant glioma patients demonstrates lasting responses and biological confirmation of
immunological activation within the tumor (NEJM, 2021). Program Activities: NO has strong research and
educational programs that strengthen translational neuro-oncology research. The monthly Brain Tumor Working
Group reviews proposed clinical trials and discusses the progress of investigator-initiated trials as well as NO
translational initiatives. NO Seminar enables monthly seminars from guest speakers to share their most recent
research. Monthly Neuro-Oncology Faculty Grants club provides early-stage and senior scientists with the
opportunity to discuss planned grant submissions. NO Retreat also permits strategic planning for the future of
the Program. Trainees and faculty have additional opportunities to share their work and build collaborations
through the Brain Tumor Research in Progress Meeting and Glial Biology Works in Progress Meeting. Members:
NO is composed of 21 highly collaborative members across 8 departments in the School of Medicine. In the
current cycle, NO members have published 243 manuscripts, with 67% being inter-institutional, 42% inter-
programmatic, and 27% intra-programmatic. 20% were in high-impact journals. The program has a total of 54
funded projects totaling $6 million in direct costs, including 15 from the NCI with $2.9 million per year in direct
costs. This external funding is built from strong O’Neal support via NO Program Activities and direct interactions
with ET, CBI, and CCPS. Future Directions: We will build on our recent success with oncolytic HSV to determine
predictors and enhancers of therapeutic response. Investigator Initiated Trials will be designed to test the efficacy
of early deployment of oncolytic HSV in newly diagnosed pediatric and adult malignant glioma patients. We will
apply institutional expertise in imaging to characterize novel PET tracers relevant to our therapeutic development
in both metastatic and primary brain cancers. Innovative proton-based radiation therapy regimens will be
developed for brain metastases which we believe will assist with preserving cognitive function. Environmental
factors for increased glioma risk in our catchment area will be elucidated."
10817198,"ABSTRACT – CANCER CONTROL AND POPULATION SCIENCES (CCPS) PROGRAM
Overview and Goals: The cancer burden in Alabama exceeds that of the US, largely due to poverty and
prevalent risk factors (e.g., obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, low HPV vaccination) and is higher
among rural, Non-Hispanic Black, and select immigrant populations. The CCPS Program goal is to advance high
impact, paradigm-shifting, multidisciplinary translational research across the cancer continuum to reduce the
cancer burden in our catchment area and beyond. Research Highlights: For primary prevention, CCPS
members developed and tested a culturally relevant intervention that increased HPV vaccination rates among
daughters of LatinX immigrants and partnered with the Alabama Department of Public Health to increase HPV
vaccination rates from 35 to 50 percent in one year. In cancer patients and survivors, CCPS study teams tested
and translated innovative strategies to promote medication adherence for dissemination in the Children’s
Oncology Group and promoted safe weight loss as well as improved diet and physical activity in rural, minorities
with obesity in a P01 project. CCPS members, experts in palliative care, disseminated an evidence based, end
of life intervention to 45 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers nationwide, and are adapting interventions to address
caregivers in rural Alabama and in 48 National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program
practices. Program Activities: CCPS research is catalyzed by bidirectional communication with the Office of
Community Outreach and Engagement, Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination office, intra- and
inter-programmatic subgroups, seminars, retreats, internal scientific peer-review and informal chaperoning of
transdisciplinary collaborations. Integral support is provided by Shared Resources (70% utilized by CCPS
members) and the O’Neal Invests Program ($638K from 14 pilot awards leveraged $2.4M in extramural funding).
The UAB-Tuskegee-Morehouse School of Medicine partnership and collaborations with other university centers
(e.g., Nutrition and Obesity Research Center, and Transdisciplinary Health Disparities Research Center)
facilitate our research that targets cancer disparities. Collectively, this support was integral to the awards that
drive our program goal, e.g., 1 P01, 3 U01s and 29 collaborative R01’s. Members: CCPS members include 36
faculty from 13 Departments and 5 Schools, who obtained a total of $8.2M annual program peer-reviewed direct
costs (2021) including a 22% increase in NCI funding ($5.1M). CCPS members are highly productive and
collaborative, as shown by its (704) cancer-focused publications in the current CCSG cycle (2016-2021), of
which 29% were intra-programmatic, 30% inter-programmatic, 77% inter-institutional, and 10% in journals with
an impact factor ≥ 9.0. Future Directions: We contribute to, and are guided by, the O’Neal Strategic Plan, and
have set benchmarks to advance and translate discoveries in cancer prevention and detection, obesity and
cancer, and mitigating morbidity and mortality after cancer."
10817200,"ABSTRACT - COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT (COE)
The O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center (O’Neal) catchment area (CA) is the state of Alabama (AL). This
geographic region includes 67 counties (29 metro, 22 non-metro urban, 16 non-metro rural) and is home to
over 4.9 million residents. The population includes 65.5% non-Hispanic Whites, 26.6% non-Hispanic Blacks,
4.3% Hispanic, 1.4% Asian, 0.5% American Indian or Alaskan Native, 0.05% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific
Islanders, and 1.9% 2 or more races. More than 41% of the population lives in a rural community and 59% live
in a medically underserved area. AL has the 8th highest overall cancer mortality burden in the US. Cancer
mortality varies by county, with only six of 67 counties with a cancer mortality rate at or below the US average.
Cancer mortality also varies by race/ethnicity and rural residence. As such, O’Neal targets seven cancers (lung,
breast, prostate, colorectal, cervical, brain, and multiple myeloma) based on higher cancer incidence and/or
mortality and/or significant racial/ethnic and geographic disparities. Baskin CCPS Associate Director for
Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) leads the integration of COE into all aspects of O’Neal including
the four research programs, clinical care, and overall strategic planning. COE is informed by a Community
Advisory Board (CAB) of demographically diverse members across the CA and a Community Engagement
Committee (CEC) including members of the O’Neal Board, UAB Health System, and Program Leaders. These
groups help insure that the needs of our diverse stakeholders are considered in program development and
decision-making. The Office of COE includes 28 FTEs and is organized into four primary areas: outreach and
education, prevention and care navigation, community-engaged research support, and community needs
assessment and evaluation. Specific aims are: (1) Understand the unique characteristics and needs of our CA;
(2) Promote and support collaborative and cross-disciplinary research to address cancer disparities; and (3)
Implement evidence-based practices to reduce cancer burden among in our CA and beyond. To achieve these
aims, we leverage our long-standing community-engaged infrastructure and collaborate with local, state,
regional, and national organizations to advance policies and practices to decrease cancer burden and eliminate
cancer disparities. COE impact over the current CCSG cycle is evident in our expanded reach (community
members, patients, partnerships); increased navigation to breast, cervical, and lung cancer screening;
increased minority clinical trial accrual; and increased collaboration on catchment-relevant research. Going
forward, we will: enhance our CA needs assessment; further the integration of COE into O’Neal research
programs and the CSL; increase coordination of efforts to increase diversity of patients and clinical trial
participants; and increase outreach and engagement to other marginalized groups (e.g., Latinx, LGBTQ+)."
10817204,"ABSTRACT - DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS
The Developmental Funds of the CCSG represent a vital component of O’Neal because they empower the
Director to respond to, and provide leadership for, the strategic scientific needs and priorities of O’Neal. Funds
from other non-CCSG sources are leveraged to recruit new faculty; therefore, O’Neal Developmental Funds will
be used only for its pilot grants through the O’Neal Invests Program. This mechanism is critical for fostering a
vibrant research environment, allowing Members to test innovative ideas and gather preliminary data for
submission of extramural grants. Our emphasis is on promoting inter- and intra-programmatic collaborative
translational research and to provide seed funding for R01s and multi-project grants such as SPOREs and P01s.
In addition, each year O’Neal supplements four early-stage investigator grants that are primarily funded by our
American Cancer Society Institutional Research Grant. The recipients of our pilot grants have an excellent track
record of obtaining successful grant funding and have added to the scientific growth of our programs. During
the current CCSG cycle, $2.8M in Development funds were allocated to O’Neal including $0.77M to developing
shared resources ,and $2.1M to pilot grants with an ROI of $7.33:1.
In 2020, Sleckman CBI revamped our pilot grant program. All funding from small donors, as well as foundations
(i.e., Breast Cancer Research Foundation of Alabama, the Mike Slive Foundation for Prostate Cancer Research),
and Developmental Funds are now combined into one the O’Neal Invests Program (OIP). This allowed us to
increase the amount of each Pre-R01 pilot grant to $80,000 per year, with the possibility of a second year of
funding contingent upon progress made in the first. For pre-P01, pre-SPORE and pre-multi-project grants, the
program provides $250,000 per year with a second year available with demonstration of progress in year one
for a total of $500,000. Our Review Committee and Community Outreach and Engagement Office evaluate all
OIP applications for scientific rigor, alignment with the O’Neal’s research priorities, relevance to our catchment
area, and the potential for extramural funding. Besides growing membership, this encourages researchers from
areas not usually associated with biomedical research, such as physics, synthetic chemistry, and engineering,
to apply their expertise to the field of cancer research. The OIP reviews progress at the end of the first year and
provides an additional $80,000 for projects that have made significant advances. At the end of two years,
awardees are expected to apply for an R01 or a P level grant. With these aims and the OIP in place, O’Neal has
consolidated all of its resources, including the CCSG Development funds, into a highly focused strategically
driven effort to promote the research goals of the Strategic Plan. Development funds will be utilized as an integral
resource to promote meritorious science, attract members to the Center, build productive and successful
collaborative multi-disciplinary teams, and foster the growth of its members."
10817206,"ABSTRACT – SHARED RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
The O'Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center (O'Neal) organizes and supports 12 CCSG-supported Shared
Resources (SRs). The mission of the O'Neal SRs is to enhance and accelerate O'Neal member research through
the provision of specialized expertise as well as high quality services and cutting-edge technologies, which
cannot be afforded by single laboratories, and to provide customized services not easily available through
commercial entities at the same speed and cost-effectiveness. The SRs support all four research programs and
are led by faculty from seven departments. All the SRs are located within a six-block radius of the O'Neal
headquarters and are easily accessible by its members. The specific aims for Shared Resource Management
(SRM) are: 1) Provide access to cutting-edge technologies, specialized services, and world-class expertise in
support of our members' research and the programmatic strategic goals of O'Neal; 2) Ensure the SRs are
effective, efficient, reliable, and responsive to O'Neal member needs through clear and systematic evaluation in
partnership with SR leaders; and 3) Support SR operations with guidance and expertise in budget planning,
laboratory management systems, and to facilitate opportunities in marketing and education. The SRs are led by
Erwin G. Van Meir, PhD, Associate Director for Shared Resources and ultimately report to the O'Neal Director,
Sleckman CBI. Van Meir NO chairs the SRM administrative team comprised of Michael Bertram PhD, MBA,
AD for Administration; Ryan Chambers, JD, MBA, for fiscal and administrative management of the SRs; and Ms.
Laura Gallitz, research administrative associate. Van Meir NO also chairs the O'Neal Scientific Review
Committee (SRC) that steers SR management, development, and scientific vision. The SRC is composed of
program leaders, SR directors, and ADs for administration, basic, and translational science, and has monthly
meetings to identify scientific program needs and coordinate with SR services. Additionally, Van Meir NO
evaluates SR user annual survey results, individual SRs advisory committee recommendations, and bi-annual
O'Neal advisory committee meeting reports to further guide SR development, and monitor service quality and
needs. Moreover, in-depth SR reviews are conducted annually to provide scientific and operational input, and to
identify and address any systemic problems. SR operational oversight includes enforcing O'Neal SR policies
(prioritization of use and access, budgets, billing, and quality control) and verifying compliance with UAB Office
of Research policies and the federal Uniform Guidance regulations. Requests for new instrumentation and
establishment of new SRs are initially presented at the SRC, then a formal written request is made. Based on
the above reports and requests, Van Meir NO makes recommendations as to renewing or terminating existing
SRs and requests for new SRs and instrumentation to the Senior Leadership, and this body further advises the
O'Neal Director for final determination."

The O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center (O’Neal) at the University Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) was one
of the first eight Comprehensive Cancer Centers designated by the NCI in 1972. The State of Alabama is the
catchment area for the O’Neal, and the population of Alabama has significant cancer burdens and disparities.
O’Neal has a long and distinguished history of health disparities research and of implementing the findings of
this research to reduce the cancer burdens in Alabama. In addition, there have been significant accomplishments
in taking O’Neal basic science forward to develop novel prevention, diagnostic, and therapeutic agents. The UAB
campus spans 100 city blocks that hold its 12 schools. This contiguous layout provides important opportunities
for O’Neal to engage expertise at schools not normally focused on the cancer mission. In January 2020, Dr.
Barry Sleckman became the fifth Director of O’Neal. The arrival of Sleckman CBI brought many new important
initiatives and changes. A five-year Strategic Plan was initiated that included over 200 participants, including
faculty from most UAB Schools, community stakeholders, UAB Health System leadership, trainees, and
administration. The strategic planning process was focused on identifying areas of institutional strength that
could be coalesced into thematic multidisciplinary teams aimed at reducing the cancer burden and disparities in
our catchment area. This process identified six thematic areas of research focus for the next five years; 1)
Obesity and Metabolism in Cancer; 2) Cancer Immunology; 3) Cancer Imaging; 4) Target Identification and
Therapeutic Development; 5) Cancer Prevention and Early Detection; and 6) Mitigating Morbidity of Cancer and
its Treatment. Sleckman CBI also restructured the Senior Leadership team, adding two new key Associate
Directors and establishing seven committees focused on important missions of O’Neal. These committees, which
meet regularly, are all chaired by members of senior leadership and include program leaders and O’Neal
members. The committees provide for real-time two-way communication between program members and Senior
Leadership around issues that are critical for advancing our strategic goals. Sleckman CBI also made improving
O’Neal clinical trial processes a top priority, facilitating therapeutic trials to open more rapidly, and allowing for
more cancer patients to be accrued to therapeutic clinical trials. These important changes were brought about
by the findings of a Clinical Trials Task Force, the appointment of an Associate Director for Clinical Research,
and the formation of the Clinical Research Oversight Committee. Together they have already brought about
significant increases in our accrual to therapeutic trials. The new leadership structure and committees put into
place by Sleckman CBI will provide important real-time communication connections between Senior Leadership,
O’Neal members, and our community. This is needed over the next five years to achieve the goals outlined in
Strategic Plan and reduce the most significant cancer burdens and disparities in Alabama.

10817210,"ABSTRACT - CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT (CPDM)
The Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) of the O'Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center (O'Neal)
maintains the highest standards of clinical investigation that are aligned with all university, state, and federal
regulations, while assisting investigators in protocol development and all aspects related to clinical investigation.
The CPDM is responsible for the following significant functions: 1) coordination, tracking, and reporting of all
cancer clinical research activity undertaken at O'Neal, 2) continuous improvement of the clinical trial activation
process, 3) ongoing education and training of clinicians and clinical research staff, 4) clinical trial data quality
monitoring, 5) cancer clinical trial participant safety, and 6) actively ensuring all sections of the population
represented in the O'Neal catchment area have the opportunity to be represented in cancer clinical trials. The
O'Neal Clinical Trials Office (CTO) supports cancer treatment trials by providing regulatory services, financial
management, recruitment of participants, clinical coordination, and data management. The CTO houses a
specialized investigator-initiated trial (IIT) support team focused on protocol development, multi-site coordination,
project management, and sponsor-level interactions with regulatory agencies. During the current CCSG cycle,
there was an early decline in clinical trial activity. With establishment of new leadership in 2020 multiple
interventions were put in place to increase overall accrual to treatment trials, foster the development of IITs,
reduce overall time to protocol activation, and guide clinical trial activities to fit the cancer burden in Alabama.
There were 12,861 accruals to interventional trials, including 2,261 accruals to treatment trials in the period, with
a 13% increase in yearly accrual to treatment trials in 2020 when compared to 2019, in an upward trajectory that
continues in 2021. The Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) provides independent oversight of all
clinical trials sponsored by O'Neal investigators to ensure safety of participants and integrity of data generated.
The DSMC employs a risk-based classification of trials matched with different levels and scopes of audits and
data review. During the current CCSG cycle, the DSMC oversaw an average of 88 trials at any given time, and
performed 43 full audits/year. In coordination with our Office of Community Outreach and Engagement (OCOE),
we have expanded efforts towards increased representation of women and racial-ethnical minorities in O'Neal
trials. In the current CCSG cycle, 57% of participants in O'Neal treatment trials were women, and 21% were
minorities. Efforts to increase minority participation include the maintenance of a lay navigator clinical trial
facilitation program, award of a CATCH-UP 2020 ETCTN administrative supplement, and establishment of
strategic collaboration with health systems serving under-resourced populations. We maintain a strong
commitment to expanding cancer clinical research to all patients across the lifespan with establishment of a
Cancer and Aging program and an Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer program."
10817212,"ABSTRACT – PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM (PRMS)
The protocol review and monitoring system (PRMS) for the O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center (O’Neal)
ensures that clinical cancer research performed at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) has scientific
merit, is aligned with the priorities of the center, and progresses timely to yield relevant results. Fifteen disease
working groups (DWGs) form the foundation of PRMS and serve as the primary setting for interface with the
center research programs and the first step of scientific review of protocols. DWGs facilitate protocol
development and perform scientific and feasibility review for internally and externally sourced clinical protocols.
During the current project period, the DWGs reviewed 857 and approved 643 (75%) clinical protocols. Clinical
protocols approved by the DWGs proceed for review by the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC),
the second step of scientific review. The PRMC is composed of two co-chairs, administrative staff, and 17 core
members representing several disciplines relevant to clinical cancer research. Following strict criteria, protocols
undergo expedited review by co-chairs or full board review. The PRMC has final authority on protocol approval
or rejection. While the PRMC and UAB’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) are independent with no overlapping
membership, PRMC scientific approval is required for IRB approval. During the current project period, the PRMC
reviewed 694 protocols, including 410 protocols that underwent full committee review. The PRMC oversees the
progress of approved protocols towards their accrual goals. Following a well-established set of criteria, PRMC
flags protocols for remediation when not meeting accrual goals and, in the event of inadequate improvement,
determines the closure of protocols. In the current CCSG cycle, 300 protocols required PI action due to
insufficient accrual. In 250 protocols, an adequate correction action plan was implemented while 50 were
eventually closed by determination of the PRMC. The PRMS is supported by administrative staff that ensures
uniform and consistent operation of DWGs and the PRMC, documentation of activities, and communication with
investigators and research teams. Several important changes were implemented in the PRMS during the current
period, including standardization of DWG activities, transition to fully electronic protocol management,
implementation of virtual meetings, and establishment of dedicated administrative support. Operational
improvements can be exemplified by the reduction in time from PRMC submission to determination (from median
of 47 to 26 days). Future plans include increasing the interaction between DWGs and O’Neal research programs
and aligning the DWGs with the Cancer Service Line to ensure synchrony between research priorities and clinical
operations."
10817223,"Core A: Administrative Core
Project Summary/Abstract
The UCI ADRC Administrative Core provides administrative support and oversight, strong innovative
leadership, and orchestrates the integration and centeredness with the cores of the Center (Clinical, Data
Management and Statistical, Neuropathology, Outreach Recruitment and Engagement, Induced Pluripotent
Stem Cell, Biomarker, Down Syndrome and 90+), and the Research Education Component (REC). The broad
theme of the UCI ADRC is “to identify, quantify, and validate factors that influence the risk of AD across the
lifespan.” Beyond attending to the administrative details of the Center, the Administrative Core focuses on five
broad activities that have a significant impact on our overall vitality and productivity: promote centeredness,
engage and recruit new faculty, facilitate AD research, ensure that our researchers have state-of-the-art
facilities, and actively engage in philanthropy. The UCI ADRC Administrative Core supports the broad goals of
our ADRC as we perform basic and targeted clinical studies into the mechanisms of dementia and builds on
our rich history in neurobiology research into age-related cognitive decline and AD. Maintaining a highly
functioning and efficient Center enables the Administrative Core to foster innovation in AD research, facilitate
collaborations (including core-to-core interactions and within the ADRC network), and support the education of
the next generation of scientists, clinicians, and members of our community. The Administrative Core
facilitates the Center's overall goals of collaboration, innovation, and education, and promotes the National
Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA) research implementation milestones and goals. The Administrative Core
capitalizes on opportunities to grow our Center and played a major role in recruiting ten new faculty to the
ADRC over the past four years, many of whom are leaders in their subdiscipline and have become leaders of
one of the Cores in the Center. The leaders of the Administrative Core are deeply committed and devote a
significant amount of time to ensure that our Center is successful and cutting-edge. The active engagement of
the Administrative Core leadership has helped to transform our Center over the past several years by
promoting innovation and new ideas, such as the establishment of our novel Special Populations Cores (Down
Syndrome Core and 90+ Core), our new participant recruitment registry (Consent-to-Contact, C2C), and our
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) Core."
10817227,"PROJECT SUMMARY – NEUROPATHOLOGY CORE (CORE D)
The UCI ADRC Neuropathology (NP) Core provides autopsy, diagnostic, and biorepository services for the
three cohorts of the UCI ADRC - Uniform Data Set (UDS), 90+, and Down syndrome - which span a broad
range of ages and susceptibilities to AD. The overarching goal of the NP Core is to support education,
outreach, and research on AD and related disorders (ADRD) in collaboration with other ADRC cores and
ADRD researchers to “identify, quantify, and validate factors that influence the risk of AD across the lifespan.”
Since its inception, the NP Core has collected and maintained a considerable bank of high-quality
biospecimens, which have been distributed broadly to NCRAD and federally-funded local, national, and
international ADRD investigators and consortia. Core operations have been continually enhanced, and metrics
of core performance are strong. To expand its capacity, three new faculty have joined the NP Core, including a
neuropathologist who is also a REC mentee (Mari Perez-Rosendahl). Together with the other UCI ADRC
Cores, the NP Core proposes six Aims to enhance its diagnostic, education, and research functions via
collaboration, innovation, and education: 1) Provide accurate, timely, comprehensive, and standardized
postmortem examinations and diagnostic reports on UDS subjects and special populations, including the
addition of postmortem skin collection on selected cases in collaboration with the iPSC Core; 2) Harvest,
process, store, catalog, and distribute high-quality brain tissue and biospecimens to ADRD researchers at UCI
and beyond, collaborating with the DMS and Biomarker Cores in its data management and biospecimen
utilization functions; 3) Incorporate new analysis methods to enable novel microglial studies by UCI
investigators at the cutting-edge of a new microglial biology in AD; 4) Incorporate whole slide imaging (WSI) to
facilitate diagnoses, research, and education, including the establishment of interfaces with a UC-wide WSI
network and UCI artificial intelligence (AI) center; 5) Support novel ADRD research and outreach in
collaboration with other UCI ADRC Cores and other ADRCs, including new studies involving postmortem MRI,
light sheet microscopy of cleared brain tissues, and AI studies of WSIs; and 6) Contribute unique expertise to
the education and training of the next generation of AD clinicians and researchers, including Dr. Perez-
Rosendahl, neuropathologist and REC mentee."
10822663,"Abstract:
Vulnerable and underserved populations such as ethnic and racial minorities, the poor, the LGBTQ community
and those with physical or intellectual disabilities, often suffer the greatest health risks while facing significant
barriers to receiving healthcare. While biological and clinical risks influence outcomes, sociocultural and
socioeconomic factors also create major barriers to receiving healthcare services, at an individual, community
and population level for these populations. These social determinants of health (SDOH), such as transportation,
literacy, and finances, can severely limit participation in health programs designed for the general population.
Diabetes Prevention Programs (DPP) are a good example of a lifestyle change protocol that is proven to reduce
the risk of type 2 diabetes by half for at-risk pre-diabetic patients by encouraging weight-loss. But, despite the
effectiveness of the program, more than 50% of participants drop out before completing this year-long lifestyle
change program, severely limiting the program’s success. This is in part due to the fact that programs like DPP
take little account of the SDOH limitations faced by underserved and vulnerable populations that it is meant to
help. This lack of support at the individual and community level combined with the fact that healthcare institutions
are not designed for, nor economical, in supporting patient health outside the medical facility where it is most
needed. This creates a gap in healthcare service that current systems cannot overcome. Viora is closing this
health services gap with a digital wraparound system that extends care management workflows at healthcare
organizations by engaging underserved patients at home to facilitate better outcomes in programs like DPP. By
using risk stratification based on SDOH and lifestyle factors, each DPP participant can have tailored interventions
that consider their socioeconomic and sociocultural characteristics. The Viora TIPS system uses a simple 2-way
communication to interface between patients, coaches, health providers, and underutilized community services,
facilitating and supporting patient self-management and completion of the DPP program. In Phase I, Viora Health
completed work followed by a human subject study with underserved subjects and community-based partners.
Completion of Phase I demonstrated feasibility of Viora system prototype and collected feedback to improve
system components. In Phase II, Viora will automate and integrate features from the Phase I work to provide
automated on-boarding based on risk stratification models completed in Phase I, to facilitate a more effective
personal intervention plans; automate distribution of personalized content during the DPP program, and track
progress on closing SDOH gaps. The completed system will then be evaluated in a case controlled human
subject study of a minority population participating in a DPP program. This work will be the final step before a
minimum viable product can be released to the market for commercialization."
10818151,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The severe genetic disorder Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) causes tumor growth throughout the nervous
system due to lack of expression of the tumor suppressor protein Merlin. These tumors cause progressive,
debilitating neurological symptoms, including pain, nerve dysfunction, deafness, paralysis, vision problems,
and balance disruption, leading to a substantially shortened lifespan of approximately 36 years. The
socio-economic burden of this disease and the physical and psychological toll on patients and families remain
devastating since current treatment options (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation) do not work on the majority
of patients and have severe side effects. There are currently no FDA-approved treatment options available for
NF2 patients. To address this unmet need, Merlin Therapeutics is developing an adeno-associated viral vector
9 (AAV9) gene therapy expressing a healthy copy of the NF2 coding sequencing under the control of a
truncated but functional NF2 promoter sequence. This gene therapy approach is unique because it is designed
to allow the expression of the Merlin protein in all cell types affected by the disease at adequate levels.
Extensive preliminary studies compared multiple promoter constructs and showed that the therapeutic lead
vector is efficacious in delivering the Merlin protein and rescuing tumor characteristics in vitro in patient
Schwann cell lines carrying multiple different NF2 mutations and in primary human vestibular schwannoma
cells isolated from a patient tumor sample. Moreover, intratumoral injections of the treatment successfully
reduced tumor growth in a schwannoma xenograft mouse model in vivo. The objective of the current project is
to validate the existing preliminary data and gather additional information on dose-response and safety, as well
as confirm promoter activity and biodistribution of the lead gene therapy candidate in a in larger animal species
(pigs) more closely related to humans. This study fills gaps in the next steps towards translation of this
therapeutic approach to clinic. Upon completion, our Phase II application will aim to support IND-enabling large
animal safety studies. Our long-term goal is to develop a product that provides an effective and safe treatment
to NF2 patients by treating the underlying disease cause and potentially also a broader cancer patient
population who urgently need better therapeutic options."
10818179,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pathogenic copy number variants (pCNVs) are strongly associated with neurodevelopmental and
neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia, yet identifying the genes or
combinations of genes within pCNVs that drive syndromic phenotypes remains a central challenge. Cumulative
data from our team and others has shown that the 3q29 deletion is associated with a high neurodevelopmental
and neuropsychiatric illness burden, including a 40-fold increase in schizophrenia risk. We identified reduced
cerebellar volume as a core phenotype that correlates with greater phenotypic severity including lower IQ.
However, the individual genes driving these phenotypes remain unknown. In this proposal, we will use a highly
innovative approach that capitalizes on the unique features of zebrafish to rapidly screen the function of genes
and combinations of genes in the 3q29 deletion in the developing vertebrate brain. Our central goal is to identify
the driver genes and/or gene combinations that are associated with neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Our
central hypothesis is that individual driver genes in the 3q29 deletion interval act alone or in smaller subsets to
cause reduction in cerebellar volume, growth deficits, and behavioral dysfunction. This hypothesis is based on
accumulating evidence supporting the presence of driver genes for specific phenotypes in pCNVs, as well as
the high expression level of multiple genes in the 3q29 interval in the cerebellum. To test this hypothesis, we will
perform in vivo screens of individual 3q29 genes in zebrafish using a novel CRISPR-F0 method that allows us
to rapidly assess the effects of gene loss of function. We will assess the consequences of loss of function of
individual genes on body size, brain structure, and cerebellar volume using a custom whole-brain mapping
pipeline (Aim 1) and basic arousal and sensory processing behaviors using automated, high-throughput assays
(Aim 2), and assess the effect of disrupting combinations of genes on these phenotypes (Aim 3). The expected
outcome of this research is to identify driver genes and/or gene combinations in the 3q29 deletion that contribute
to a range of neurodevelopmental phenotypes. The broader impact of this research is that it will provide a path
forward for the identification of driver genes and gene interactions that is generalizable across pCNVs associated
with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders."
10820418,"In collaboration with the New York Hall of Science (NYSCI), the DNA Learning Center
(DNALC) of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) proposes to develop a Citizen DNA
Barcode Network. The project will organize national campaigns to map the ranges of
species within three groups of insect: ants, mosquitoes, and beetles. These groups
include bioindicators of environmental change, vectors of human disease, and
economically important species whose ranges are being altered by global climate change.
Citizen scientists will use the technique of DNA barcoding, which allows non-experts to
identify almost any insect species, even from larval forms or damaged samples.
The project is based on an integrated biochemical and bioinformatics workflow we have
developed to support DNA barcoding in formal education settings. Our current SEPA
project, Barcode Long Island, has undertaken DNA barcoding campaigns in the formal
education system—with high school students documenting local biodiversity and the
northward range expansion of several insects—novel evidence of global warming.
During the development phase, we will work intensively with NYSCI to refine resources
and dissemination methods to support citizen science in informal settings. In parallel, we
will pilot methods to engage visitors to nature preserves and members of conservation
groups, including The Nature Conservancy and Audubon Society. During the replication
phase, we will onboard three additional science centers and six additional community
conservation groups. Partners will be provided with training, educational materials, mobile
labs, and supplies needed to generate data for insect campaigns and biodiversity surveys
(bioblitzes) of locally important habitats. Mentorship by high school and college faculty with
experience in DNA barcoding and extended collaborative support—including
troubleshooting and data analysis—will help insure success at each site.
Data collected by citizen scientists will contribute to the scientific record in two ways: 1)
Barcode sequences will be published in GenBank, the authoritative DNA database, and to
species-specific databases. 2) Occurrence data will be contributed to the Global
Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) to expand existing range maps. A multi-faceted
evaluation program will develop novel survey instruments to assess the impact of
participation in citizen barcoding projects on attitudes toward biodiversity on global
climate change."
10820491,"Project Summary
The overall goal of this project is to develop a new diagnostic tool, called Cyst-X, for accurate detection and
characterization of pre-cancerous pancreatic cysts and improve patient outcome through precise decisions
(surgical resection or surveillance). Pancreatic cancer is the most fatal cancer among all cancers due to its poor
prognosis and lack of early detection methods. Unlike other common cancers where precursor lesions are well
known (colon polyps-colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors
(cysts) are poorly understood. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages may decrease mortality and
morbidity rates of this lethal disease. One major approach for diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages is
to target pancreatic precancerous pancreatic neoplasms (cysts) before they turn into invasive cancer. Once cysts
are detected with radiology imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they should be characterized
with respect to their malignant potential. Low-risk cysts remain harmless; hence, patients should remain under
surveillance program. On the other hand, high-risk cysts can progress into an aggressive cancer, therefore,
patients should undergo surgical resection if possible. Despite this, international guidelines for risk stratification
of pancreatic cysts are woefully deficient (55-76% accuracy for determining characteristics of low-risk vs high
risk cystic tumors, while only 40-50% accuracy detecting cysts with MRI). Combined, these critical barriers
indicate that there is an urgent need for improving characterization of pancreatic cystic tumors. Based on our
preliminary results, which support the development of an image-based diagnostic decision tool, we hypothesize
that our proposed Cyst-X will produce higher diagnostic accuracy for characterizing pancreatic cysts and provide
better patient management compared to the current guidelines. Towards this overarching hypothesis, we will
first use powerful deep learning methods (specifically deep capsule networks) for automatically detecting and
segmenting the pancreas and pancreatic cysts from multi-sequence MRI scans (Aim 1). Next, we will create an
interpretable image-based diagnosis model for characterizing pancreatic cysts (Aim 2). Accurate
characterization is necessary for such a diagnostic model; however, emphasis will also be placed on
interpretability of the machine generated diagnostic model. Visual explanation of the discriminative features will
help radiologists obtain higher decision rates in patient management. In Aim 3, we will validate the proposed
Cyst-X framework in a multi-center study. A total of 1200 multi-sequence MRI scans will be collected from three
participating clinical centers (Mayo Clinic, Columbia University Medical Center, Erasmus Medical Center).
Comprehensive evaluations will be made to test the validity and generalizability of Cyst-X. All evaluations will be
made with respect to the international guidelines and biopsy proven ground truths. Our proposed study has wide
implications: specifically, in the long term, it will influence early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and clinical
decision making to improve survival rates of pancreatic cancer."
10820893,"A. Summary of parent grant
There is a widespread recognition that mental health is often neglected, under-resourced, and
underfunded, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) 1, 2. Experiencing traumatic
events as a child is often linked to mental health problems and higher levels of stress reactivity and
impact one's entire ecology with long-term intergenerational consequences 3. The treatment gap, is
more than 50% in all countries and can be as high as 90% in the least resourced countries 4. Sierra
Leone is one of many low and middle-income countries (LMICs) that have encountered challenges in
providing mental health services to their population, particularly children and adolescents 5-6. This has
been compounded by the country's experiences of war and the Ebola outbreak. The parent grant for
the proposed supplement is a mixed-method, longitudinal study evaluating the long-term effects of
war and trauma on parents and their relationships with their children, families, and communities.
Previous studies have noted the limitations of relying on self-reported family dynamics in post-
conflict settings, including Sierra Leone 7. There is a need for observational techniques and
instruments that are context-specific, current, biologically based, and tailored to fathers to supplement
self-report methods. The findings from this study will inform the development of decision-support
tools for lay-worker-delivered prevention models to support family interventions to address specific
needs, based on the family's distinct pattern of risk and protective factors.
 Specific Aims of the parent grant: The primary aims of the parent grant are as follows:
 (1) Investigate the biological embedding and long-term mental health consequences of war-related
trauma in a longitudinal sample of war-affected youth who have become parents (N=394).
(2) Examine associations between parental war-related trauma exposure, mental health, and biological
and physiological indicators of emotion, cognition, and social functioning in offspring aged 7–24
(N=410). (3) Identify and examine how modifiable risk and protective factors operate to identify
priority intervention targets to improve the physical and mental health of war-affected children and to
develop screening tools to identify families at risk.

10821430,"Mount Sinai ADRC (Sano): Research Education Component (REC) – Research Summary
The Research Education Component (REC) of the Alzheimer's Research Center (ARC) will provide critically
needed training for junior faculty, senior postdoctoral fellows, and clinical research track residents and
fellows, to conduct research on Alzheimer's disease-related disorders (ADRD). REC will support mentored
research experiences for junior investigators during two vulnerable periods of their career development, early
in their careers as they approach the end of residency or fellowship training, when they are too junior to
obtain career development awards, or later when they have completed a career development award (e.g. K
award), have a junior faculty position, but have yet to obtain RO1 or equivalent grant funding. Through the
participation of distinguished senior faculty mentors in an intellectually and technologically rich academic
environment at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (ISMMS), REC will also provide a mechanism
to support gifted and highly motivated junior investigators who are new to AD research. Complementing
state-of-the-art research training with teams of multidisciplinary REC mentors, REC scholars will receive an
individually tailored didactic curriculum and exposure to multiple career-building activities, including a work-
in-progress seminar series, science communication course, translational neuroscience and AD seminar
series, grant and publication writing workshops and course, an academic survival and leadership seminar
series, optional advanced coursework in neuroscience, genetics/genomics, and quantitative analyses, and
a variety of additional resources available at ISMMS. REC scholars, moreover, will take advantage of well-
designed, accessible ARC cores which will assist in their training allowing timely completion of their research
program milestones and assisting scholars to meet goals set in their individual development plans (IDPs).
REC objectives include: (1) To support trainees to conduct research to test questions and mechanisms
important to the health of ADRD patients; (2) To provide advanced training in approach and
methodologies needed to conduct high quality, ethical, and multidisciplinary research on ADRD disorders;
(3) To provide multidisciplinary mentorship, with at least two interdisciplinary mentors, and an individually
tailored career development plan; (4) To provide multiple forums that will encourage development of
trainee presentation skills. (5) To prepare and assist trainees to submit and obtain external grant funding
that is appropriate for their career stage (e.g. K award for postdocs and clinical fellows, or R21/RO1 for junior
faculty), to sustain long-term academic careers as independent investigators and future leaders in the
basic, translational, and clinical research of ADRDs. REC leadership, mentoring teams, and of course
REC scholars themselves, will work together to closely assess short-term trainee progress and outcomes,
and long-term trainee career development, providing critical metrics to evaluate overall success and guide
future improvement."
10866497,"Complex physical and genetic interaction networks determine the properties of all biological systems and
underlie human development, health and disease. Decades of biological experiments have identified myriad
molecular processes that underpin specific biological processes, described in the primary biomedical literature.
More recent technological innovations combined with complete genome sequence information have led to the
development of a wide variety high-throughput (HTP) methods to generate physical and genetic interaction
data on an unprecedented scale. Because human interaction networks are often directly analogous to
networks in more tractable model organisms, it is essential that the hundreds of thousands of biological
interactions discovered across the major model organisms, as well as humans, are archived in a well-
annotated manner that provides a means for rigorous analysis and computation. To capture, integrate, and
interrogate this wealth of data from both the literature and HTP datasets, we developed the BioGRID database
as an open repository for physical and genetic interactions (www.thebiogrid.org). BioGRID contains over
2,000,000 total interactions from 75,760 publications. In 2020, BioGRID averaged 151,735 page views, 19,407
unique visitors and 7,537 file downloads per month. Our recently released Open Repository for CRISPR
Screens (ORCS), averages 8,725 page views, 1,646 unique visitors, and 268 downloads per month. In
addition, the extensive BioGRID data compendium is widely disseminated by many partner databases, meta-
databases, and software tools. Here, we propose to markedly enhance the data content, the database
architecture, and the user interface of BioGRID. We will expand the amount and types of data available
through BioGRID, with a particular focus on translating knowledge from model organism networks to humans
using ortholog mapping and a novel framework for mapping phenotypes and diseases across species. We will
significantly expand CRISPR-based genetic interactions, chemical and drug interactions, and post-translational
modifications, which we will integrate with our core physical and genetic interactions and organize around
focused curation efforts around particular biological themes. Use of text-mining algorithms and AI methods will
be extended to enhance curation rates and coverage of the proteome. User access to the large datasets in
BioGRID will be facilitated by data-rich interfaces, user-defined search and display parameters, and multiple
methods of visualization. All software will continue to be open source and engineered toward compatibility and
will be complementary with other database and software development efforts. The BioGRID will provide
interaction data and software tools to model organism databases and other interested parties without
restriction. The BioGRID resource will enable the biomedical research community to access validated
biological interaction datasets across model organisms and humans for hypothesis generation and network
analysis, and thereby further the general mission of the NIH."
10821412,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal is for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) for Katherine Balantekin, PhD,
RD. Training: My long-term career goal is to be an independent investigator studying ingestive behavior and
obesity risk factors in children and adolescents with co-morbid overweight/obesity and disordered eating. The
proposed K01 will help achieve this by providing training, experience, and mentorship in the areas of: 1)
identification of novel treatment targets for those with comorbid overweight/obesity and disordered eating; 2)
applying basic behavioral science principles towards understanding ingestive behavior; 3) translating findings
from lab-based studies into interventions; 4) evaluating how behavioral phenotypes influence obesity risk over
time. This K01 will provide me with the protected time to receive the necessary training to enhance my
expertise in these four areas and will propel me to becoming an independent research scientist focused on the
intersection of obesity and disordered eating. Research: Overweight/obesity among children is a major public
health problem, and children with overweight/obesity are at increased risk for both medical and psychological
co-morbidities. Disordered eating begins in childhood, and often manifests as loss of control (LOC) eating,
especially in children with overweight/obesity. Children with LOC eating, or the feeling that one cannot control
what or how much one is eating, are at increased risk for obesity. However, less is known about mechanisms
that increase this risk. Both parental restriction and the relative reinforcing value (RRV) of food, or the
motivation to obtain food, are independently associated with child overweight/obesity, and preliminary work
suggests that both may also be related to the development and/or maintenance of LOC. The proposed K01 is
designed to explore the relationships among LOC eating, exposure to parental restriction, and RRV of food
with respect to obesity risk. Summary: Findings from this study will help identify potential targets for a NIDDK
R03 grant application to pilot the efficacy of an obesity prevention trial for children with disordered eating at risk
for obesity. This K01 will provide me with the training and expertise in identifying behavioral phenotypes for
treatment targets, applying basic behavioral science principles towards understanding ingestive behavior,

Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) revolutionized the treatment and prevention of HIV-1 infection.
However, ART does not eradicate established infection and worldwide HIV-1 incidence rates remain high and
have been declining slowly. Thus, the search for novel preventive and therapeutic interventions remains a high
priority. In recent years, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) emerged as a long-acting alternative to daily
ART and as a promising strategy to achieve long-term treatment-free HIV-1 control. bNAbs differ from ART in
that they engage the host immune system by virtue of their Fc effector domains and therefore have the potential
to mediate killing of infected cells and modulate or enhance HIV-specific immune responses. However, bNAbs
are vulnerable to escape by HIV-1 variants. During HIV-1 infection, antibody responses co-evolve with a large
population of rapidly mutating viruses, such that variants that are resistant to individual antibodies are frequently
encountered. Consistent with this high level of diversity, several clinical studies have demonstrated that bNAb
monotherapy leads to transient declines in viremia with rapid selection of bNAb-resistant viral strains. In contrast,
a combination of two bNAbs targeting non-overlapping Env epitopes maintained viral suppression in participants
harboring antibody sensitive viruses who had achieved viral suppression with ART and subsequently received
repeated doses of bNAbs during ART interruption. These early studies demonstrate the potential therapeutic
application of bNAbs but also highlight the need to better understand viral escape pathways leading to bNAb
resistance. Although resistance to some bNAbs (i.e. anti-V3 loop) is predicated on known features of Env, the
determinants of resistance are poorly defined for other bNAbs and for combinations of bNAbs. The overarching
goals of this proposal are to understand the diversity of pathways leading to bNAb escape and use this
information to guide the design of more effective optimized bNAb combinations that prevent emergence of
resistant variants. This proposal has four interrelated aims directed at accomplishing these goals: (1) Determine
the sequence elements that lead to viral resistance to bNAb administration in humans using newly developed
next generation deep sequencing methods; (2) Systematically map all possible viable bNAb resistance mutations
to identify mechanisms of escape across viral strains and subtypes by producing and testing complete libraries
of Env mutants; (3) Determine the nature of clinically relevant bNAb-resistant HIV-1 variants that can be selected
in cell culture in the presence or absence of autologous serum; (4) Develop computational models that define
mechanisms of HIV-1 bNAb resistance by integrating the sequence information obtained from Aims 1-3."

On February 3, 2023, a Norfolk Southern train carrying hazardous chemicals, including vinyl chloride and butyl
acrylate, derailed in the village of East Palestine, Ohio. Nearly half of the local 4,800 residents were evacuated
within hours. A subsequent controlled combustion of five tankers was undertaken, resulting in the release of
phosgene and hydrogen chloride into the atmosphere. While initial air sampling did not show evidence of vinyl
chloride or hydrogen chloride concentrations above air quality standards, testing is ongoing. Contaminated run
off was detected in two surface water streams. This has had significant ecologic impact — more than 40,000
fish deaths were identified within a 5 mile radius of the site in the days following the derailment. The subacute
and long-term health impacts of this environmental and public health disaster remain unknown. For residents
of East Palestine and the surrounding communities, concern about the long term environmental and health
impacts of these exposures remains high. Due to the multi-pollutant nature of this chemical exposure, and the
potential for pre-existing exposures due to clustering of heavy industry within the area surrounding East
Palestine, a quantitative approach based on biospecimens is crucial to guide subsequent disease surveillance.
While chemical exposure assessment is typically done via interrogation of biospecimens in blood and urine for
specific contaminants, this approach only provides a snapshot of short-term chemical exposure. The somatic
mutation rate (SMR), however, provides a global overview of chemical exposures, as demonstrated by
previous research, and serves as a proxy for environmental chemical exposures. Here, we propose utilizing
SMR to establish a baseline for acute chemical exposure and long-term monitoring with respect to health and
disease risks. Our time-sensitive response, as proposed here, “Healthy Futures Research Study: Linking
somatic mutation rate with baseline exposure in East Palestine”, establishes the baseline impact of a subacute
chemical exposure utilizing a genomic biomarker as a surrogate measure for direct chemical concentration
levels given the mixture of potential contaminants. Our research proposal will i) develop and engage
participatory research in East Palestine and the greater region; ii) utilize a cross-sectional study to assess the
correlation between the SMR, a genomic biomarker, with geographical proximity to the train derailment
epicenter; and iii) elucidate perceived experiences post-disaster with qualitative approaches. This proposal will
establish and develop a shared partnership with community residents, formally organizing a Community
Advisory Board among community members, and providing a baseline biomarker for chemical exposure thus
serving as a baseline for longitudinal studies. Our responsive team is comprised of epidemiologists, community
outreach researchers, and healthcare advocates. Overall, this proposal establishes a cornerstone working with
the community, health departments, and other research institutions across the region to fully comprehend the
short- and long-term health impacts in the East Palestine community."

We propose to develop and optimize Susceptibility Weighted MRI (SWI) for the human SC in vivo at 7T and 3T
and apply/evaluate/validate in patients with MS to identify abnormal venous hallmarks of MS pathology. We
observed abnormally large anterior/posterior spinal veins, central vein sign (CVS), paramagnetic rims around
lesions and increased contrast from the venous plexus surrounding the SC are all present in the MS SC
compared to healthy volunteers. Yet, SC SWI has not been adequately optimized and validated at any field
strength. We address the knowledge gap of understudied SC SWI, and evaluating and validating in MS,
opening the door for application to pathologies that have previously been studied in the brain such as traumatic
injury, microbleeds, SC compression, and other vascular abnormalities. Our goal is to develop, optimize, and
apply/evaluate/validate SC SWI using both clinical (3T) and research (7T) field strengths in healthy controls
relapsing-remitting MS patients. SWI has implemented clinically in the brain for years. Recent work show that
7T and 3T SWI is useful for improving diagnostic specificity in MS, providing evidence for expanding/evolving
lesions, and insight into the biogenesis and evolution of the disease. While the same literature points to the
need to evaluate the SC with SWI, and post-mortem indicates similar pathological hallmarks in the SC in MS,
to date, exceedingly few studies have attempted SC SWI. And in those, brain-optimized SWI were moved into
the SC. There are no SC targeted developmental SWI studies and no studies at 7T. Of course, application of
developed techniques is critical to the validation process. One of the radiological “wins” for MS has been
identifying hallmark central vein sign (CVS) and/or paramagnetic rims indicating lesion evolution which has led
to controversial discussions about improved diagnostic specificity. Recently a consensus prepared by the
North American Imaging in MS consortium (NAIMS), of which the PI is a contributor, describes expectations for
brain SWI and argues for SC SWI to solidify SWI as improving diagnostic specificity. Yet there are no studies
providing this evidence. Operating under the premise that brain SWI has provided rich information about
diseases such as MS, TBI, etc, has improved our understanding of MS and MS lesion evolution, and armed
with our preliminary data at 7T that demonstrates MS patients have 1) abnormally large anterior spinal veins,
2) some lesions have apparent CVW and paramagnetic rim, and 3) abnormally apparent venous plexus
surrounding the SC, we propose that developing and optimizing a SC-specific SWI acquisition and post-
processing toolbox would offer unique ability to assess the venous structures of the SC and lead to further
opportunities in other diseases. 7T is considered the gold standard for SWI in MS in the brain, and we will
explore that, but recognize that 3T is more clinically relevant. Thus we will optimize across both 3T and 7T
using vendor stock sequences and advanced, sequences. The former to provide consideration for multi-
vendor, multi-site studies, and the latter, to vet and validate SWI as a biomarker for SC vascular abnormalities."

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is characterized by mild impairment in one or more cognitive functions and is
associated with an increased risk for failure to take prescribed medications. Hypertension is prevalent among
persons with MCI (PwMCI) and nonadherence to medications increases the risk of accelerated cognitive
decline through cerebrovascular disease. Adherence is often only 46% or lower among PwMCI. Further, the
COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the isolation of these individuals from care partners (friends, family, and
healthcare workers) who assist with medication management, uncovering the urgent need for developing self-
management tools. We have previously developed a theory-based mobile health (mHealth) system called
Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding, and Monitoring (MEDSReM) to support adherence in
cognitively normal older adults, which can be adapted for PwMCI. No existing studies have evaluated the
benefits of mHealth self-management tools to support hypertension medication adherence for PwMCI. In order
for such digital interventions to be beneficial, they have to be carefully designed/adapted to meet the unique
capabilities and limitations of PwMCI. User-centered technology has been shown to promote independence
and autonomy by compensating for lost cognitive skills. In this proposal, we are poised to address the unique
needs for digital technology use in this at-risk population of PwMCI based on user-centered design to guide the
development of Medication Education, Decision Support, Reminding, and Monitoring-Memory (MEDSReM-M)
system, conduct iterative usability testing to optimize the system for PwMCI, and examine the efficacy to
support hypertension medication adherence. In Aim 1, facilitators and barriers for use of MEDSReM will be
identified by interviewing PwMCI and their care partners, after they are shown the self-management system to
guide the development of MEDSReM-M. Then using heuristic evaluations and cognitive walkthroughs, and
through iterative usability testing with PwMCI, we will test, redesign, and optimize the system for PwMCI. In
Aim 2 we will conduct a randomized controlled trial involving 100 PwMCI to test the effects of MEDSReM-M
relative to an standardized educational control group on outcomes including adherence to hypertension
medications, blood pressure, self-determination (competence and autonomy), and technology acceptance. We
will then test predictors of the rate of change in medication adherence over 3 months to inform future large-
scale deployment. Taking a human factors approach to identify needs and requirements for technological
support to take medications as intended, and iterative testing for the usability of MEDSReM-M among PwMCI
with a consequent RCT, will result in a digital health intervention system that has the potential to reduce
cognitive decline associated with cardiovascular risks, save healthcare dollars, and promote autonomy and
quality of life in this vulnerable population."

Pediatric overweight and obesity continue to be major public health issues. Loss of control (LOC) eating is an
obesity-related phenotype that affects approximately 30% of children and adolescents with overweight/obesity
and may impede successful weight control. Pediatric overweight/obesity and LOC eating frequently emerge
during childhood and adolescence, and tend to follow a chronic and unremitting course if untreated. Both
conditions are associated with relative deficiencies in executive functioning (EF), including working memory,
planning, inhibitory control, and decision-making. These decrements may impair one’s ability to appropriately
regulate weight and eating behavior. A limitation of prior research is that it has been primarily cross-sectional in
nature, which inhibits understanding of the timing and direction of influence involved in the associations among
EF, weight change, and eating pathology. Moreover, little is known about the domain specificity of relative EF
deficits in youth with overweight/obesity and LOC eating, nor about their underlying neural substrates. An
improved understanding of the nature and prospective outcomes of EF impairments in youth with
overweight/obesity and LOC eating could inform intervention development by indicating whether treatments
should focus on improving general and/or food-specific EF, as well as which neural pathways should be
targeted to achieve the most robust and sustained effects on eating and weight. The proposed R01 study will
examine prospective associations between EF performance and related neural substrates, and child weight
change and LOC eating. Community-based children representing a spectrum of risk, including non-
overweight/obese (n=60), overweight/obese (n=60), and overweight/obese with comorbid LOC eating (n=60),
will provide repeated assessments of height/weight, LOC eating pathology, and general and food-specific EF
every 6-12 months over 2 years of follow-up. A subset of participants from each risk category will complete a
baseline and 18-month fMRI protocol assessing neural substrates of general and food-specific working
memory. Specific aims are to investigate prospective associations between both general and food-specific EF,
and their neural substrates, and trajectories of weight change and LOC eating (including remittance and
persistence) over 2 years. These data will clarify timing and trajectory of weight change and LOC eating in
relation to EF performance and its associated neural activation patterns. This study, which is the first to
prospectively examine associations among general and food-specific EF, weight trajectories, and LOC eating,
has clear potential to advance scientific and clinical understanding of mechanisms that promote the onset and
maintenance of maladaptive eating in youth and inform interventions to alleviate their cumulative personal and
societal burden. Furthermore, this application builds on the principal investigator’s programmatic line of
research on neurocognitive factors involved in eating- and weight-related problems, and provides a clear
pathway to future clinically and scientifically impactful studies."

Candidate: My overall career goal is to become an independent investigator and leader in an aging
related field focused on urologic diseases, especially lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD). Benign
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a disease that primarily affects aging men and manifests as urinary dysfunction.
However, the etiology of the disease is complex and multifactorial and the impact of aging on the hormone
environment is often not considered in current research. The overarching goal of my work is to examine the
effects of aging on sex steroid hormones that contribute to the development of disease and identify biomarkers
relevant to disease progression and treatment efficacy. The goal of this K01 career development proposal is to
provide me with the research experience and training needed to become an independent investigator and
leader in the field. My training will be targeted to three key areas: 1) molecular modeling of aging and disease,
2) identification and analysis of peripheral biomarkers, and 3) epigenetic modifiers of the aging steroid
hormone environment. This research experience combined with the mentoring from leading experts at the
University of Wisconsin – Madison will uniquely position me for a successful independent research career.
Research: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) impacts 50% of men in their 50s but dramatically increases to
90% of men in their 80s with annual treatment costs $4 billion. One consequence of aging in males is altered
steroid hormone synthesis and metabolism that leads to elevated levels of circulating estrogens. Estrogen
signaling through estrogen receptors (ER) within the prostate regulate prostate tissue homeostasis with ERα
associated with proliferation and ERβ with apoptosis. Current BPH treatments target the biosynthesis of
androgens with little consideration for androgen conversion to ER ligands. I hypothesize that selective ER
modulators (SERMs) can reestablish ERα:ERβ homeostasis through ERβ activation and reverse the
impact of ERα-mediated proliferation on BPH progression in the aging male. The critical elements of this
hypothesis will be tested in the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Determine the impact of age-related changes in steroidogenic enzymes required for ERβ ligand
production on prostate proliferation in vitro and in vivo.
Aim 2: Examine the effect of aging on the epigenetic regulation of steroid hormone metabolism and activity.
Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of SERMs to limit hyperplasia in the aging prostate.
The work proposed in these aims is designed to identify potential peripheral biomarkers to aid in assessing and
stratifying BPH patients with age-associated hormone driven hyperplasia. This will allow for the development of
novel combination pharmacotherapies that would enhance the clinical efficacy of current drug treatments."

Our project aims to recover solvents from waste streams with low concentrations of solvents, such
as chlorinated and aromatic solvents, DNAPL, MTBE, tetrahydro furan, and others. These waste
streams are typically produced by Superfund sites, and our primary objective is to recover the
solvents from them. These wastes are currently treated as hazardous waste for disposal, which
is an expensive and wasteful approach. Our proposal offers a sustainable solution by
concentrating dilute (1 to 10%) solvent waste to 60 or 70%, which can be sent to a distillation
column or purified through membrane separations such as pervaporation and nanofiltration to
generate pure solvents (95-99%). These recycled solvents can be resold in the market or
repurposed for other applications. To achieve our goals, we propose the development of
Microwave Induced Membrane Distillation (MIMD) with Carbon Nanotube Immobilized Membrane
(CNIM) or MIMD-CNIM. Here, a hydrophobic porous membrane with immobilized carbon
nanotubes separates a hot feed waste stream and a cold permeate. The membrane prevents the
aqueous solution from entering the pores, while the solvent vapor passes through and is
condensed on the permeate side of the membrane. The major advantage of CNIM is its ability to
selectively transport solvents by increasing the partitioning on the nanotube surface. The waste
stream is heated using a microwave heater, which enhances recovery via non-thermal effects
such as localized superheating, breakdown of hydrogen-bonded structures in aqueous
environments, and the creation of nanobubbles. We propose three specific aims, which include
1) membrane development; 2) testing of MIMD for different solvent streams and 3) testing with
real-world wastes. By developing this technology, we hope to provide a sustainable solution for
recovering solvents from aqueous solvent wastes, which can reduce the amount of hazardous
waste generated by Superfund sites and other industries. Moreover, this approach can contribute
to the circular economy by promoting the recycling and reuse of solvents."

Chromatin architecture plays important regulatory roles in gene expression and is critical to maintain cellular
identity. However, there are many unanswered questions regarding the interplay between chromatin
architecture and transcriptional gene regulation, specifically regarding how one influences the other and what
factors are involved in orchestrating long-range regulatory chromatin contacts. My proposal attempts to
address these questions by focusing on an understudied architectural factor called Ldb1.
 Ldb1 has been studied at select loci and can facilitate long-range chromatin interactions between
regulatory elements and target genes. The direct role of Ldb1 in facilitating chromatin architecture genome-
wide to drive lineage-specific gene expression profiles during hematopoiesis has not been clearly defined. We
will characterize Ldb1’s role in these processes using a well-studied cellular model system for erythroid
differentiation. We will measure genome-wide features of chromatin architecture and Ldb1 genomic occupancy
during the dynamic process of erythroid maturation. Additionally, we will acutely deplete Ldb1 to test how and
to what extent it is required to maintain chromatin architectural features and gene expression profiles before
and after terminal erythroid differentiation.
 Additionally, we will exploit the natural and highly dynamic processes that occur during cell cycle
progression to test Ldb1’s role in establishing chromatin architectural features genome-wide. Mitosis is marked
by the eviction of transcription factors, dissolution of most chromatin structure and a global cessation of
transcription. During exit from mitosis, daughter cells must re-establish 3D chromatin architecture and
transcriptomes that reflect the cell identity of the mother cell. Many features of chromatin architecture arise
during mitotic exit through unknown mechanisms and are independent of well-studied architectural factors
such as CTCF and Cohesin. We will profile Ldb1 genomic occupancy at closely spaced timepoints during the
mitosis-G1 phase transition to determine if its binding dynamics are correlated with the formation of chromatin
structures. Furthermore, we will test the requirement of Ldb1 to establish features of chromatin architecture by
selectively depleting it in mitosis and measuring cell cycle progression and chromatin architecture reformation
genome-wide.
 By using two natural cell state transitions (erythroid differentiation and cell cycle progression) in addition
to acute degradation, we will glean new insights into the underlying mechanisms of chromatin architecture and
how they drive lineage-specific gene expression."

Research suggests that if we can identify individuals at-risk for these disorders early, we may be able to
improve the course of illness and hopefully prevent illness onset all together. A first generation of studies
suggest that the approach of identifying those at clinical high-risk (CHR), through the use of specialized
interviews with help-seeking individuals (with attenuated psychosis symptoms) is a promising strategy for
exploring mechanisms associated with illness progression, understanding etiology, and identifying new
treatment targets. This work has two major limitations: 1) interview methods have limited specificity as only
15-20% of CHR individuals convert to psychosis, and 2) the expertise needed to make CHR diagnosis is
only accessible in a handful of metropolitan centers, and requires extensively trained staff. Here, we aim to
lay the foundation for a new approach to CHR assessment that will increase accessibility, and positive
predictive value. We propose to develop a new psychosis symptom domain sensitive (PSDS) battery,
prioritizing tasks that show correlations with the symptoms that define psychosis (actively tapping into
psychotic disorder-specific processes, rather than to trait vulnerability signs) and relatedly, that are tied to
the neurobiological systems and computational mechanisms implicated in these symptoms. To promote
accessibility, we utilize inexpensive behavioral tasks that could be administered over the internet; this will set
the stage for later research testing widespread screening in help-seeking as well as non-help seeking
populations, that would identify those most in need of in-depth assessment. Before this can be
accomplished however, it is necessary to determine which tasks are effective for predicting illness course
and how this strategy compares to the first-generation prediction methods. We propose to recruit 500 CHR
participants, 500 help-seeking individuals, and 500 healthy controls across 5 sites and in Aim 1, develop a
PSDS battery risk calculator based on measures that prove to be most sensitive to imminent conversion.
Further, the inclusion of a help-seeking comparison group is critical for translating the PSDS calculator into
clinical practice, where the goal is to differentiate those at greatest risk for developing a psychotic disorder
from others forms of psychopathology. In Aim 2, we will compare the sensitivity and specificity of the PSDS
risk-calculator to the North American Prodromal Study
(NAPLS) risk-calculator (a gold-standard first-generation tool) in the prediction of psychosis conversion over
a 2 year- period. Last, in Aim 3, the study will determine if the PSDS predicts functional outcomes over the
course of 2 years. Predicting diagnosis is important but being able to provide early intervention to limit the
disability characteristic of psychosis is a priority. This project will answer the preliminary questions
necessary for a next-generation CHR battery, tied to illness mechanisms and powered by cutting-edge
computational methods, that can be used to facilitate the earliest possible detection of psychosis risk."

Understanding and eliminating TB depends on understanding the host and pathogen dynamics in granulomas,
where the outcomes of M. tuberculosis infection are determined. Despite substantial efforts, the cellular
composition, spatial interactions, and mechanisms that determine outcomes such as pathologic
granuloma necrosis are poorly understood. One explanation for the limited understanding of granulomas is that
most studies are performed in a single experimental system in isolation. We have formed a consortium to
perform and integrate studies of TB granulomas in three systems: humans, rhesus macaques, and new
strains of mice. In these three systems, we will address several major questions in TB granuloma biology:
what is the extent of diversity in cell composition in TB granulomas? What regulates cell trafficking and
spatial interactions in TB granulomas? What are the roles of type I interferons (TIIFN) and interferon
gamma (IFNg) in regulating and determining cell trafficking, differentiation, spatial relationships, and activation
states in TB granulomas? What are the pathogen and host determinants of necrosis, a pathologic outcome,
in TB granulomas? Our primary mode for investigating these and other questions will be high-parameter
multiplex immunostaining of TB granulomas from the three species, as this will provide essential insight into
the spatial relationships between immune cell subsets. Multiplex immunostaining will be complemented by
studies of live imaging of cell dynamics in rhesus macaque granulomas and by strategically-timed transfers
of labeled cells in rhesus macaques and diverse strains of mice. The value of the multiplex immunostaining
studies will be further enhanced by deep characterization of dissociated cell populations at the single-cell
level, using high parameter flow cytometry and single-cell transcriptomics. A uniquely important contribution
of our proposed project is the computational integration of data from humans, rhesus macaques, and new
strains of mice. By integrating multispecies data, we will identify the features of TB granulomas that are
common to all three species, and we will identify factors that are unique to granulomas in each species, to
guide further modifications to improve the utility of studies in animal models. Integration of the data from the
three species will allow studies in rhesus macaques to be compared with those of human samples and
new strains of mice; this will improve the understanding and interpretation of human pathology studies, and
enhance the value of studies that can take advantage of using the unique advantages of mice for mechanistic
studies. Together, our studies will advance the knowledge and understanding of TB biology, and guide
development of interventions to improve treatment outcomes, limit lung damage, and improve lung tissue
repair in people suffering from TB."

Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A major issue in the setting of heart
failure is loss of cardiomyocytes, and the inability of adult mammalian cardiomyocytes to replace themselves
by cell cycle re-entry and cell division. In contrast, newts, zebrafish and neonatal mammalian cardiomyocytes
can undergo mitotic cell division to regenerate the heart. Previous studies aimed at provoking cell cycle re-
entry and proliferation of adult mammalian cardiomyocytes have met with partial success. Recalcitrance of
adult cardiomyocytes to efficiently undergo proliferative cell division reflects epigenetic and transcriptional
programs that dictate multiple properties of the adult cardiomyocyte state that provide barriers to their
proliferative ability. These barriers include: activation of cell cycle inhibitors; repression of cell cycle activators;
a metabolic state geared toward availability of relatively high oxygen levels with high numbers of mitochondria,
abundant and highly organized myofibrillar structure, and high levels of binucleation. Thus, alteration of a
signaling pathway or overexpression of a single cell cycle regulator may not be able to efficiently overcome all
these obstacles. Instead, promoting efficient proliferation of adult cardiomyocytes is likely to require a multi-
pronged approach, where each of these obstacles is overcome. Although we know much about epigenetic and
transcriptional programs regulating cardiomyocyte development, our knowledge concerning epigenetic and
transcriptional programs regulating the complex transitions from the fetal to adult cardiomyocyte state
is limited. A comprehensive in depth understanding of these programs will give insight into mechanisms by
which we can overcome multiple barriers within adult cardiomyocytes to promote cell cycle re-entry. In the
proposed studies, we will examine cardiomyocyte cell cycle regulation by a key epigenetic regulator, Dot1L,
identify transcription factor codes driving distinct states of cardiomyocyte cell cycle, examine effects of key
metabolic transcription factors, HIFs, on adult cardiomyocyte proliferation, and investigate the potential role of
atypical E2F factors on cardiomyocyte binucleation and proliferation. Results of these studies will be
groundbreaking and be of future impact in that we hope to provide a roadmap of specific nodal points that
can be targeted to allow the adult cardiomyocyte to undergo productive and regulated proliferation, thus paving
the way for regenerative therapies for the heart.

10794299,"Failure of traditional therapy in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is due to our limited
understanding of how the tumor microenvironment (TME) can facilitate the rapid progression or recurrence
of PDAC. In PDAC, the stromal cells identified as cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) account for up to
90% of tumor volume. Recent studies have revealed the significance of branched chain amino acids
(BCAAs) in cancer. However, the role of stromal cells in support of BCAA metabolism in tumors is still poorly
understood. Understanding cancer-stromal ecosystem requires insight into the intersection of cancer-
associated transformations in the stroma with reprogramming of their BCAA metabolism. SMAD4 deletion is a
frequent event in PDAC. However, the metabolic role of SMAD4-deleted PDAC cells in modulating activation of
stromal cell transformation is unknown. Our proposed aims here have aimed to bridge this knowledge gap.
We propose a differential BCAA metabolism in cancer and stromal compartments of PDAC tumors and
uncover a heavy reliance of PDAC cells on CAF-secreted branched chain keto acids (BCKAs) in stromal-
rich tumors. We hypothesize that reactive stromal BCAA metabolism is altered from quiescent stroma and is
the driver for regulating PDAC cell growth by secreting BCKAs. Second, SMAD4-deleted PDAC cells induces
metabolic alterations in stromal cells. First, we will validate stromal BCKA synthesis metabolic pathway as a
lethal target in patient-derived circulating tumor cell (CTC)-organoids and patient-derived tissue slices, using
13C-based isotope tracing and genetic tools and unravel that CAF-secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) is a
source for BCKA. To understand the mechanism behind ECM degradation, we will regulate proteasomal
proteolysis of ECM in CTC-organoids and patient-derived tissue slices. Second, to elucidate SMAD4-deletion
in PDAC cells induced metabolic rewiring of CAFs we have proposed loss-of-function studies and use CTC-
organoids and tissue slices to demonstrate increased stromal-reliance of SMAD4-deleted PDAC cells on
stromal BCAT1 and elucidate temporal metabolic reprogramming in SMAD4-deleted CTC-organoids over time
course of organoid formation. Third, we will test the efficacy of targeting BCKA anabolism in CAFs with
conditional knockout mice and perform in vivo studies targeting stromal BCKA anabolic pathway using patient-
derived low-passage cell lines and the syngeneic allograft model. Importantly, we will inhibit stromal BCAT1 in
the proposed Aims using Gabapentin, Erg 240 (BCAT1 inhibitor from Ergon Pharma), ERG 245 (BCAT1/2
inhibitor from Ergon Pharma), & CRISPR targeting of BCAT1 in CAFs. Notably, our proposed aims will reveal a
novel BCAA metabolism-centric regulatory role of reactive stroma in cancers and will uncover the underlying
mode of action of this regulation. These findings can lead to novel therapeutics targeting communication
between cancer cells and their microenvironment."

Gene editing therapy using the Nobel Prize award-winning CRISPR-Cas9 technology promises a
permanent cure for thousands of human diseases. Up to date, CRISPR tools have enabled
dozens of FDA-approved clinical trials to tackle single-gene disorders (e.g., sickle cell disease),
infectious (e.g., HIV) and complex diseases (e.g., cancer). Yet to realize CRISPR’s full therapeutic
potential, many issues remain to be addressed.
Most of the current gene editing work uses Cas9, the RNA-guided nuclease of Type II CRISPR.
Cas9 nuclease tools suffer from several drawbacks, including low efficacy in precise gene
modification mediated by human cells’ intrinsic homology-directed repair pathway, and serious
safety concerns caused by the toxic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) formed at on- and off-
target sites. The non-DSB-reliant base editors (BEs) offer a path towards safer, highly-efficiency,
and precise single nucleotide editing using DNA deaminase fused to catalytically impaired Cas9.
But their targeting scope is limited by two factors, the NGG PAM required by Cas9 to be present
next to the target site, and the inflexible editing window position. Here we propose to leverage
another major branch of native CRISPR, the Type I (T1) systems, to broaden the targeting scope
for gene editing therapy.
In 2019, we pioneered T1 CRISPR-mediated genome engineering in human cells. Our ensuing
study expanded the T1 toolbox by harnessing the most compact groups of Type I editors with
diverse PAM preferences and guide orthogonality. We also found that a hidden gene product of
the T1 machinery, Cas11, must be expressed from its own eukaryotic translation initiation element
to enable robust editing by compact T1 gene editors. Built on these lines of prior work, we propose
to establish novel T1 CRISPR tools and apply them to correct disease-causing mutations.
Successful completion of Phase I work will set a solid foundation for Phase II, where we plan to
evaluate the efficacy and safety of T1 CRISPR gene therapy strategies in preclinical cell and
animal models."

10804613,"The term ""Overlap Syndrome"" (OS) is used to describe the presence of both chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in a single patient. Due to premature aging, patients with OS
are prone to developing functional decline up to 20 years earlier than the general population. The International
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) evaluates functional status in chronic pulmonary disease
globally in 5 domains. We propose to study validated outcomes in 3 of these domains: 1) participation in life
situations, measured by the 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36); 2) physical activity (PA), measured by daily step
counts; and 3) cardiovascular health, measured by cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), flow-mediated endothelial
dilation (FMD) and serum hs-CRP, lipids and glucose. Our long-term goal is to develop an exercise strategy
tailored to Veterans with OS which will reduce their risk of functional decline through increased PA.
 Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a common symptom of OSA that persists in a third of patients
despite optimal treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). EDS is associated with decreased
quality of life and daily activity and increased risk of CVD and further, improves with exercise. Understanding the
relationship of EDS with these domains of functional status within the context of an exercise intervention provides
an opportunity to tailor exercise strategies to this complex patient population. We propose to investigate Veterans
with EDS-OS because they are at highest risk for functional decline yet have the greatest barriers to exercise.
 Exercise trials performed in patients with COPD or OSA show that moderate intensity continuous training
(MICT) decreased EDS and increased SF-36, PA, CRF and hs-CRP. MICT remains underutilized despite its
well-established benefits. Thus, we propose to test moderate intensity interval training (MIIT), a novel 5-minute
interval-based exercise intervention that meets the individual needs and capacities of Veterans with OS. In
addition, we will study behavioral barriers to exercise using the self-efficacy for exercise (SEE) Scale and
Brainwriting Premortem, an efficient stakeholder feedback technique, to facilitate the design of a future home-
based MIIT intervention and its successful translation into bouts of daily PA (future Merit Application).
 We propose a randomized trial of MIIT (5-minute intervals at 50% VO2peak 3 times weekly for 12 weeks)
in Veterans with OS vs. standard of care controls. The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) will be assessed at
baseline. Veterans with the EDS-OS phenotype (ESS >10) will enter the MIIT trial. The specific aims are:
1) To determine the effect of MIIT on participation in life situations compared to usual care control
Hypothesis 1: MIIT improves: a) SF-36 physical and mental scores; and b) Epworth Sleepiness Scale.
Hypothesis 2. The EDS-OS phenotype will be associated with poor SF-36 scores and will exhibit improvement
with MIIT that is mediated by improved Epworth Sleepiness Scale.
2) To determine the effect of MIIT on physical activity compared to usual care control
Hypothesis 3: MIIT increases daily step count as measured by accelerometry.
Hypothesis 4. The EDS-OS phenotype will be associated with greater limitations in baseline step count and will
exhibit improvement with MIIT that is mediated by improved Epworth Sleepiness Scale.
3) To determine the effect of MIIT on cardiovascular health compared to usual care control
Hypothesis 5: MIIT a) increases CRF (VO2peak) and FMD; and b) decreases serum hs-CRP, lipids and glucose
Hypothesis 6: The EDS-OS phenotype will be associated with greater limitations in baseline cardiovascular
health and will exhibit improvement with MIIT that is mediated by improved Epworth Sleepiness Scale.
4) To explore behavioral barriers to translation of MIIT into sustainable healthy lifestyle change
Hypothesis 7: Low self-efficacy for exercise is associated with poor compliance to MIIT.
Hypothesis 8: Brainwriting Premortem will identify pre-implementation barriers to a future home-based MIIT."
10804615,"Rationale: By 2018, 31 states had an obesity rate ≥30% and none <20%. Costs due to obesity are estimated
at $190B/yr. 72% of Veterans are overweight (45%) or obese (27%), of which 66% have hypertension and
31% have diabetes. Researchers use vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) to treat a number of conditions, including
obesity. Sensory afferents in the vagus nerves innervate the stomach and relay information about the state of
the stomach, particularly the degree of stomach wall stretch associated with increased stomach volume.
However, VNS parameters vary widely and it is unknown how changes in stimulus parameters alter outcomes.
Until the parameter-to-outcome relationship is mapped, developing optimal stimulus waveforms is impossible.
Objective: The objectives of this study are to map the relationship between stimulus parameters and 1) nerve
recruitment, 2) brain activity in regions associated with satiety, and 3) food consumption. Further, a novel
stimulus waveform and interface for delivering more effective bilateral VNS will be evaluated. Numerous
hypotheses will be tested through a series of animal experiments over a period of 4 years.
Research Plan and Methodology: During Aim 1, the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve will be implanted with a
nerve cuff electrode in rats. The rats will remain healthy or become obese depending on their diet. Once per
month, the animal will receive subdiaphragmatic VNS (sVNS) while an fMRI image of brain activity is acquired.
The effects of VNS intensity, VNS waveform, diet type, and time on activation of the brain in key regions
responsible for satiety and reward will be determined. During Aim 2, the subdiaphragmatic vagus nerve will be
implanted with a nerve cuff electrode in rats. The rats will have simultaneous access to three diet types. Each
week VNS will be provided for multiple days. The amount and type of food consumed as well as the overall
activity of the rat during days of stimulation will be compared to days without stimulation. The effects of VNS
intensity and waveform on food consumption and activity will be determined. During Aim 3, a novel cuff that
wraps around the esophagus and delivers bilateral VNS will be implanted. As with Aim 2, the rats will have
simultaneous access to three diet types and both food consumption and activity during days of stimulation will
be compared to days without stimulation. The effects of VNS intensity on food consumption and activity will be
determined and compared to those found in Aim 2. Esophageal resistance to distension and histology will be
used to assess if the implant remains safe after 6 months. Additionally, the map between VNS stimulus
intensity and axon recruitment within the vagus nerve will be mapped.
Expected Outcomes: This study provides the necessary data to facilitate understanding how sVNS effects the
system at three levels by generating a map that links sVNS parameters to: 1) axon recruitment within
the vagus nerves; 2) brain activation; and 3) short-term food consumption. These maps, which are currently
unknown, are critical for sVNS parameter optimization, which, itself, is critical for successful clinical
deployment. Importantly, we will know at what rate activation in the brain changes as a function of diet type.
This rate of change will be critical to understand if and when MRI can be used for optimization. We will know
how activation changes with sVNS waveform, which is critical when determining if parameter optimization is
independent of waveform. We will know if a novel helical cuff can safely and effectively provide long-term
bilateral sVNS, which is critical for expanding the searchable parameter space in small pre-clinical animals,
which are, themselves, ideal for optimization studies. This study will produce 4 manuscripts.
Benefit to Veterans: With regard to obesity, 72% of Veterans are overweight or obese. Obesity has several
comorbidities including hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes. There is a strong link between obesity and
depression. Although this study is entirely preclinical, it is a critical first step in developing optimal stimulus
waveforms. If the study is successful, then there is a planned pathway to translation."

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) accounts for over 80% of esophageal cancer cases and has a
poor prognosis, largely due to the absence of symptoms in the early stages. Although an early diagnosis of
ESCC may lead to better outcomes in treatment, early detection is challenging since ESCC originates from the
basal cell layer and invades the lamina propria. Therefore, understanding the biology of ESCC initiation and
developing model systems that recapitulate ESCC neoplasia is crucial. Currently, the mechanism of ESCC
initiation and immune landscape remodeling during ESCC initiation and tumorigenesis remain unclear. We have
established a genetically engineered murine esophageal organoid model system that has shown significant
potential to study ESCC initiation. Through CRISPR-based genetic manipulation of murine esophageal
organoids, we identified the key tumor suppressor genes most frequently deleted in ESCC patients and
established 32 esophageal organoid lines. Transcriptomics of the neoplastic organoids indicated a transcriptional
signature consistent with ESCC patients, and single-cell transcriptomics identified distinct cell lineage, multiple
root cells, and critical regulons of such neoplastic organoids. Interestingly, only specific neoplastic organoid-
derived cells developed tumors in immunocompetent mice. Our preliminary results suggest that the loss of tumor
suppressor genes is a crucial event for ESCC initiation by inducing esophageal neoplasia (cell-autonomous) and
remodeling the immune landscape (non-cell-autonomous). Therefore, we hypothesize that the combinatorial loss
of tumor suppressor genes initiates ESCC by inducing esophageal neoplasia, cell plasticity, and immune
evasion. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims: Aim 1. To determine the genetic and
transcriptional network initiating ESCC using new model systems; Aim 2. To determine the impact of targeting
the ESCC-driven immune landscape remodeling on ESCC initiation and tumorigenesis. The study will fill the
current knowledge gap by unveiling the biology of ESCC initiation and providing new models for developing
viable therapeutic applications for early ESCC."
10799837,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are one of the two known main classes of interstitial cells that regulate
gastrointestinal (GI) motor functions in health and disease. Throughout the GI tract, ICC modulate smooth
muscle excitability, facilitate efferent and afferent neural control, and generate electrical slow waves (SWs),
which drive phasic contractile activity underlying peristalsis and segmentation. Pacemaker activity is
compartmentalized in specific ICC classes in an organ-specific manner. Current models of SW generation
involve spontaneous transient inward currents triggered by Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum,
activation of other ion channels including voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents, Ca2+-activated Ca2+ release, and
store-operated Ca2+ entry. Previous work supported by this grant demonstrated selective expression of the
regulated isoform of the electrogenic Na+/HCO3− cotransporter SLC4A4 (solute carrier family 4 member 4;
isoform NBCe1b) in pacemaker ICC classes and revealed a role for intracellular HCO3−/pH regulation in SW
activity, adding a new component to the ICC pacemaker apparatus. However, while SLC4A4’s roles in acid-
base regulation and renal tubular acidosis are well established, its significance to GI disease in humans
remains unclear as is its precise role in SW generation and the mechanisms of regulation of its expression and
function. Linking SLC4A4 to GI diseases is a major challenge because of the uncertainty about the phenotypes
associated with its dysfunction or dysregulation. Furthermore, mechanistic evaluation of gene function and
regulation in ICC is severely limited by the phenotypic instability of these cells in culture. Based on strong
preliminary data, in this proposal we aim to overcome these difficulties by screening a large phenome-wide
association study (PheWAS, which starts with SNVs and searches for associated traits) for SNVs associated
with GI disease-related phenotypes that map within the topologically associating domain containing SLC4A4
(i.e., where most cis-regulatory interactions occur) (Specific Aim1). We will predict the significance of these
SNVs by deep epigenomic profiling and validate the predicted functions by genome and epigenome editing
(Specific Aim 2). To enable these experimental manipulations and the detailed analysis of the regulation of
SLC4A4 functions in the context of SW activity, we have validated cell lines derived from gastrointestinal
stromal tumors (GISTs) as models of human pacemaker ICC. In Specific Aim 3, we will subject GIST cells
expressing or lacking SLC4A4 to genetic and pharmacological manipulations along with phosphoproteomics to
dissect the contribution of SLC4A4 to SW activity in the context of cholinergic and KIT receptor tyrosine kinase
signaling. SLC4A4’s role in GI motor functions will be investigated using Slc4a4-deleted mice. Results from this
project will establish genotype-phenotype relationships for SLC4A4 and the mechanisms of epigenetic control
of SLC4A4 expression in the context of GI disorders. We will also determine the contribution of SLC4A4
activity to SWs and the pathways regulating SLC4A4 function, setting the stage for future preclinical work."
10799838,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Genetic studies identify glutamatergic synaptic alterations as a core etiological mechanism of schizophrenia
(SZ). Consistent with genetic findings, in vivo and postmortem brain studies identify alterations to molecular,
structural and physiological markers consistent with deficient cortical glutamate synaptic neurotransmission.
However, the nature of synaptic impairments in SZ at individual cortical glutamate synapses, the most basic unit
of neural communication, is unknown. Interrogating measures of pre- and postsynaptic functioning at individually-
resolved synapses can provide unprecedented insight into the basis of synaptic dysfunction in SZ. Analysis at
this level of resolution requires an electron microscopic approach to directly visualize synaptic structures and
quantify ultrastructural correlates of pre- and postsynaptic functions. Despite the potent interpretative power
provided by ultrastructural analyses of individual synapses, multiple technical and logistical barriers have
prevented the large-scale application to study brain tissue in SZ. We have now developed a workflow permitting
three-dimensional (3D) quantitative and nanometer resolution imaging of glutamate synaptic structures via
focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) in postmortem human brain. Thus, in Aim 1, we
determine the effect of SZ on ultrastructural correlates of core pre- and postsynaptic processes in individual
glutamate synapses located in layer 3 (L3) of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a locus of in vivo functional,
structural and molecular abnormalities in SZ. Because synaptic signaling requires substantial energy produced
by mitochondria localized to synaptic structures, and reduced glutamatergic signaling lowers ATP demand and
synthesis at the synapse, ultrastructural analysis of mitochondria localized to glutamate axon terminals informs
the relative level of activity at individual synapses. Indeed, mitochondrial abundance, size and morphology
change in direct response to altered energetic demand at synapses. Thus, in Aim 2, we use our FIB-SEM
approach to quantify ultrastructural correlates of mitochondrial activity in each glutamate synaptic structure
identified in Aim 1. Finally, synaptic structure and function are directly regulated by synaptic protein levels. As
such, the molecular basis of the synaptic and mitochondrial ultrastructural alterations identified in Aims 1-2 can
be informed by proteomic analyses of DLPFC L3 synaptosomes. We have optimized a high throughput workflow
to quantify thousands of proteins in synaptosome preparations from DLPFC L3. Thus, in Aim 3, alterations in the
DLPFC L3 synaptic proteome in SZ are identified, quantified and mapped to ultrastructural alterations identified
in Aims 1 and 2. Our proposed studies will directly inform the structural and molecular bases of cortical glutamate
synaptic dysfunction in SZ at an unparalleled level of resolution to inform future functional pathway and molecular
therapeutic targets for cortical and cognitive dysfunction in SZ."

 In this R21 exploratory/developmental grant application, we propose to develop and validate
methodologies for in vivo analysis of RNA targeting in specific circuits, as well as investigating the regulation of
these RNAs during long-term memory storage (LTM). The significance of RNAs localized to dendrites for local
translation is well known. However, current methodologies do not provide accurate identification of RNAs
targeted to distinct subcellular compartments. For example, several studies utilizing molecular analysis of
microdissected dendrites or neuronal processes have identified RNAs in the distally localized neurons of diverse
organisms, including sea slugs and mice. A major caveat of this approach is that the microdissected regions
contain dendrites/neuronal processes from several different neurons as well as segments of interneurons and
localized non-neuronal cells. Thus, this approach yields RNAs from dendrites of multiple neurons and non-
neuronal cells, preventing our ability to identify the neuron-specific, distally targeted RNAs necessary to generate
a more profound understanding of RNA localization and LTM. Since, learning and memory involves changes
that are circuit-specific, the lack of robust and reliable methodologies to identify circuit-specific, targeted RNAs
acts as a critical barrier to our understanding of RNA targeting in vivo, as well as the role that these RNAs play
in both in LTM and disorders of memory. To address this critical knowledge gap, we here propose a strategy
that starts with the expression of a tagged kinesin that mediates the transport of RNAs in specific neurons
followed by immunoprecipitation of kinesin complexes from distinct neuronal projections and identification and
rigorous characterization of associated RNAs. We anticipate that our kinesin-based strategy will yield deep
insights into in vivo RNA targeting and their modulation by LTM."

Chronic HBV infection is a critical public health problem affecting approximately 296 million individuals
worldwide. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of HBV persistence will facilitate the
development of new antivirals for the treatment of chronic HBV infection; however, these efforts are hampered
by deficiencies in current animal models susceptible to HBV infection. The Eastern woodchuck, naturally infected
with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) that is closely related to HBV, is a well-established animal model for
the study of HBV infection. The HBV PreCore gene, which encodes the secreted e antigen (eAg), is the least
characterized viral gene due to technical constraints. Studies in woodchucks have shown that the PreCore gene
is dispensable for WHV replication but necessary for facilitating chronic infection. We have recently discovered
a novel PreCore-encoded protein, named PreC, which is also secreted in HBV-infected patients and
chimpanzees and in WHV-infected woodchucks following alternative processing to eAg. Both the HBV and WHV
PreC and eAg show heterogeneous density distributions. These results suggest that the PreC protein may have
a function(s) distinct from eAg to facilitate chronic infection, and that both PreC and eAg functions may be related
to their density distributions. Thus, in Aim 1 we propose to explore the functions of PreCore-derived proteins in
modulating WHV infection. This will be achieved by liver transfection of woodchucks with a WHV construct
containing a single point mutation, which increases the efficiency of signal peptide cleavage and thus increases
the eAg level relative to PreC, and by comparing the course of infection by the mutant to wildtype WHV. In Aim
2, we propose to explore the dynamic changes of the WHV PreC/eAg density profile during infection and antiviral
treatment in woodchucks and the composition of the HBV and WHV low-density PreC/eAg populations. This will
be achieved by analyzing a large set of archival serum samples from woodchucks infected as neonates or adults
or treated with nucleos(t)ide analogs or interferon-alpha. Presence of the low-density PreC/eAg population may
cause or at least be associated with the chronic outcome of WHV infection, while reduction or loss may be
associated with, or predict, effective viral suppression or functional cure of chronic infection under certain antiviral
treatments. The composition of the low-density PreC/eAg proteins will be explored by analyzing their association
with one or more extracellular vesicles or with lipoproteins. Successful completion of the proposed research will
have a significant impact on identifying new viral and host factors involved in HBV persistence and may establish
the low-density PreC/eAg population as a potential biomarker for predicting progression to chronic HBV infection
and/or outcome of antiviral treatment."

The long-term goal of this project is to delineate at an unprecedented level of precision how all the
neurotransmitter and neuropeptide signaling events within a model neural circuit together produce its dynamic
pattern of activity. Neural circuits are a basic unit of brain function and altered signaling within neural circuits can
disrupt circuit function to produce human brain diseases. To date, our understanding of such diseases remains
vague because we understand only a few individual features within each of the many different neural circuits
that have been studied. Therefore, our approach is to analyze all the signaling events within one simple neural
circuit, anticipating that this will yield new insights into how neural circuits in general work. This approach is
inspired by past successes in other areas of biology in which deep analysis of a simple model in a genetically
tractable organism (e.g. the lac operon in E. coli) led to conceptual breakthroughs that generalized to human
biology. Thus, we are intensely studying the simple egg-laying behavior circuit of C. elegans, in which we have
developed a powerful combination of genetic, optogenetic, chemogenetic, and Ca2+ imaging approaches that
provide unprecedented mechanistic insights into circuit function. This circuit alternates between ~20 minute
inactive states when eggs collect in the uterus and ~2.5 minute active states when eggs are laid. In past work,
we studied how the circuit turns on, and we now turn our focus to understanding how the circuit turns off. We
identified specific neurotransmitters and neuropeptides that signal through the heterotrimeric G protein Gαo to
turn off the circuit by antagonizing the Gαq signaling that turns the circuit on. Aim 1 uses biochemistry, genetics,
Ca2+ and fluorescent reporter imaging, and electrophysiology to test our hypothesis that Gαo directly activates a
G protein GTPase activator to terminate Gαq/Rho signaling and a diacylglycerol kinase to terminate Gαq/PLCBb
signaling, thus inhibiting neuron and muscle electrical excitability. Aim 2 uses genetics, Ca2+ imaging, and
electron microscopy to define structures and functions of the remaining uncharacterized components of the
circuit, including 1) PVW neurons, which we found branch over the egg-laying muscles and regulate egg laying;
and 2) gap junctions between these muscle cells. Aim 3 studies how mechanosensory feedback inhibits the
circuit after eggs are successfully laid. We discovered that specific neurons detect egg release, and that egg-
laying muscles appear to detect when fewer unlaid eggs remain in the uterus. We will use genetics, Ca2+ imaging,
and physiological approaches to study the mechanisms of this mechanosensory feedback inhibition of circuit
activity. The molecular, cellular, and circuit-level mechanisms we are defining that control activity of the C.
elegans egg-laying circuit are likely conserved and will inform our understanding of neural circuits in general.
Aim 1. We will determine how Gαo antagonizes Gαq signaling to regulate neuron and muscle activity.
Aim 2. We will define the remaining components of the egg-laying circuit and their connectivity.
Aim 3. We will determine how mechanosensory feedback of egg laying turns the circuit off."

Autistic Children are at 160 times greater risk of drowning than the general pediatric population. Though swim
instruction is recommended as a drowning prevention strategy, there is extremely limited research evaluating
swim instruction for autistic children and no comparative trials. We developed Sensory Enhanced Aquatics
(SEA), a swimming and water-safety program specifically to accommodate autistic children’s unique
challenges and learning needs. Program evaluation data showed SEA improved children’s swim skills, with
74% improving at least one swim level (n=40) and 100% of parents feeling safer with their child around water.
Thus, we propose to conduct a single blind, randomized controlled pilot trial to test the differential effects of an
eight-week (16 lesson) SEA intervention and standard swim lessons on attainment of swimming and water-
safety skills of autistic children. We will enroll 50 autistic children aged 5-9 years who will be randomized 1:1 by
minimization to either the SEA intervention or standard swim lessons to minimize imbalanced group allocation
by autism severity and baseline swim skill. Aim 1 will compare the effects of SEA to standard swimming
lessons on swimming and water safety skills of autistic children with a swim test based on Red Cross water-
competency guidelines. Aim 2 will assess which participant characteristics (e.g., age, motor ability, autism
severity) are associated with the highest post-intervention swim skills and water safety across both groups to
inform who benefits most from swim instruction. Child sex and co-occurring motor impairment will be
considered as potential covariates. Data will be collected before swim lessons and after 8 weeks of SEA or
standard lessons. We hypothesize children in both groups will demonstrate improvement in swimming and
water safety skills with greater improvements in the SEA group; autism severity and motor ability will have the
greatest associations with swim skill in both groups. Our exploratory aim will employ post-intervention semi-
structured interviews to explore child, parent, and instructor perspectives about instructional methods most
effective for developing swimming and water-safety among autistic children. The information obtained from this
study will improve our understanding of the best strategies for swim instruction for autistic children and support
our long-term goal to make SEA scalable on the national level to prevent drowning of autistic children."
10809993,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Research has shown that the security of a child's attachment to their primary caregiver is crucial to their social
relationships and overall well-being. Attachment security is developed through contingent and responsive
interactions between the child and caregiver, with physical proximity playing a vital role in building trust.
Despite the importance of real-world caregiver–child interactions, previous research has largely focused on
laboratory-assessed caregiver quality. To address this gap, we have developed a wearable device called
TotTag, which can dynamically and unobtrusively measure real-time physical proximity between device
wearers. TotTags are worn in vests by children and in waistbands by caregivers to assess patterns of close
contact in children's everyday lives. In this NIH exploratory/developmental research grant, we plan to recruit
100 families with a 12-month-old child from diverse racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds. During a
home visit, we will assess caregiver sensitivity with up to two caregivers per child. Each caregiver and the
infant will then wear TotTags from the child's wake time to bedtime (~12 hours) to assess time in close
proximity and the number of caregiver–child ""check-ins"" (i.e., periods of close contact between periods of
separation). Finally, we will conduct the Strange Situation Procedure to assess attachment security with each
available caregiver. Aim 1 will explore aspects of caregiver–child proximity in relation to attachment security.
Aim 2 will examine the potential additive and interactive contributions of caregiver sensitivity and caregiver–
child proximity in relation to attachment security. By obtaining sensitivity and proximity data at the dyad level
(e.g., child with mother; child with father) within a family, we aim to gain insight into the specific aspects of each
caregiver–child relationship associated with attachment security. Furthermore, this rich intensive longitudinal
data of proximity patterns will be made available to allow for exploration of other relevant questions of interest
(e.g., associations with family structure; weekend vs. weekday patterns). In addition, we will obtain information
regarding the fidelity and acceptability of ecological assessments in families with infants in anticipation of a
larger program of research examining the longitudinal development of attachment starting in early infancy. This
cross-sectional study, using innovative new technology coupled with home-based caregiver sensitivity
assessments and gold-standard laboratory assessments of attachment, will provide an unprecedented picture
of infants' daily experiences with their caregivers. Findings from this study will aid in setting the foundation for
future work focused on fostering healthy development through secure attachment relationships."
10813035,"Project Summary Biofilm, a protective extracellular-polymeric substance that surrounds bacterial colonies, is
associated with more than 80% of microbial infections. In the United States, the management cost for biofilm-
associated infections reaches 94 billion US dollars and is responsible for 0.5 million deaths annually. In particular,
millions of wound patients suffer from biofilm-associated infections that lead to persistent inflammation and
edema, and ultimately hinder wound healing. Biofilm bacteria are 1,000 times more resistant to antibiotics than
free-floating bacteria. In a clinical setting, it is common to remove biofilm from the wound with debridement or
enzymes. However, these methods do not remove biofilm in space deep in the wounded tissue, thus allowing
biofilm recurrence. To this end, we recently invented a self-locomotive, antimicrobial micro-robot (SLAM) that
can invade and remove biofilm. The SLAM is prepared by activating diatom biosilica doped with MnO2
nanocatalysts (MnO2-diatom) to generate oxygen microbubbles using a 3 % hydrogen peroxide solution. The
activated MnO2-diatoms propel themselves to enter the biofilm. Within the biofilm, the activated MnO2-diatoms
continue to generate microbubbles that fuse and produce mechanical energy high enough to fracture biofilm. It
takes 10 minutes for the activated MnO2-diatoms to remove more than 99.9 % of 0.8 mm-thick P. aeruginosa
biofilm with similar depth to full-thickness skin. No adverse toxic effects are observed after cleaning. With this success,
our overall goals are to improve biofilm removal from the infected wound using SLAM and, in turn, to promote
skin regeneration in the wound. We hypothesize that the activated MnO2-diatoms would detach biofilm from
wounds and, in turn, increase access of antibiotics to residual biofilm bacteria. The subsequently enhanced
wound disinfection would serve to improve the efficacy of regenerative medicine to skin regeneration in wounds.
We will examine this hypothesis by using the vancomycin and a pair of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF)-2 and fibroblast
growth factor (FGF)-2 as a model antibiotic and regenerative medicine, respectively. Our specific aims are to: (1)
evaluate the efficacy of activated MnO2-diatoms to remove biofilm in wounds, (2) examine if activated MnO2-
diatoms improve the efficacy of vancomycin to prevent biofilm re-growth, and (3) investigate the extent that activated
MnO2-diatoms increase the KGF2/FGF2 efficacy in stimulating skin regeneration. We will conduct each aim study using
the P. aeruginosa or methicillin-resistant S. aureus biofilm-infected excisional wound of male and female CD1
mice. We will assess the biofilm removal and skin regeneration in wounds using a multimodal optical imaging
system through collaboration with the Boppart group with expertise in bioimaging. We will also determine the matrix
metalloproteinase-9 and tissue inhibitor to metalloproteinase levels in the wound fluid, CD34+/CD45- stem cell
mobilization, pro-inflammation and edema, and minimal toxicity of SLAM under guidance by Dr. Neitzel, a dermatologist.
Overall, this proposed study will significantly impact efforts to treat non-healing, biofilm-infected wounds using
innovative SLAMs. In the end, this study will save wound patients from disability and death."

10813039,"For more than a century, radiation has been used as an effective therapeutic modality
for many different cancers and other diseases. Today, radiation therapy is clinically indicated for
more than half of all cancer patients, with the ability to provide cure, local or regional control,
and symptomatic palliation depending upon the clinical context. However, radiation can leave a
lasting mark on the normal tissues left behind. In particular, it has long been known that ionizing
radiation can promote cancer in otherwise normal tissue. While it is relatively rare for an
individual to develop a secondary malignancy (radiation-induced cancer following treatment for
a separate cancer), actual estimates of this rate vary widely according to different studies.
Furthermore, patient-level discussions of secondary malignancy rates are understandably
variable, neglect any understanding of the role of radiation dose or treatment site, and are
generally universal assumptions not tailored to the disease or the patient themselves.
 My goal is to better understand the individualized risk of cancer induced by ionizing
radiation. My central hypothesis is that individual genetic variability is likely to modify the risks of
radiation-induced malignancy. However we have poor quantitative insights and an overall
incomplete picture of the identity, nature, and effect size of genetic determinants of these risks.
The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop improved risk prediction frameworks
incorporating prospective genetic stratification. This would be invaluable for treatment-related
clinical decision-making, patient counseling, and tailoring post-radiation screening paradigms.
 I plan to test my central hypothesis by pursuing the following three Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Identify a high-confidence cohort of Veterans receiving radiation therapy
Aim 2. Characterize second and secondary malignancy rates within the VA
Aim 3. Quantify genetic risk factors of radiation-induced secondary malignancies
 To accomplish these aims, I will first implement, validate, and apply automated dose
quantification tools to national-level cohort data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW),
to extract radiotherapy details such as date, modality, dose, and fractionation, among other
clinically important radiotherapy treatment variables. I will then identify new cancer diagnos(es)
following initial cancer treatment and perform propensity matching of second cancer risk for
Veterans exposed or unexposed to radiotherapy. Moreover, I will quantify second and
presumed secondary malignancy rates among individuals as a function of estimated integral
radiation dose. Using genetic data from the Million Veteran Program (MVP), I will measure
enrichment and potential functional significance of genetic variants among a cohort of Veterans
with radiation-induced secondary malignancy. I will also identify putative DNA repair defects and
other rare variants in known cancer predisposition genes among Veterans with second cancers.
 My completion of the research described in Aims 1, 2 and 3 is expected to establish a
detailed understanding of genetic risk factors for radiation-induced malignancy. Moreover, these
Aims will establish a highly valuable cohort of veterans with curated radiotherapy and secondary
malignancy information, along with corresponding germline genetic data. Ultimately, these
resources and results are expected to have a profound impact on current radiation risk
assessment frameworks, by deepening our understanding of the interplay between individual
genetics and personalized risks."
10813010,"Project Summary
The long-term goals of this project are to develop an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that control
the function of K2P potassium channels and to identify, develop, and characterize small molecule, ion channel
modulators for the K2P family. K2Ps are a diverse family of potassium-selective channels that are responsible for
background ‘leak’ currents. These currents are pivotal in modulating the excitability of neurons. K2Ps respond to
varied stimuli that include pH changes, temperature, and mechanical force. Although K2Ps have well-established
roles in the nervous and cardiovascular systems and are implicated in pain, anesthetic responses,
thermosensation, and mood, they remain the least well-understood potassium channel class. Ion channels are
coveted drug targets. As membrane proteins, they are readily accessible to extracellular compounds and their
modulation brings about rapid changes in the properties of excitable cells in the heart and brain. However, as
membrane proteins, they also reside beyond many well-established approaches for modulator development.
Consequently, many channels, including those in the K2P family, lack significant pharmacologies. This problem
leads to a gap in our ability to connect ion channel genes with in vivo function. We are pursuing a
multidisciplinary approach that includes biophysical, structural, computational, and electrophysiological
measurements and chemical biology approaches to identify, dissect, and characterize the core elements that
control K2P function and to define and characterize new small molecules that can control K2P activity. Defining
the molecular mechanisms that control K2p activity and uncovering new K2P modulators should provide the key
framework and necessary tools for understanding how K2Ps function. Because of their important roles in human
physiology, K2Ps are targets for drugs for the treatment of chronic pain, stroke, and depression. Thus, developing
an understanding of how K2Ps function and small molecules that affect channel function should not only provide
powerful tools for dissecting K2P mechanism but should aid in the development of new therapeutic agents for a
range of human diseases."

10813017,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The striatum serves as the entry station of the basal ganglia. It mediates many critical brain functions, including
motor control, decision making, learning, and reward. In particular, the dorsolateral striatum plays essential roles
in locomotion execution and motor learning. The striatum outputs to two distinct pathways: a direct pathway that
directly innervates the output nuclei of the basal ganglia, and an indirect pathway that projects to the basal
ganglia output nuclei indirectly via related nuclei. These two pathways form a push-and-pull system, with the
direct pathway promoting movement initiation, and the indirect pathway inhibiting movement. The balance of the
push-and-pull system is critical to proper motor execution, and defective balance is associated with neurological
disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease.
The balance of the two pathways is tightly regulated by neuromodulators. Dopamine is the most studied
neuromodulator in the striatum. Locomotion intention is associated with increased dopamine release in the
striatum. Dopamine enhances the direct pathway function by upregulate intracellular cAMP concentrations and
the function of cAMP-dependent kinase in the projection neurons of this pathway, while suppressing the other
pathway by inhibiting cAMP and cAMP-dependent kinase in the projection neurons of the indirect pathway.
However, dopamine is not the only neuromodulator in the striatum. Other neuromodulators, such as adenosine,
are also known to play roles in the striatum. Adenosine receptors are abundantly expressed in the striatum.
However, it is not known whether and when adenosine is released during animal behavior, how it affects
intracellular cAMP and cAMP-dependent kinase in the projection neurons of the two pathways, and how such
effects mediate animal locomotion. Our proposal aims to answer these questions by using modern imaging or
optical measurements of the activities of both extracellular adenosine concentrations and the cell type-specific
activity of intracellular cAMP-dependent kinases in behaving mice during locomotion. Our results will add a
previously underexplored dimension to the knowledge of neuromodulation in the striatum, which may deepen
our understanding of the striatal function and dysfunction."
10813747,"ABSTRACT
Historically and for centuries, African-Americans have been among the most affected by health disparities, as
reflected in their markedly higher death rates, infant mortality, and other measures of longevity and quality of life.
One of the worst and persistent disparities in our nation affects African-American women and their children, who
bear an overwhelming burden of maternal and infant mortality and other poor maternal and child health indicators
of health-related quality of life. There is also ample evidence that minorities, and especially African-Americans,
are poorly represented among individuals receiving doctoral degrees in the biological sciences (e.g., only about
3% are African-Americans even though they represent more than 12% of the national population). African-
Americans are also disproportionately disadvantaged with respect to intramural and extramural NIH funding
awarded nationwide. Of total funding by the NIH, only 1.4% were received by African-American PI’s, and the
situation has not improved over time. A pathway to addressing this huge shortage in independently funded
African-American researchers is through a program that addresses health disparities coupled with support of
budding investigators from under-represented minorities. The Investigator Development Core (IDC) is one of
the key mechanisms by which the Maternal and Infant Environmental Health Riskscape (MIEHR) Research
Center will address this disparity to broaden the research base and enhance the Center’s impact. The IDC will
support professional development of investigators from health disparity populations interested in environmental
health disparities research. The Objective of the IDC is to stimulate, sponsor and support impactful research that
addresses environmental health disparities and promotes collaborative research among investigators from
multiple disciplines. The IDC will build on partnerships between Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and Texas
Southern University (TSU), one of the nation’s largest historically black universities in the nation, to recruit,
support and mentor post-doctoral and clinical fellows, as well as junior faculty, to pursue research in maternal
and infant environmental health. By supporting high-risk, high-impact pilot projects that explore new avenues
for research, respond to time-sensitive research opportunities, especially as they relate to disasters, and
generate preliminary data to strengthen grant applications through other funding mechanisms, the IDC will
promote career development in health disparity populations and foster collaborative research that integrates
investigators with multiple skills and talents. Key evaluative metrics of the Core will be related to how the pilot
projects ultimately help launch careers and address disparities in environmental health. Hence, the IDC is pivotal
to enhance the environmental health identity and impact of the MIEHR Center research, and in addressing the
gap in environmental health disparities researchers from health disparity populations."

10814952,"Spatially Responsive Mass Vaccination Campaigns for Urban Rabies
SUMMARY
Epidemics of vaccine-preventable zoonotic diseases are ongoing in major urban centers across Latin
America and worldwide. Mass vaccination campaigns can prevent and control epidemics of infectious
diseases among humans and animals. The realities of mass vaccination efforts, however, often fall short
of their promise. In place of high and even vaccination coverage, many campaigns leave spatial 'pockets'
of under-vaccinated individuals. Pathogens, taking advantage of these under-vaccinated areas, can
persist, diversify, and re-emerge. Modern computational approaches can mitigate geographic inequities
through the careful placement of vaccination sites, increasing demand for vaccination. However,
increased demand creates long queues for service, an additional barrier to receiving vaccination.
 The main hypothesis of our study is that participation in mass vaccination campaigns can be
significantly increased through spatially responsive vaccination strategies. These strategies have the
potential to maximize coverage, reduce spatial heterogeneity, minimize waiting time at vaccination sites,
and increase equity in access to immunization in hard-to-reach populations. We test our methods in the
context of an ongoing canine rabies epidemic in the city of Arequipa, Peru.
 In the first aim we compare the coverage and spatial equity of a new vaccination strategy,
incorporating spatial optimization and queueing theory, to current practice through a stepped-wedge
cluster randomized trial. In the second aim we develop and test data-driven methods to reach
underserved populations through mop-up “precision vaccination” campaigns. In the third aim we assess
the acceptability, scalability, and transferability of spatially responsive vaccination strategies for local,
regional, and national stakeholders.
 Our work will lead to new principles and practices that bridge operational research and zoonotic
disease epidemiology to better guide vaccination programs. It will allow for the design of effective
elimination strategies that will take into account access to healthcare and spatial behavior of vaccinators."
10814823,"Project Summary/Abstract
The essential multi-subunit RNA polymerases are regulated at each stage of the transcription
cycle to control gene expression in each Domain. In many cases the rate limiting step of gene
expression is during transcription elongation, but major knowledge gaps remain in our
understanding of post-initiation regulation of transcription. Our studies directly address
outstanding questions of transcription regulation in archaeal and eukaryotic cells. Our
overarching goals are to establish molecular mechanisms that regulate post-initiation activities
of RNAP, and establish the regulation imposed by histone-based chromatin on gene
expression. How does altering the chromatin-landscape alter gene expression? How, in
molecular detail, do factors that modify the activities of RNA polymerase accelerate transcription
on histone-bound DNA? How can the otherwise extremely stable transcription elongation
complex be disrupted to terminate transcription accurately? These complex challenges demand
continued attention to define the foundational mechanisms underlying gene expression and the
aberrant gene expression associated with disease states and cancer.
We defined that archaeal transcription and chromatin systems are closely related, yet minimal
versions of the component complex eukaryotic transcription systems. We have described the
complete archaeal transcription cycle and defined three mechanisms that control transcription
termination decisions, each of which reveals similarities with bacterial and eukaryotic
termination mechanisms and demands continued experimentation to delineate conserved
mechanisms to disrupt the transcription elongation complex. Our understanding of how
chromatin structure regulates gene expression is also incomplete. We will leverage the
simplicity of single-histone chromatin formed with native histones and histone-variants to
establish the regulation imposed by extended chromatin structures on a genome-wide level. We
will also describe the molecular activities of conserved archaeal-eukaryotic transcription factors
that modify RNA polymerase and accelerate transcription through histone-bound DNA."
10814826,"Project Summary
Recent evidence suggests that up to 10% of patients with Pancreatic Ductal AdenoCarcinoma (PDAC) harbor
a germline genetic mutation in a cancer risk gene. For this reason, the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (NCCN) and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommend germline genetic testing for
all patients with PDAC. However, the best ways to perform this testing and use the resulting information
remain unclear. As genetic testing becomes more common, critical questions need to be addressed: the
number of genes to test; whether testing causes patient distress; and the benefit of PDAC screening in healthy
mutation carriers. Answering these questions will maximize the benefit of genetic testing while minimizing the
risks of over-testing, over-screening, and inefficient use of resources.
My goal is to reduce the burden of pancreatic cancer by identifying optimal ways to execute germline genetic
testing in patients with PDAC and act on the information gained. To accomplish this goal, I will develop a
mathematical model that simulates patient genetic testing and resulting treatment selection, as well as family
member notification, genetic testing, and PDAC screening (Aim 1). I will conduct patient surveys to expand our
understanding of patient distress associated with genetic testing and communication of results to family
members (Aim 2.1). I will use the model and insights gained to determine the timing and breadth of genetic
testing that will optimize life expectancy for patients and family members (Aim 2.2). Finally, I will conduct a
cost-effectiveness analysis of germline genetic testing in PDAC that takes into account diagnosis, treatment,
and family genetic testing in an innovative structure (Aim 3). This will allow me to identify effective and high-
value genetic testing strategies for patients with PDAC, including benefits to patients and their family members.
Completion of this project will be a critical step towards my goal of becoming an independent clinician-scientist
focused in disease modeling, genetic testing, and cancer outcomes research. In addition to my ongoing role
as a clinician and teacher, I will undertake an educational program that has been specifically designed to
support this project and my career goals. I have assembled a mentorship team with unique strengths in cancer
modeling, cancer genetics, and pancreatic cancer research, all of whom are strong, independent investigators
who can guide my career development. This award will provide critical support to allow me to broaden my
knowledge base, leverage the expertise of a senior mentorship team, secure independent R01 funding, and
support my transition to independence in the years to come."
10814962,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths of American women. In particular, no
targeted therapy is clinically available for nearly all triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Cancer arises as a
result of accumulating genetic alterations. Therefore, developing novel strategies to precisely target the genetic
alterations of TNBC may be valuable for combating the malignant disease. TP53 is a pivotal tumor suppressor
gene inactivated by mutation or deletion in most human cancers. Tremendous effort has been made to restore
the activity of the p53 protein encoded by TP53 for cancer treatment. Unfortunately, no p53-based therapy has
been successfully translated into the clinic, due to the complexity of p53 signaling. Therefore, identifying
vulnerabilities conferred by TP53 deletion instead of restoring the p53 activity is a novel strategy for combating
cancer. In our recent work published in Nature and Nature Nanotechnology, we revealed genomic deletion of
TP53 is often accompanied by hemizygous (i.e., partial) loss of a neighboring gene POLR2A essential for cell
survival, and virtually all 53% TNBCs with TP53 deletion harbor hemizygous POLR2A loss (TP53/POLR2Aloss).
 Our preliminary data show that suppressing POLR2A expression by RNA interference with small interfering
RNA (siRNA) delivered using a low pH-activated nanobomb selectively inhibits the proliferation, survival, and
tumorigenic potential of TP53/POLR2Aloss TNBC cells. The nanobomb protects the siRNA in blood and enables
endo/lysosomal escape of the siRNA into the cytosol where the siRNA performs its POLR2A inhibition function
after cell uptake. Moreover, the nanobomb-mediated delivery of POLR2A-targeting siRNA selectively inhibits
the growth of orthotopic TP53/POLR2Aloss TNBC tumors, with no evident systemic toxicity demonstrated by the
data on animal body weight and blood proteins (for liver function) and cytokines (for immune responses).
 However, a small fraction of breast cancer cells overexpressed with the variant CD44 (note: not the non-
variant or normal CD44 on normal stem cells) have been shown to be particularly resistant to clinically used
chemotherapy drugs of TNBC such as paclitaxel (PTX). Since POLR2A is indispensable for cancer cells to
survive, we hypothesize that targeted co-delivery of the POLR2A-targeting siRNA and PTX to the variant
CD44+ cancer cells can overcome the TNBC drug resistance. We will further develop the aforementioned low
pH-activated nanobomb that has no active targeting, to be capable of actively targeting both the variant CD44+
cells and tumor vasculature. Since cancer metastasis is the major cause of cancer-related death, we will test
the hypothesis using not only the aforementioned orthotopic/primary TNBC tumors but also metastatic TNBC
model. Furthermore, we will investigate the mechanisms of resistance to the POLR2A-targeted therapy using
not only 2D and xenograft but also 3D TNBC models generated using microfluidic approach developed by us.
Collectively, this project may result in a novel therapy for drug-resistant TNBC with mechanistic understanding,
which is invaluable for combating TNBC and possibly many other types of cancers harboring TP53 deletion."
10814964,"The goal of our studies is to better understand the mechanisms by which tau transmission and neuronal hyperexcitability drive the progression of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Related Dementias
(ADRD) that include Down Syndrome (DS) caused by trisomy of chromosome 21 (Ts21). Our studies are in line
with the goals of RFA PAR-18-706 because we will focus on understanding “mechanisms underlying selective cell sensitivity to tau cell-to-cell spread in circuitry.” The foundation of our studies is that tau is a prime culprit in pathogenesis of ADRDs such as DS because tau is a major component of neurofibrillary tangles in DS brains and polymorphisms in the tau gene MAPT increase risk of AD and AD in Ts21 patients. Neuropathology in ADRD follows a temporal and spatial progression in brain, and there is growing evidence that the progressive neurodegeneration in ADRD is due to transsynaptic spread of tau via connected neurons. In addition to tau, neuronal hyperexcitability can occur at early stages of ADRD, and some have proposed that network dysfunction may be a driving force for neurodegeneration in ADRDs. We will investigate if altered neuronal activity due to overexpression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) caused by Ts21 contributes to the transsynaptic spread of tau, increasing the rate of neurodegeneration. We will use a multidisciplinary approach to study how APP overexpression found in ADRDs affects transmission of tau and impacts human brain circuitry. We will co-culture organoids and transplant human iPSC-derived cortical neurons from ADRD patients (tauP301L or Ts21) with control human cortical organoids or human fetal cortical slices and monitor the impact on neuronal circuits using a novel time lapse, imaging platform, four-dimensional robotic microscopy (4DRM). 4DRM will track functional properties of individual neurons in 4D in human primary brain slices over weeks, to give insight into how APP overexpression, hyperexcitability, and tau transmission interact to cause neurodegeneration. The ability to monitor neuronal circuitry in organoids and human brain slices longitudinally is innovative and critical in studying the slow degenerative processes that may be induced by tau transmission. We will use 4DRM in combination with multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis to determine if network hyperexcitability and tau aggregation is detrimental, beneficial or inconsequential towards neuronal survival. To complement these in vitro studies, we developed an in vivo whole animal model of tauopathy in which transgenic zebrafish larvae overexpress human tauP301L in their nervous system and use 4DRM to monitor neuronal circuitry in the living animals. The GFP-tauP301L zebrafish model shows increased p-tau but no overt neuronal dysfunction, or neurodegeneration. When hyperexcitability is induced, the fish display sensitivity to neuronal death and behavioral signs of neurodegeneration. With this model, we will investigate the effect of hyperexcitability on aggregation of tau and
mechanisms of tau transmission in vivo. By understanding mechanisms of tau transmission, we can develop strategies to block spread of neuropathology to slow the progression of AD."

a relative paucity of structural information for RNAs, which comprise <2% of structures deposited in the Protein
Data Bank. NMR is an important tool in RNA structure determination, contributing ~35% of the deposited RNA
structures, and is uniquely capable of probing RNA dynamics on functionally relevant timescales in solution.
Computational techniques are also essential for reliable simulation of nucleic acids, integration of experimental
data from different sources, and comparison of models with experimental data at increasingly long timescales.
The NMR, Computation and Dynamics Core therefore brings together investigators from seven institutions who
have extensive and complementary expertise in applying and developing leading edge techniques for studying
the structure, interactions, and dynamics of RNA using NMR and advanced computational tools. Core
investigators are developing methods to probe increasingly large RNAs, tag RNAs with unique isotopic labels,
and determine the atomic resolution structures of RNA dynamic ensembles. These technologies will be applied
to challenging RNA systems to illuminate the role of HIV-1 RNA structural complexes in viral transcription,
splicing, nuclear export, translation, packaging, and particle assembly. In addition, the Core will provide general
NMR screening services, including design and preparation of isotopically labeled RNAs, data acquisition and
analysis, and will help all CRNA Research Projects make effective use of state-of-the-art tools in computational
structure calculation and refinement."
10789944,"ABSTRACT
The innate immune response, particularly the interferon (IFN) response, is the first line of defense against viral
infections. This response includes upregulation of hundreds of IFN stimulate genes (ISGs), some of which have
antiviral properties. Several ISGs are known to inhibit HIV in cell culture models, but there is little data on whether
these or other ISGs are active against HIV in biologically relevant systems or indeed whether they are even
present in HIV infected individuals and thus capable of impacting HIV replication in that context. This is because
it is unknown which ISGs are induced by HIV infection and thus likely to contribute to the early antiviral response
to HIV. We propose to address these gaps in this key area of HIV pathogenesis research by defining the ISGs
that are present in early HIV infection and by comprehensively defining the ISGs that can inhibit HIV in the major
target cell of infection, CD4+ T lymphocytes. We will examine the early IFN signature to HIV, both the ISGs that
dominate overall - and thus may represent the major challenge to the establishment of HIV persistence - as well
as the specific ISGs expressed by key innate effector cells such as NK cells. This will provide the first detailed
view of the IFN antiviral response in humans exposed to HIV. A particularly critical aspect that enables this
innovative work is the Mombasa Cohort, a long-term open cohort study of sex workers at risk for HIV that is the
longest standing cohort of high-risk women globally. We will pair this with testing the specific antiviral properties
of ISGs identified in this setting as well as those identified in a CRISPR/Cas9 inactivation screen in primary T
lymphocytes to define their effects on HIV replication. We will do this using biologically relevant cells and
transmitted viruses so that our studies are optimized to understand HIV transmission in humans. Studies in
primary T cells with viruses that are spreading to humans will advance our current knowledge in this area, which
has long focused on the inhibitory effects of ISGs in cell lines with lab-adapted viruses because of the challenges
of human studies and studies in biologically relevant culture systems. We are well poised for this work because
of the considerable optimization we have done to make large scale CRISPR/Cas9 inactivation screens in primary
T lymphocytes feasible, our newly developed methods to study the NK antiviral response to HIV infection and
our experience with RNA-seq methods. This proposal is novel in drilling down to define which of the ISGs present
in early HIV infection are functionally important for restricting HIV replication. Defining these host antiviral
effectors will provide mechanistic insights that may in turn open avenues to harness the virus/host arms race in
favor of the host."
10789891,"Pain is a sensation realized by every individual at some point in his or her lives. Different causes of pain result in treatment by administration of drugs ranging from aspirin to morphine as the current standard of care. Morphine targets the opioid receptors as its  “on-target” mechanism of action. Unfortunately, prolonged treatment of pain with
morphine causes many adverse effects such as addiction, tolerance, nausea, sedation, respiratory depression, constipation, and others. Thus, understanding the different mechanisms for pain perception, discovery of new molecular targets to treat pain with minimal undesired side effects, and the discovery and development of new therapeutic
agents for the alleviation of pain is an on going effort by the scientific community world- wide. The goal of this research project is to characterize the unexplored human opioid receptor N-terminal domain peptides as a new chemotype for the treatment of pain and how they modulate opioid receptor pharmacology. The impact of the anticipated results
on the medicinal chemistry and pain research fields could advance the existing paradigms for ligand design strategies for opioid peptide based therapeutics, GPCR based therapeutics, as well as provide novel tools to probe the molecular mechanisms of pain management."
10789894,"Abstract: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) dramatically reduces HIV-associated morbidity and mortality (1).
However, it is not a practical cure as eradication of HIV through ART alone is estimated to require over 60 years
of treatment (1, 2). Numerous studies support that HIV-specific T cell responses are critical for efficient targeting
and elimination of HIV infected cells that are the source of chronic infection (3-10). Unfortunately, viral escape
and a limited presence of functional virus-specific effector CD8+ T cells undermine the potency of these
responses in chronically infected individuals (11-17). As such, there is growing interest in the development of
novel immunotherapeutic approaches to target and eliminate HIV-infected cells to achieve viral
suppression in the absence of ART, a “functional cure”.
 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell immunotherapies have demonstrated great promise against
blood cancers (18-20), and now also demonstrate the potential to mitigate HIV/SIV infection in rhesus macaques
(21, 22) and humanized mice (23-28). We recently showed that HIV-specific Dual CD4-based CAR T cells co-
expressing independent 4-1BB and CD28 costimulatory domains restrict HIV replication and reduce viral burden
in humanized mice (23). However, current limitations of using autologous T cells to derive CAR T cell products
(TCPs), including time-consuming and costly manufacturing, insufficient or dysfunctional patient-derived T cells,
and the inter-patient heterogeneity of TCPs, are barriers to their widespread application to human diseases.
Development of allogeneic TCPs derived from healthy human donors, could, however, provide an ‘off-the-shelf’
treatment option to overcome these hurdles, as well as accelerate the use of CAR T cell therapies (29-38).
Unfortunately, post-infusion elimination by the recipient’s immune system remains a major hurdle (39-41).
 Here we propose to leverage our expertise in CAR T cell biology (21, 23, 25, 26, 42, 43), base editing
(44-49), and a humanized mouse model of HIV infection (50-58) to develop an allogeneic CAR T cell therapy
against HIV. Building on our preliminary data applying efficient multiplex base editing to CAR T cells, we
hypothesize that both base editing approaches and identification of an optimal allogenic donor will enable the
development of an allorejection-resistant CD4-based CAR TCP with enhanced efficacy to eliminate HIV-infected
cells and suppress HIV in the absence of ART. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Determine whether genetic modifications to allogeneic T cells can augment their in vivo
persistence.
Aim 2: Identify characteristics of allogeneic HIV-specific CD4CAR T cells that associate with enhanced
 persistence and antiviral efficacy.
Aim 3: Compare the in vivo HIV efficacy of allogeneic versus autologous HIV-specific CD4CAR T cells,
incorporating Aim 1 and 2’s signatures of improved allogeneic functionality."
10789896,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Neonatal seizures due to brain injury (acute symptomatic seizures) are associated with high risk of post-
neonatal epilepsy. Although clinical risk factors can help predict which children are at highest risk for epilepsy,
little is known about how genetic factors modify the risk for epilepsy after acute symptomatic neonatal seizures.
The proposed “Neonatal Seizure Registry – GENetics of Epilepsy (NSR-GENE)” study will test the central
hypothesis that children who develop post-neonatal epilepsy are more likely to have pathogenic variants in
epilepsy genes, and enrichment in single nucleotide polymorphisms within key inflammatory, neurotransmitter
transport and homeostasis, and neurotrophic gene pathways as compared with children who do not develop
unprovoked seizures before age five years, and that these can be added to traditional clinical risk factors to
predict epilepsy after neonatal seizures.
This observational study leverages the infrastructure of the nine center Neonatal Seizure Registry, to which we
have recruited >300 children with acute symptomatic neonatal seizures (NCT02789176, NCT04337697). This
unique cohort of children and their parents will be invited to participate in non-invasive genetic testing. Using
neonatal clinical, EEG, and MRI measures available through the Registry, along with genetic testing results,
we will build robust models to predict risk of epilepsy and elucidate mechanisms of epileptogenesis.
We will test our hypotheses by pursuing the following specific aims: Aim 1: Determine whether there is an
increased incidence of pathogenic coding SNVs and gene rich CNVs within epilepsy genes among children with
acute provoked neonatal seizures and post-neonatal epilepsy compared to those without subsequent epilepsy;
Aim 2: Determine whether an increased incidence of non-coding SNPs with a priori linkage to epilepsy is
associated with the risk of post-neonatal epilepsy; Aim 3 Develop prediction rules to stratify neonates based on
risk for post-neonatal epilepsy.
This innovative proposal will maintain an existing, multicenter cohort enrolled from US centers that employ
state-of-the-art technology for diagnosis and investigation of neonatal seizures, and targets research priorities
of parents and clinicians. This carefully designed study will provide novel, clinically relevant answers to key
questions about epilepsy in this highly vulnerable patient population. Results will inform the subsequent design
of intervention studies and programs designed to reduce the risk of epilepsy after early life seizures."

NF-B plays a causative role in the inflammation and pathogenesis of various diseases such as lung disease,
the third leading killer in the United States responsible for one in seven deaths. However, we have been unable
to successfully target it for clinical treatment due to its equally important roles in physiology, and in particular,
innate immunity and host defense. Teasing apart these functions of NF-B will overcome this barrier resulting
in a powerful means to fight lung and other diseases. Although the core mechanism driving NF-B activation
has been well defined and is the same under most physiological and pathogenic conditions, the mechanistic
difference in physiologic versus pathogenic NF-B remains largely unknown. Recently, we have demonstrated,
for the first time, that NF-B exhibits different activation patterns in normal and malignant lung epithelial cells,
the first line of defense and a key component of the innate immunity in the lung. Furthermore, we have revealed,
also for the first time, the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein PDLIM2 as a tumor suppressor and ubiquitin E3
ligase that selectively degrades the ‘pathogenic’ form but not the ‘physiologic’ form of NF-B (thereby preventing
pathogenic activation while allowing physiologic activation of NF-B by inflammatory stimuli) and can be targeted
as mono- or combination therapy in authentic mouse models of human lung cancer. Like in human lung cancer,
of note, PDLIM2 is repressed in the lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or
interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), and PDLIM2 repression is associated with disease severity and poor patient
survival. Lung epithelial-specific or global deletion of PDLIM2 renders mice highly susceptible to spontaneous
and induced lung cancers as well as acute lung injury and death by the bacteria endotoxin lipopolysaccharide
(LPS). Based on these trailblazing discoveries, in this proposal we will identify the functional partners of PDLIM2
and determine the structural and biochemical mechanisms by which they act as a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex to
dichotomize the differential activation of NF-B in lung epithelial cells. We will also determine in vivo and in vitro
the roles and molecular mechanisms of this regulation in lung disease and host defense against pulmonary
infection using conditional and inducible knockout (KO) or knock-in (KI) mice and cells of PDLIM2 and/or NF-B.
These studies will improve our understanding of normal lung physiology and pulmonary diseases, and open new
avenues to study NF-B regulation and action. They may also lead to new clinically feasible approaches to
selectively target pathogenic NF-B and reveal new therapeutic targets for better lung disease treatment."

Astrocytes control neurotransmission, contribute to the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), and shape inflammatory
responses. In healthy aging, many aspects of astrocyte function are altered but what drives aging-related
changes is not well understood. Here, we present exciting preliminary data that during normal aging,
astrocytes take on a novel phenotype in which progressively more astrocytes lose the expression of key
functional proteins. We refer to these as atypical astrocytes (AtAs). AtAs lack expression of excitatory amino
acid transporters (EAATs: GLT-1 and GLAST), that remove glutamate from the extracellular space, Kir4.1, which
mediates extracellular potassium (K+) buffering, and aquaporin-4 (AQP-4), which helps clear A from the brain.
These changes occur on a cell-by-cell basis, with individual astrocytes expressing minimal EAAT, Kir4.1, and
AQP-4, while neighboring astrocytes remain normal. AtAs do not appear to be reactive astrocytes as they lack
elevated GFAP expression and have normal astrocyte morphology. Preliminary iGluSnFR and astrocyte
electrophysiology data suggest that glutamate and K+ homeostasis is compromised in areas where AtAs are
abundant. What causes AtA to form is not known, but published and preliminary studies suggest AtAs are
associated with vascular structures and are found in areas of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) compromise. Our
preliminary data also suggests that AtAs are found in the aging human brain and are more abundant in the
APPNL-G-F model of AD, as compared to WT mice. Therefore, we hypothesize that age-associated vascular
dysfunction drives the formation of AtAs, disrupting astrocyte function and contributing to synaptic and
AD-related pathology. Astrocyte dysfunction occurs late in AD progression, but how astrocytes contribute to
early AD pathology is not well understood. We suspect AtAs occur early in AD progression and contribute
to diverse AD disease mechanisms. Evidence supports that aberrant glutamate signaling contributes to AD
progression. Disrupted AQP-4 expression is a hallmark of AD and associated with reduced A clearance.
Vascular dysfunction is an AD risk factor and astrocytes contribute to BBB integrity. To examine AtAs in a model
of AD, we chose the APPNL-G-F mice due to early onset of elevated soluble A and plaques overlapping with the
normal development of AtAs, without APP overexpression. If our hypothesis is correct, AtAs may be a central
player in aging and AD-related pathologies linking vascular dysfunction to synaptic and A pathology. In this
proposal we will determine 1) What are the molecular and cellular phenotypes of AtAs in the aging and AD
brain?, 2) Do AtAs disrupt synaptic function, ionic homeostasis, and A handling?, and 3) Does BBB
dysfunction contribute to the generation of AtAs? When complete, we will know the molecular and cellular
properties of age-associated AtAs, their effects on astrocyte-mediated homeostasis, and their relationship with
BBB dysfunction. If AtAs mediate astrocyte-neuron dysfunction caused by age-related vascular pathology, it will
represent an entirely new avenue to pursue for treating AD and other age-related neurological disease."

Prevalence of pulmonary disease due to non-tuberculous mycobacteria in the United States has doubled in the
last 10 years, and Mycobacterium avium pulmonary disease (MAC-PD) is the most common. Treatment requires
≥3 antibiotics for >12 months and efficacy remain low. Given this intense treatment regimen and limited efficacy,
antibiotic therapy is not always advisable. In fact, ~50% of patients will attain culture conversion with observation
alone or with bronchial hygiene treatments. There is currently no way to predict which patients will improve with
or without antibiotic treatment. The result of this uncertainty is prolonged ineffective treatment which risks side
effects, drive drug resistance and extend treatment duration. We propose an interdisciplinary approach that
combines clinical, immunological and pharmacological data. We will integrate these datasets from retrospective
and prospective cohorts using machine learning and mechanistic computational simulations with the goal of
developing a disease progression risk score (DP-RS) for patients managed without antibiotics (Aim 1), and a
treatment failure risk score (TF-RS) for patients treated with guidelines-based antibiotic regimens (Aim 2). Such
risk scores can help to predict patients at risk of disease progression without antibiotics or treatment failure with
antibiotics, so they can be prioritized for closer observation or intensified treatment, respectively.
For patients who do not receive antibiotics (Aim 1) we will a) use retrospective clinical data from Indiana, Florida
and Minnesota to train and test random forest algorithms to predict disease progression and validate our predic-
tions against prospective clinical cohorts from Florida and Minnesota; b) identify antigen specific T cells re-
sponses associated with disease progression; c) predict tissue-level disease progression based on patient-spe-
cific T-cell responses using mechanistic computational models; and d) train and test simulation assisted random
forest (SARF) algorithms that integrate clinical, immunological and computational data to predict disease pro-
gression and derive the DP-RS.
For patients who receive antibiotics (Aim 2) we will a) use retrospective clinical data (Indiana, Florida, Minnesota)
to train and test random forest algorithms to predict treatment failure and validate our predictions against pro-
spective clinical cohorts (Florida, Minnesota); b) identify antigen specific T cells responses associated with treat-
ment failure; c) identify serum and bronchoalveolar lavage pharmacokinetics associated with treatment failure;
d) predict tissue-level treatment response based on patient-specific T-cell responses and pharmacokinetics us-
ing mechanistic computational models; and d) train and test SARF algorithms that integrate clinical, immunolog-
ical, pharmacological and computational data to predict treatment failure and derive the TF-RS.
Together, this work will provide fundamental insights into clinical, immunological and pharmacological contribu-
tors to MAC-PD disease progression and treatment response, as well as provide predictive risk scores (DP-RS
and TF-RS) that will translate into precision medicine management tools, helpful for clinicians and patients."

Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child
health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the country,
a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years, under
RFA-DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the consortium, and
will track their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health,
and culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual
interviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of
developmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and
parents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through
adolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our
understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping)
interact with each other and with a child's changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral,
academic, health, and other outcomes.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen
time, sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences influence brain development; (5)
determine and replicate factors that influence mental health from childhood to young adulthood; (6)
characterize relationships between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of substances
such as cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine affects developmental outcomes, and how neural, cognitive,
emotional, and environmental factors influence the risk for adolescent substance use."

NRG Oncology (NRG) has made significant progress toward its goal of improving the lives of
adults with certain non-hematologic malignancies through its clinical and translational research
efforts. NRG's defined patient populations of interest - those with gender-specific malignancies
and/or those with localized or locally advanced disease, are unique within the NCTN,
constituting a large and relatively under-investigated cohort of cancer patients. Positioned to be
the lead NCTN research organization for trials enrolling several patient cohorts, NRG's portfolio
focuses on patients with gynecologic cancer, primary or secondary brain tumors, head and neck
cancer, or localized or locally advanced prostate cancer as well as breast cancer, lung cancer,
gastrointestinal cancer, bladder cancer, or sarcoma. In these and other realms NRG, actively
collaborates with other NCTN groups, diligently working to increase awareness of and
participation in all NCTN trials.
NRG's research accomplishments to date have been extraordinary. There have been 87 CTEP-
supported NRG trials open for enrollment during this period, representing 34% of the open
NCTN adult trials. For the period March 1, 2014 through August 31, 2017, NRG members
entered 10,840 patients onto NRG-led trials, 3,199 patients into trials led by other NCTN
network groups, and an additional 1,906 patients onto NCTN Precision Medicine Trials for a
total of 15,945 entries. Of the 48,056 total NCTN treatment enrollments, NRG's contribution
accounts for 33% of the total entries and represents the largest accrual of any of the five NCTN
groups. Of patients enrolled onto NRG trials at U.S. sites, 12.7% were self-identified as of
African descent and 8.0% as Latino or Hispanic.
There have been 302 NRG peer-reviewed manuscripts published or in press and 365 published
abstracts during this period, of which at least 52 contain practice-changing or practice-defining
observations. To successfully fulfill its ambitious goal, NRG has seven cancer disease site
committees, all with internationally recognized multi-disciplinary leadership and all with strong
liaison representatives from NRG's nine scientific core committees. There are four other
protocol-generating committees and five administrative committees, all designed to lead and
support critical areas of the group's research. NRG is organized such that the necessary
operational efficiencies and internal peer review are in order to overcome barriers to conducting
a broad portfolio of scientifically important and relevant clinical trials and to ensuring appropriate
enrollment to these trials."

The U-RISE program will be located at Fayetteville State University (FSU), which is one of the 17
constituent institutions of the University of North Carolina System and the second oldest public
institution of higher education in the state. The U-RISE program will be a research training program
comprised of a series of evidence-based, phased-in awareness, mentoring and developmental activities
designed to help students succeed in college, and transition into biomedical, research-focused, higher
degree programs upon graduation.
Underrepresented minority (URM) students from biology, chemistry, forensic science, math, and
computer science majors will engage in intensive research training and professional development
activities beginning at the college sophomore year through their acceptance into graduate schools. Each
year of program matriculation, trainees will develop new skills and experiences to become more
competitive applicants for graduate schools. In light of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, alternative
virtual training activities have been proposed in the event future face-to-face meetings are prohibited.
Based upon institutional assessments and the previous successful design of the FSU-RISE program,
this application proposes to establish a U-RISE program at FSU with an overarching goals to develop
an increased talent pool of well-trained URM students in biology, chemistry, forensic science and math
and computer science in which at least 90% (27 of 30) will graduate with baccalaureate degrees from
FSU with at least a 3.0 GPA; and at least 75% (23 of 30) will transition into biomedical, research-
focused higher degree programs within the 5 years of funding. The following three objectives are
proposed to achieve these goals:
 1. To enhance the academic preparation of URM trainees in biology, chemistry, forensic
 science, mathematics, and computer science such that each year
 2. To provide meaningful research training experiences to develop a well-prepared URM
 trainee pool of research-ready, critical and independent thinkers for competitive entry into
 biomedical research-focused higher degree programs each year
 3. To engage trainees in cohort-building interventions each year to enhance self-efficacy and
 biomedical research-focused higher degree identity
Trainees will be selected through a competitive application process, which includes meeting program
criteria and performing well in an interview. Longitudinal, mixed-methods formative and summative
evaluations will be conducted to evaluate measures/benchmarks and program effectiveness."
10816556,"Tau is a central player in the pathogenesis of numerous age-related neurodegenerative diseases,
with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) being the best example. Tau from AD brain is defined by aberrant
posttranslational modifications (PTMs), including increases in phosphorylation and acetylation at
specific epitopes. The UNDERLYING PREMISE of this proposal is that specific, disease relevant PTMs
impair tau function which negatively impacts neuronal health. While the formation of insoluble fibrillary
structures is influenced by PTMs, data strongly indicate that soluble forms of abnormally modified tau are
the mediators of neuronal toxicity. There are data indicating that overexpression of AD-relevant forms of
tau results in increased levels of fragmented, dysfunctional mitochondria, which may be due to in part
due to impaired mitophagy, as well as other perturbations of mitochondrial quality control (MQC)
mechanisms. However, a CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE GAP is how these modified tau species, when
present at physiologically relevant levels, influence mitochondrial and neuronal health. The OVERALL
HYPOTHESIS of this proposal is that tau with AD-relevant PTMs exerts toxic effects through impairing MQC
mechanisms. An impaired ability to resolve mitochondrial stress would increase the presence of less
functional mitochondria with a concomitant increase in oxidative stress and neuronal dysfunction. The
overall result would be an earlier onset of an aged neuron phenotype. The NOVELTY of this project stems
in part from its use of single-copy transgenic tau models that avoid overexpression, as well as the
inclusion of age as a variable in a genetic model organism. The nematode C. elegans benefits
from a vast repertoire of genetic, transgenic and genomic resources that will be leveraged to investigate the
molecular underpinnings of AD and to define the precise mechanism through which tau PTMs
compromise mitochondrial function and accelerate neuronal aging. Our preliminary data support this
approach as worms with single copy expression of tau with specific AD-relevant PTMs in
mechanosensory neurons show a significant increase in age-dependent neurodegeneration and a suppression
of stress-induced mitophagy. These and other preliminary data provide a strong foundation for the studies
in this application. The aims of this proposal are: (1) To determine the impact of AD relevant tau PTMs
on mitochondrial stress responses and how this influences healthy aging of neurons, (2) To test the
hypothesis that tau with AD relevant PTMs impairs mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy, and (3) To
address whether enhancing MQC is a viable therapeutic avenue. The relative contribution of these responses
to neuronal age-dependent deficits will be tested using unique genetic resources available in worms. The
IMPACT of these studies will be to provide crucial new insights into the mechanisms by which
pathological tau species compromise mitochondrial function and neuronal health."

10823677,"Project Summary
The mammalian cortex consists of many transcriptionally distinct neuronal cell types connected in intricate
circuits. Much work has shown that risk genes associated with developmental disorders such as schizophrenia,
autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy and intellectual disorder encode synaptic proteins enriched in cortical
interneurons (cIN). However, not much is known about how cINs integrate into cortical circuits during
development. Thus, understanding how this process occurs will allow us to understand how the cortex develops
in both healthy and pathophysiological states. Early studies used electrophysiological and morphological
analysis to define four cardinal classes of interneurons with varying levels of heterogeneity within those classes.
More recent advances in single-cell, spatial and combinatorial transcriptomic techniques have uncovered an
even wider breadth of diversity. The somatostatin (SST) class is of particular interest because they are enriched
in infragranular layers of the cortex yet display highly specialized targeting of pyramidal neuron dendrites. This
requires them to extend their axons across multiple layers to connect to their synaptic partners. Their role in
routing feedback inhibition suggests that they influence dendritic computations in pyramidal neurons (PNs) by
regulating information flow. Proper maturation of cortex requires SST interneurons to successfully integrate into
cortical circuits, yet the cellular and subcellular specificity in efferent targeting of SST interneuron subtypes is
currently unknown. The molecular and genetic tools that have been generated and validated in our lab has
positioned me to utilize slice physiology, immunohistochemistry and viral labeling methods to not only investigate
the specificity in SST subtype connectivity, but also to evaluate how this arises in development. As yet, it is
unknown whether SST efferent targeting is initially specific or refined across development. Furthermore, recent
work has shown that SST interneurons transiently target PV interneurons during development and that this is
instructive to the formation of PV microcircuits. Thus, it is likely that SST circuit integration is dynamic across
development. Therefore, I also aim to determine how SST efferent specificity arises and whether transient
connectivity’s exist across development. However, the study of the assembly of cortical microcircuits must
consider developmental activity, as much work has uncovered the dependance of interneuron maturation and
circuit integration on intrinsic activity. Given the incredible advances in transcriptomics clarifying the diversity
within the SST interneuron class, and the viral and transgenic tools that now exist to target, label and manipulate
specific cortical neuron subtypes, we are now well positioned to assess the role of developmental intrinsic activity
on synaptic specificity. Thus, in my final set of experiments, I will determine the role of developmental activity in
SST circuit integration and the critical period for this activity in proper synaptic maturation of SST subtype-specific
microcircuits. The project that I have proposed is designed to fill the gap in knowledge of how SST subtypes
integrate and function in specific microcircuits and lay the foundation for future mechanistic studies."

Intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs) are critical regulatory modules for many processes in the
eukaryotic cell, such as transcription regulation and cell cycle control. Many diseases are characterized by
dysregulation of the proteins involved in these processes, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancers.
Post-translational modifications (PTMs), like phosphorylation, within IDRs can control their conformational
states and intermolecular interactions toward a specific functional outcome; as such, a molecular-level
understanding of the effects of phosphorylation and other PTMs on IDR behavior will advance the development
of therapeutic strategies targeted to these regulatory proteins and their modifications. The project proposed
herein centers on the C-terminal IDR of the Retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and its multi-site phosphorylation
associated with cell cycle progression. Rb functions and their dysregulation in cancers have been studied
extensively, but the specific mechanistic consequences of phosphorylation on the C-terminal IDR (CTD) that
support Rb control of the cell cycle are not clear. Therefore, this study will test the hypothesis that Rb-CTD
undergoes both global and local conformational changes associated with multi-site phosphorylation.
This project leverages tandem computational and experimental approaches to overcome technical challenges
associated with the structural characterization of IDRs. Specifically, all-atom simulations and solution-state
biophysical measurements will reveal the atomistic details of Rb IDR behavior with and without multi-site
phosphorylation. Aim 1 will expand on the existing infrastructure for molecular simulations of IDRs by
development and incorporation of parameters for phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that Rb phosphorylation confers functional switching by affecting the IDR conformations presented
to putative binding partners. A strategic combination of all-atom simulations, NMR spectroscopy, and
single-molecule fluorescence will provide quantitative details about the conformations preferred by unmodified
or phosphorylated Rb-CTD. Finally, Aim 3 will interrogate a known interaction between phosphorylated
Rb-CTD and an adjacent Rb folded domain. In this aim, small-angle X-ray scattering and NMR spectroscopy
experiments will be used to test the hypothesis that electrostatic forces introduced through phosphorylation
drive the intramolecular interaction of Rb in cis.
Together, the research and training objectives outlined in this proposal strongly align with the mission of the
NIH to understand the mechanisms of disease and to foster the future generation of academic investigators in
biomedical science. Further, the completion of these studies will provide valuable insights into the basic
biophysical underpinnings of Rb- and other IDR-linked diseases."

Intracellular sensors of nucleic acids are essential for host defense, but they can also cause specific human
autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases if they are not carefully regulated. Over the past 15 years, a
paradigm has emerged in which thresholds for activation of these sensors are set by cellular enzymes that
metabolize or modify endogenous nucleic acids, thus preventing self-reactivity. The most potent of these
enzymes is ADAR1, an RNA editing enzyme that deaminates adenosines in RNA. Mutations in the human
ADAR gene that encodes ADAR1 cause Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome, a severe disease characterized by
inappropriate production of type I interferons (IFNs). In previous work, we demonstrated that ADAR1 is an
essential and specific regulator of the MDA5-MAVS pathway of antiviral defense. However, the precise
relationships between ADAR1 RNA, MDA5 activation, and disease remain incompletely understood because of
the lack of tools to study this process in vivo. We have generated three new mouse models to advance our
understanding of ADAR1 biology and the broader regulation of the type I IFN response: a knockin mouse
model of the most common ADAR AGS allele in humans, a MDA5-HA epitope tag knockin mouse to track
MDA5 activation in live cells, and a new Ifnb knockin reporter mouse to enable screens for novel regulators of
the type I IFN response. We will use these tools to define the mechanisms that underlie ADAR1-controlled
disease in vivo, the precise relationship between ADAR1 RNA editing and MDA5 activation, and the scope of
IFN regulation in primary cells. Our studies will uncover fundamental new insights into ADAR1 biology and will
identify novel targets that can be manipulated for therapeutic benefit, with direct relevance to human disease."

Annually, pancreatic cancer (PC) has a global incidence of more than 495,000 cases and a mortality rate
of almost 460,000 cases. Most of these patients (~80%) receive late-stage diagnoses when their tumors
cannot be surgically resected, necessitating pharmacotherapy. A majority of PC patients (81%) have
dense, fibrous stroma tissue surrounding their tumors, which is a negative prognostic. Despite treatment,
PC has the lowest 5-year survival rate of all cancers.
Nanomedicines have been developed for use in oncology to reduce toxicity and improve efficacy. Indeed,
drugs like protein-bound paclitaxel nanomedicine (Nab-PTX, Abraxane) and liposomal irinotecan (Nal-
IRI, Onivyde) have led to dramatic improvements in response rates for cancers such as breast, lun g, and
leukemia. However, nanomedicines’ efficacy gains in PC have fallen far short of those seen in other
indications. This stems in part from PC’s stromal tissue that blocks the extravasation and penetration of
large nanomedicines like Nab-PTX and Nal-IRI (> 100nm).
To overcome the delivery challenges of existing nanomedicines, Duo Oncology is developing DUO-
207, an ultrasmall nanoparticle (< 30 nm) comprised of a copolymer-conjugated gemcitabine
(PGEM) that encapsulates paclitaxel (PTX). DUO-207’s fixed dose combination delivers the active
moieties in GEM and Nab-PTX, a current standard of care (SoC) for advanced PC. DUO-207 contains four
innovations that address gaps in this SoC therapy to optimize safety, efficacy, and convenience. 1) The
patent-pending polymer chemistry behind PGEM protects GEM from rapid inactivation via cytidine
deaminase in the blood and liver. Clinically, large doses of GEM are administered to compensate for rapid
inactivation and increase the drug’s bioavailability to tumor tissue but this approach contributes to dose
limiting toxicity. 2) In DUO-207, GEM is conjugated to the polymer, facilitating its controlled gradual
release and providing prolonged exposure to GEM, which has been associated with improved clinical
efficacy. 3) The bonds that link GEM to the polymer are sensitive to three conditions common to the tumor
microenvironment, thereby aiding the release of GEM adjacent to cancer cells. 4) Lastly, our novel
polymer chemistry allows for the self-assembly of 14nm PGEM micelles that can accommodate high drug
loading of PTX in a single i.v. infusion. DUO-207’s ultrasmall size allows for its effective penetration of and
accumulation in tumor tissue as demonstrated in our preclinical orthotopic model of PC using genetically
engineered Kras-Pdx1-Cre (KPC) cells that produce dense stroma.
In this application we propose to perform murine toxicology and tumor growth studies to build a safety and
efficacy profile for DUO-207 compared to current Soc. Ultimately, the innovations of DUO-207 will improve
survival outcomes, the toxicity profile, and quality of life for patients suffering from advanced PC."
10822260,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This is an F31 application from Robert Hall, who is a predoctoral student in the Department of Pharmacology
and Chemical Biology at University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, under the mentorship of Drs. Adam Straub
and Patrick Pagano. This project focuses on ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death initiated by
intracellular iron (Fe2+) accumulation and elevated hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels, which leads to
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) peroxidation and cell death. Emerging evidence supports the concept that
ferroptosis contributes to endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction and the development of several cardiovascular
diseases. However, the mechanisms modulating ferroptosis in ECs are not fully elucidated. The Straub lab
focuses on understanding the physiological and pathophysiological roles of cytochrome b5 reductase (CYB5R
1-5) enzymes in the cardiovascular system, which are proteins that govern redox balance. We recently
conducted a large-scale genomic screen comparing differences gene profiles from all five CYB5R enzymes
knocked down in primary human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Pathway analysis revealed that loss of
CYB5R1 increased ferroptosis-related genes. Preliminary studies demonstrates that CYB5R1 localizes to the
outer mitochondrial membrane and functions to mitigate the accumulation of ROS and lipid peroxides, ultimately
preventing ferroptosis. Based on our preliminary data we hypothesize than CYB5R1 protects endothelial cells
from ferroptotic cell death by mitigating membrane lipid peroxidation. We will test this hypothesis using two
specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the mechanism by which endothelial CYB5R1 modulates ferroptosis and
Aim 2 will determine whether loss of endothelial cell expressed CYB5R1 impacts blood vessel function. These
studies will help define a potential new role of CYB5R1 in endothelial cell function, with particular focus on
ferroptosis. Importantly, this project, coupled with didactic coursework, mentored training, and a customized
career development plan within an exceptional training environment at the University of Pittsburgh, will ultimately
provide the necessary skill sets needed to help foster the applicant’s long-term goal of a career in biomedical
research."
10932423,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this small business innovation research grant is to commercialize a cost-effective and contrast-free
intraoperative ureter detection system, which integrates into a laparoscopic vessel sealing device to identify
ureters in real-time and prevent iatrogenic injuries. 70% of iatrogenic ureteral injuries are detected
postoperatively, up to 30 days after hospital discharge. These injuries can cause ureteral obstruction, fistula(e)
and eventually renal failure when not repaired immediately, and cost hospitals an average of $30,000 per
patient with an added hospitalization time of 4 days. Additionally, for women with pelvic inflammatory conditions
or endometriosis, gynecologic surgery is further complicated due to lack of critical structure visualization.
Currently, the only available technologies that assist in ureter injury detection, including cystoscopy and lighted
stents, are costly and/or time-consuming and have led to additional complications such as reflux anuria and
urinary tract infections. The Briteseed system would be the first unobtrusive, easy to use and cost-effective
alternative with the potential to decrease the incidence of ureteral complications during pelvic surgery. In this
CRP project, Briteseed will finalize steps to prepare its hyperspectral imaging based rapid ureter detection
(HSI-RUD) laparoscopic vessel sealer for commercialization. The HSI-RUD uses transmission based optics to
non-invasively detect the ureters in real-time without any contrast agent. Preventing ureteral injury through
real-time detection will lead to better outcomes for patients and lessen the financial burden on the healthcare
system. In Phase I of the SBIR, the technology was optimized and validated to provide: (a) real-time,
automated ureter detection and (b) the ability to differentiate between the ureter and surrounding tissues. In
Phase II, the RUD system was integrated into a laparoscopic grasper and used in pre-clinical studies to
receive clinician feedback on the user interface. Since the end of Phase II, the company has successfully,
independently integrated an optical subsystem into a vessel sealer, which has created significant interest from
strategics to integrate our technology into their tools through co-development. Additionally, the company has
engaged with the FDA to understand the regulatory pathway of the HSI-RUD device. The technology must
undergo late stage activities to prepare for a de novo FDA submission and a high-cost manufacturing step
before it can be commercialized by either a strategic partner or Briteseed independently and made available in
operating rooms for gynecological procedures, where the ureter is at risk with no proven detection method
currently available to prevent injury."

 Cancer drug resistance is the last frontier in extending patient overall survival, especially in the deadly
brain tumor – glioblastoma (GBM). GBM currently has one standard of care chemotherapeutic agent –
temozolomide (TMZ) – which extends median overall survival to ~14-16 months. However, TMZ resistance is
rapid and uniformly fatal. Yet, because there are some long-term responders (~5% at 5 years), almost all newly
diagnosed GBMs will receive TMZ, making TMZ-resistance a major clinical unmet need, and the focus of my
previous, current, and future work. The central goal of my current work is to better understand the distinct
changes in the metabolic states between TMZ-Sensitive (TMZ-S) and -Resistant (TMZ-R) disease, allowing for
the discovery of therapeutically targetable vulnerabilities. To this end, I have found that TMZ-R cells have a
greater dependence on cystine import, increase of intracellular iron, and a maintained oxidative state that primes
these TMZ-R models for cyst(e)ine depletion-induced ferroptosis with a known neuroprotective agent – ebselen.
I further show that this form of ferroptosis – or iron-dependent cell death – could be induced by the selenium in
ebselen or TMZ-Selenium but not a TMZ-Sulfur analog in TMZ-R cells, which will no longer have a response to
TMZ alone. Therefore, the objective of this project is to meticulously characterize this cyst(e)ine depletion-
induced ferroptosis phenotype in TMZ-R models where it will both help in our understanding of TMZ-R GBM and
develop a framework where small molecule selenium-containing compounds could be of use in other diseases.
To accomplish this goal, I will take full advantage of my excellent mentoring/advisory committee as well as the
exceptional resources and training environment available to me at Northwestern University. The expected
outcomes of this project include a thorough understanding of the metabolic landscape and changes between
both TMZ-S and -R models, as well as shifts post cyst(e)ine depletion-induced ferroptosis (Aim 1). A
characterization and validation of the protein players that are necessary to mediate cyst(e)ine depletion-induced
ferroptosis in TMZ-R models, as well as how the increased oxidative state in TMZ-R may affect enzymatic active
site status that would not be discovered via sequencing methods but is essential for protein activity (Aim 2).
Finally, the mechanistic knowledge gained from a meticulous understanding of both the metabolic readouts and
proteomic players will allow for a smarter animal model design to answer and/or confirm the findings in Aim 1 &
2 (Aim 3). As I already have a strong background in RNA biology/splicing and DNA damage/structure in TMZ-R
disease, this proposal will strengthen my knowledge in the metabolic differences and learn proteomic and
metabolic techniques. In this way, I will have a well-rounded understanding of TMZ-R disease which will help me
to design smarter and more complete studies in the future when I run my own independent lab."
10812226,"Project Summary
Alcohol (ethanol) dependence and relapse in abstinent alcoholics are major health problems throughout the
world and neurochemical pathways that modulate these disorders are currently under investigation. However,
the neurobiology underlying binge drinking, a dangerous pattern of behavior that proceeds and contributes to
dependence, has received far less attention. Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify the neurocircuitry in
the brain that modulates binge drinking as such knowledge will provide insight into the initial stages of alcohol
use disorders (AUDs) and will shed new light on avenues for treating early-stage AUDs prior to the development
of dependence. During the last funding period of this grant, our laboratory has provided converging evidence
that corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) receptor signaling, via neurocircuitry providing cross-talk between brain
regions that integrate emotions/stress responses with those that motivate reward-seeking behaviors, modulates
binge-like ethanol drinking in mice. Furthermore, preliminary data described in this grant provide converging
evidence that of a novel circuit linking stress and reward systems modulates binge-like ethanol intake in a sex-
dependent manner, a highly significant discovery given our very limited understanding of the mechanisms that
drive sex differences in ethanol intake and AUDs. A critical player in integrating reward-directed behaviors is the
lateral hypothalamus (LH), and we provide preliminary evidence that blocking CRF type-1 receptors (CRF1R) in
the LH, as well as chemogenetic silencing of a CRF+ pathway from the central amygdala (CeA) to the LH, reduce
binge-like ethanol intake in male, but not female mice. The guiding hypothesis for the current grant is that CRF
receptor signaling in the LH modulates binge-like ethanol drinking, which involves the CRF+ CeA → LH pathway,
and that a history of binge-like ethanol drinking will promote plasticity within this CRF circuit linking stress and
reward systems, all in a sex-dependent manner. We will use powerful and innovative chemogenetic, transgenic,
electrophysiological, and histological approaches to test the hypothesis that LH-infusion of CRF1R antagonist
and CRF type-2 receptor (CRF2R) agonist, and knockdown of CRF1R in the LH, will protect against binge-like
ethanol drinking (Aim 1), chemogenetic inactivation or activation of CRF+ CeA neurons that project to the LH will
blunt or increase binge-like ethanol intake, respectively (Aim 2), and a history of repeated binge-like drinking
episodes will be associated with changes in CRF and CRF receptor levels and signaling in the CeA → LH
neurocircuitry. Because our preliminary data provided converging evidence that CRF signaling in this pathway
modulates binge-like ethanol drinking primarily in male mice, each aim is sufficiently powered to characterize
sex differences. The aims of this grant will address a critical gap in the literature on the role of CRF in bridging
functional communication between brain regions integrating stress/emotion with those the modulate reward-
seeking, provide novel insight into mechanisms that guide sex differences in binge-like ethanol intake, and will
shed new light on avenues for treating early-stage AUDs prior to the development of dependence."
10811827,"This is a proposal for a five year research career development program focused on the study of human antibodies
binding to neuronal cell surface proteins in autoimmune encephalitis. The goal is to gain understanding of the
pathophysiology of autoimmune encephalitis and identify novel targets for therapy in neurological disease. The
principal investigator, David R. Benavides, M.D., Ph.D., is an Assistant Professor of Neurology at University of
Maryland School of Medicine. My long term career goal is to become an independent investigator in translational
research focused on immune regulation of neural function in neurological disease. To accomplish this goal, I
propose a research project and training plan in proteomics, advanced live cell microscopy, and in vivo miniscope
technology, which is integral to addressing the central research question posed here. The research project builds
on my previous research in signal transduction and molecular neuroscience and clinical experience in
neuroimmunology and integrates innovative approaches in areas of expertise represented by my mentor team
at University of Maryland School of Medicine. I propose a comprehensive development plan, combining didactic
instruction overseen by my mentors, formal coursework, applied training experiences with individual advisors,
and participation in seminars and workshops. The proposed project and development plan will position me with
a unique skillset that will enable me to transition to independence as a physician-scientist in translational
neuroscience research.
Encephalitis is a brain disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Anti-NMDA receptor (NMDAR)
encephalitis is the most common form of autoimmune encephalitis and accounts for nearly 4% of all cases of
encephalitis. Excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity in the central nervous system are governed, in part,
by a class of glutamate neurotransmitter receptors known as NMDARs. NMDAR dysfunction can cause
psychosis, impaired memory, agitation, movement disorders, seizures, and coma and may result from many
conditions, such as drug use, genetic predisposition, and antibody targeting (e.g., anti-NMDAR encephalitis).
The effects of NMDAR antibodies on brain function in autoimmune encephalitis remain incompletely defined. My
preliminary data show that NMDAR antibodies alter neuronal signaling and neuronal activity in primary rodent
dissociated neuron cultures. How exactly NMDAR antibodies do this in anti-NMDAR encephalitis is a question
that this proposal begins to address. Specifically, the aims of the proposal are: 1) define the effects of NMDAR
antibodies on glutamate receptor signaling pathways, 2) determine the effects of NMDAR antibodies on neuronal
calcium mobilization, and 3) determine the effect of NMDAR antibodies on hippocampal neuronal circuits in vivo.
Our long term goal of this work is to elucidate the effects of human NMDAR antibodies in autoimmune
encephalitis to advance novel therapeutics for neurological disease."
10791096,"Imbalances in the gut microbiome have been documented in patients with Systemic Lupus erythematosus
(SLE), an archetypic systemic autoimmune disease that is associated with great morbidity and premature
death, especially in the ~40% with Lupus Nephritis (LN). While studies of lupus-prone mice have suggested
potential microbiome-related pathogenic pathways, little is known about the mechanisms by which gut
community alterations affect lupus pathogenesis. Our recent longitudinal studies identified patients with flares
of LN, concurrent with great intestinal expansions (or blooms) of a candidate gut pathobiont species. In murine
systems, pathobiont blooms induced high-level gut permeability, microbial translocation and inflammatory
responses. To perform unbiased surveys of possible effects on immune activation, we generated blood bulk
RNA-seq libraries from groups of patients at time of high disease activity, and compared to matched controls.
We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team to now test a novel data-driven mechanistic hypothesis: that
intestinal blooms of this pathobiont contribute to lupus flares through systemic release of microbial factors
causing platelet activation and thromboinflammation, pathways first documented in patients with sepsis.
In Aim 1, we will focus on human systems, and in feasibility studies we will analyze RNA-seq libraries from
individual patients over time, to determine whether this platelet activation profile fluctuates with disease activity,
or if it represents a persistent state. We will also interrogate public data sets to investigate whether these
pathways are common in other SLE cohorts. Established in vitro assay systems will characterize phenotypic
and functional changes in platelets isolated from patients representative of bloom and non bloom active LN
groups, non-renal SLE patients and healthy controls. Using naïve human cells, and stimulation with killed
candidate pathobiont, co-cultured with strains isolated from SLE patients or healthy individuals, or pathobiont-
derived immune active components, we will directly test for in vitro capacity to directly activate human
platelets, implicated in the pathogenesis of LN.
In Aim 2, we will assess the feasibility of using murine models, by in vitro and in vivo testing, to assess
whether components of the gut microbiome trigger these postulated immune pathways implicated in Lupus
pathogenesis. Our mechanistic studies will utilize the same set of stimulants and microbiome factors used in
Aim 1 in established murine models emulating the human system.

10809367,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Recent data has shown that individual taste modalities may not be completely segregated with specific
cell types in the taste bud which has begun to question the strict roles previously attributed to the various subsets
of cells within the mammalian taste bud. Using fatty acid taste as a model, where both Type II and Type III cells
have been implicated in in fatty acid signaling, we will attempt to generate the data necessary in this exploratory
research program to be able to tackle larger questions surrounding the cell type function within the taste bud. To
accomplish this, however, requires we have a thorough understanding of the cellular and molecular
underpinnings of fatty acid transduction in Type II and III cells. Moreover, given the emerging data that shows
pronounced sex differences in fatty acid taste signaling and its regulation, this project includes a careful analysis
of signaling in males and females (at various stages) using a cell-based approach. Specifically, we will test the
hypothesis that Type II and Type III cells both respond to fatty acids but do so via different transduction pathways
that may ultimately reflect a different role in these cell types.
 Our goal is to elucidate the transduction pathways for two classes of fatty acids in the mammalian taste
system in Type II and Type III cells and identify any potential sex differences in these pathways. The two-year
R21 mechanisms is ideally suited to accomplish these important goals in a timely fashion. Once armed with
these data on the mechanics of signaling for long chain unsaturated fatty acids (lcUFAs) and medium chain
saturated fatty acids (mcSFAs) in Type II and III from males and females, it will be possible to directly assess
the role of these cell types in signal processing within the taste bud. For example, our working view on the
function of these cell types is that Type II cells are involved most directly in the initial signal transduction for fatty
acids while Type III cells perform a more modulatory role in response to changes associated with dietary
experience and/or disease (obesity; diabetes). To test this will require identification of important targets within
these pathways so that experiments like cell type specific manipulation of gene expression can tease apart the
functional differences. To generate the necessary information, we will use patch clamp recording and functional
calcium imaging in association with pharmacological interventions and ion substitution to elucidate the
transduction pathway for these two classes of fatty acids in genetically identified Type II and Type III cells. To
address the sex specificity within these pathways, we will compare males, females in proestrus, females in estrus,
and ovariectomized (OVX) females with and without hormone replacement to address two specific aims:
 • To elucidate long chain unsaturated fatty acid transduction in Type II and Type III cells (Aim 1)
 • To explore the signaling elements in GPR84 transduction pathway in taste cells (Aim 2)
 This will provide the necessary background data to allow more detailed exploration of the role of fat taste
in the peripheral gustatory system and its regulation by the endocrine system due to effects of diet and disease."
10810666,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PROJECT 1
The purpose of PROJECT 1 is to use nonhuman primates to examine prefrontal local circuit and distributed
network impairments associated with state representation dysfunctions of relevance to individuals with
psychosis. PROJECT 1 will relate synaptically mediated functional interactions between neurons in prefrontal
networks to computations that support state representation processes. In Aim 1, we will quantify functional
neural interactions by measuring temporal correlations in the timing of action potentials (‘spikes’) imposed by
synaptic interactions between the neurons. In Aim 2, we will disrupt those interactions by pharmacologically
blocking NMDA receptors (NMDAR), which induces a period of transient cognitive impairment during which
monkeys commit similar patterns of behavioral errors during the DPX decision-making task as do people with
schizophrenia. We will record neural activity in prefrontal cortex and anatomically connected brain areas
(posterior parietal cortex and the dorsal striatum) concurrently during the period of cognitive impairment, while
monkeys perform the DPX and Bandit tasks, which allow us to index state estimation, state learning, and state
stability processes. We will discover how reducing NMDAR synaptic transmission alters functional interactions
between neurons in prefrontal networks, leading to computational failures in state representation processes.
To provide a bridge to neural signals that we can record in humans, we will record neural signals that reflect
brain activity at the microscale (single neuron action potentials), mesoscale (local field potentials within a
cortical area) and macroscale (local field potentials and EEG across cortical areas) from prefrontal cortex and
connected structures simultaneously. We will use causal discovery analysis to identify the parameters that can
be found with more limited neurophysiological techniques available in humans (for PROJECTS 3 and 4). As
PROJECT 4 identifies specific cognitive training regimens that improve state estimation and state stability in
individuals with early psychosis, PROJECT 1 will back-translate these paradigms to monkeys to identify
training-induced changes in attractor network parameters at the neurophysiological (micro-, meso- and macro-
circuit) levels."
10810671,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PROJECT 2
The purpose of PROJECT 2 is to use mice as an experimental system to investigate cellular and synaptic
neurophysiology that captures core features of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) microcircuit dysfunction
that may be related to information processing failures in psychosis. The organizing premise of our Center is
that psychosis involves dysfunctional state representation processes, which we will study across species at
the behavioral level using the Dot Pattern Expectancy (DPX) task and the Bandit probabilistic reversal
learning task. Guided by published neurophysiology findings in the prefrontal cortex of nonhuman primates
after systemic NMDA receptor blockade, we propose to measure the coordinated activity of neuronal
ensembles in the medial prefrontal cortex of mice performing these two tasks.
In Aim 1, we will use genetic manipulations to selectively delete NMDA receptors from the medial
prefrontal cortex, while also testing the same pharmacological manipulation of NMDA receptors used in
PROJECT 1. In Aim 2, we will study mouse lines carrying the three most common genetic variants
associated with psychosis with genome-wide significance. Behavior and neurophysiology data will be
passed to the COMPUTATIONAL CORE, to conduct the same causal discovery analyses and
computational modeling used across all PROJECTS. In Aim 3, we will probe synaptic function in the
medial prefrontal cortex of each mutant mouse line, to determine whether differences in the synaptic
microcircuit (i.e., local connections between excitatory and inhibitory neurons) are related to behavioral and
disease phenotypes. Data from the synaptic level will be used to evaluate and inform the Neurophysiology-
Level attractor network model, which includes synaptic weights as key parameters. Our central hypothesis
is that mutant mice will exhibit synaptic dysfunction and related changes in mPFC neurophysiology, which
we expect to have a negative impact on various state representation processes. We expect to observe
heterogeneous impairments across different genetic manipulations, mirroring the heterogeneity present in
patient populations (PROJECTS 3 & 4), and providing fodder for computational modeling and causal
discovery analyses. Within our Center, these experiments provide a unique opportunity for precise
measurement and manipulation of both disease-related dysfunction and treatment-related plasticity in the
medial prefrontal cortex microcircuit, while translating results across species through computational
analyses."
10810673,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PROJECT 3
The purpose of PROJECT 3 is to determine how failures in information processing that supports state
representation in neural circuits relate to clinical heterogeneity in early psychosis. To this end, we will: (a)
Recruit people with early psychosis (N=125) and demographically similar healthy controls (N=125) aged 16-30
years; (b) Determine test-retest reliability of the DPX and Bandit tasks as assessments of state representation
processes; (c) Characterize behavioral performance and neurophysiology at baseline using the DPX and
Bandit tasks during simultaneous EEG-fMRI; (d) Follow patients for 6 months while they receive usual care, to
delineate their clinical trajectories; (e) Repeat the behavioral and EEG-fMRI assessments after six months
(N=100 retained per group). The data we acquire will allow us to examine the baseline relationships between
clinical and experimental measures, and also to investigate how changes in clinical and experimental
measures are related over a 6-month time period during a critical phase of illness.
The overall goal of PROJECT 3 is to permit neural macro-circuit links in humans to the behavioral and
neurophysiology experiments in monkeys and mice (PROJECTS 1 & 2). This will allow us to examine how
state representation dysfunctions observed in early psychosis -- along with EEG and fMRI-derived
neurophysiologic indices of activity timing, excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance, and noise -- relate to clinical
heterogeneity at baseline, and to heterogeneity in 6-month clinical trajectories. In Aim 1, we compute the retest
reliability of state representation measures. In Aim 2, we characterize and compare the features of behavior,
EEG and fMRI in early psychosis and healthy controls during state representation processes. In Aim 3,we re-
assess performance on the DPX and Bandit tasks during simultaneous EEG-FMRI, in order to characterize the
course of state representation dysfunctions in early psychosis during the critical first 6 months of
treatment. We will determine the extent to which changes in computational parameters derived from the
COMPUTATIONAL CORE, and neurophysiologic measures related to activity timing, E-I balance, and noise
(see TRANSLATIONAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY CORE), map to distinct trajectories in quality of life using
causal discovery analyses. We will also test whether trajectories can be predicted from baseline features.
Additionally, our healthy control data set will permit us to explore normal patterns of stability vs. change as
observed over 6 months in adolescents and young adults."
10810675,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PROJECT 4
The purpose of PROJECT 4 is to investigate computationally-informed precision treatments to improve two
forms of state representation dysfunction in early psychosis: 1) State estimation processes at the perceptual
input level, which we will target through auditory discrimination training; 2) State representation stability of
auditory information, which we will target through auditory working memory training. Participants will be drawn
from PROJECT 3, where they will have been assessed with behavioral and EEG-fMRI measures at baseline
and after 6 months of usual care, so that their initial characteristics and clinical trajectory will be
known. Participants will be stratified on an EEG index of state estimation processes (fronto-parietal theta
power at DPX encoding), which we posit to be present in ~60% of subjects, and randomly assigned to one of
the two training strategies. Our goal is not to perform a treatment efficacy study comparing these two
interventions. Rather, we seek to use predictions derived from attractor network models to test the effects of
neuroplasticity-based precision treatments targeting two distinct information processing pathologies in early
psychosis, with the ultimate goal of improving state representation processes and cognition.
In Aim 1, we will investigate parameter changes in the fit attractor network models in each subject group, fit to
DPX and Bandit Task behavioral data immediately after training and 3 months later, and we will assess
whether parameter changes reflect restorative or compensatory modifications. We will also test the hypothesis
that state representation processes and cognitive performance show greater improvement in subjects who
received training tailored to their state estimation parameter. In Aim 2, we will examine how specific
parameter changes in attractor network models relate to neurophysiological changes in measures indexing
activity timing, excitatory-inhibitory balance, and system noise, in order to identify which changes are the most
predictive of improved cognition. Causal discovery analyses will be employed to identify causal relationships
among computational parameters, behavioral data, neurophysiologic indices, treatment assignment, and one-
year clinical trajectories."

The purpose of the Translational Neurophysiology Core is to link the individual Projects by facilitating cross-
species, cross-method behavioral and neural data collection and analysis. Our Center relies on standardized
EEG/fMRI acquisition and processing, as well as consistent DPX and Bandit task data collection with human
control subjects and participants with early psychosis (PROJECTS 3 and 4). In addition, ensemble
recordings and local field potential data, along with DPX and Bandit task behavioral data, will be collected in
nonhuman primates (PROJECT 1) and mice (PROJECT 2). The cross-modal aspect of neural recordings
and behavioral data acquisition presents unique challenges, which will be addressed through three Service
Aims.
Service Aim 1: Support for behavioral data acquisition. Our Center will collect trial-by-trial data in
humans from identical experimental behavioral paradigms (the DPX and Bandit tasks) acquired across both
clinical and normative human samples, studied in multiple settings (e.g. PROJECTS 3 & 4). It is important
that these paradigms be developed to be administered in a highly reliable manner using portable digital
methods, and that the data collected from these paradigms be stored, processed, integrated, and visualized
in a secure, reliable, and accessible manner so that findings can be compared across Projects.
Service Aim 2: Standardized collection, preprocessing, and analysis of simultaneously acquired EEG
and fMRI data in humans. Our goal is to ensure that these data are collected, preprocessed, and analyzed
in an identical manner across PROJECTS 3 and 4, with a focus on acquiring measures that can be used by
the COMPUTATIONAL CORE to assess activity timing, excitatory-inhibitory balance, and system noise.
Service Aim 3: Cross-species neuroanatomical translation. We will facilitate translation of neural circuits
across species by using connectivity data (combination of diffusion MRI and tract- tracing) to identify
homologies across nonhuman primates (PROJECT 1), mice (PROJECT 2), and humans (PROJECTS 3 & 4)."
10810678,"PROJECT SUMMARY: COMPUTATIONAL CORE
The purpose of the COMPUTATIONAL CORE is to provide services for infrastructure and conceptual support
to integrate the four Projects that form our Center. To do this, the Core will ensure that the trial-by-trial
behavioral data collected from the four Projects (from the computationally informative DPX and Bandit tasks)
are analyzed in a uniform and compatible manner, so that findings across Projects can be compared and
modeled. It will also supply overall statistical support to ensure that statistical analyses are done appropriately.
The Core consists of a Service Aim and a Modeling Aim. In the Service Aim, we propose to apply causal
discovery analyses, a recently developed toolkit of mathematical algorithms that can infer explanatory
relationships between co-occurring data parameters. Causal discovery analyses serve as a powerful
inferential toolbox that can be applied to all of the PROJECTS independently, facilitating the generation of new
hypotheses within and across PROJECTS. In the Modeling Aim, the Core will provide conceptual and
modeling support for the theoretical underpinning of state representation dysfunctions relevant to psychosis.
As noted in the OVERALL RESEARCH STRATEGY, we take a central computational perspective to translate
across species and methodologies, using theoretical constructs to bridge the gap between neural dysfunction
and observable manifestations of that dysfunction. To this end, the Core will integrate two existing models: an
Algorithmic-Level Model that translates attractor dynamics to behavior, and a Neurophysiology-Level Model
that translates neuronal properties to attractor dynamics. Our goal is to examine how neuronal-scale effects,
such as those seen in the non-human animal projects (PROJECTS 1 & 2) translate into observable behavioral
and neurophysiological effects in healthy and clinical populations, such as those seen in the human projects
(PROJECTS 3 & 4), by merging these two models into an integrated model crossing levels, that can provide
mechanistic explanatory power for how neurophysiological effects produce attractor dynamics that lead to
behavioral outcomes."
10808383,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Similar to the mature immune system in adults, the developing immune system in children must protect the host
from infections and cancer while preventing autoimmunity. Immune system function undergoes changes during
early organism development. Therefore, in order to develop appropriate immune based therapies for children
requires understanding of the unique immune system features during this critical period. There is a fundamental
knowledge gap in understanding the cellular mechanisms governing changes in immune system function during
early life development. CD8+ T cells are critical for protection from cancer and infections and demonstrate distinct
functional properties dependent upon the developmental status of the organism. Changes in cellular activity are
dependent upon the support of discrete metabolic pathways (such as pyruvate) to provide energy, reducing
equivalents, and biosynthetic building blocks bolstering the diverse array of cellular functions. As such,
understanding how metabolic pathway usage changes over the course of early life development, within CD8+ T
cells, provides a platform for mechanistically understanding T cell development. Cellular metabolism provides
an investigatory approach to mechanistically probe through identifying the activity of individual metabolic
pathways and their functional consequences. This allows for in situ control of immune system function via
manipulation of metabolic inhibitors or donors.
The impact of T cell development on these metabolic competitions in the context of pediatric cancer is unknown.
Thus, understanding T cell metabolic requirements in the TME is an opportunity to enhance anti-tumor immunity
and extend the benefits of immunotherapy in children with cancer. This proposal will use complementary
metabolomic, transcriptomic, and cellular immunology approaches to investigate metabolic pathway activity
during CD8+ T cell development and the impact on protection from the childhood cancer neuroblastoma. Using
a validated immune competent preclinical model of neuroblastoma, we will mechanistically investigate the
immune biology of this cancer using cellular metabolism. Our preliminary findings demonstrate T cells from young
mice have increased proliferation and acquisition of effector function in response to pyruvate supplementation.
Metabolically we found neonatal T cells preferentially converted pyruvate to alanine indicating a distinct
developmentally regulated metabolic cellular fate. Understanding how developmental processes, like this
“rewiring” of immune cell metabolism, disproportionately impacts T cell protection from cancer in young animals
is critical to begin tailoring immune therapies to children. If successful aims from this proposal will determine how
1) development controls metabolic support of immune cell function, 2) organism development impacts CD8+ cell
metabolic activity, and 3) metabolic regulation of anti-tumor immunity during development. While this proposal
focuses on neuroblastoma, it will serve as a foundation to broadly support pediatric cancer immunotherapy
discovery in other types of childhood cancers."
10930129,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are the major excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the
brain and changes in AMPAR number at synapses underlie learning and memory as well as human disease. A
detailed understanding of how AMPARs are organized at synapses is critical to understand how synaptic
strength is regulated and for the development of therapeutics to correct circuit imbalances in human disease.
 The long-term goal of this proposal is to use Cryo-EM to understand how the structural basis of AMPAR
N-terminal domain interactions (NTDs) drive functional outcomes such as increased AMPAR accumulation and
synaptic strength. The rationale for this approach is twofold 1) it will help resolve long-standing questions about
the regulation of key neurotransmitter receptors; and 2) a detailed structural model of AMPARs participating in
key regulatory complexes will guide future therapeutic approaches that seek to alter the strength of excitatory
input onto neurons implicated in psychiatric illnesses like schizophrenia. The adhesion protein NPTX2 binds to
AMPARs, clusters AMPARs at synapses, and is required for homeostatic scaling of interneuron-specific GluA4-
containing AMPARs. Therefore, NPTX2-dependent GluA4 scaling is an ideal model for testing the hypothesis
that direct extracellular interactions with AMPARs control synaptic strength. This approach is innovative because
models of AMPAR plasticity have never been observed in structural detail. This research is significant because
it will yield new insights into how AMPAR interactions drive plasticity and how this can be exploited for therapeutic
benefit in the future. An example of such an approach would be a structure-guided therapeutic strategy for
clustering GluA4 on the surface of Parvalbumin-expressing interneurons (PVINs), which exhibit lowered
excitatory drive in models of schizophrenia.
 The long-term goal of this project will be achieved with the following two specific aims: 1) Determine the
structure of the NPTX2/GluA4 complex via single particle Cryo-EM. and 2) Test whether NPTX2 drives
GluA4 PVIN scaling through a direct interaction. For the first aim we will employ single-particle Cryo-EM to
solve the structure of the activity-regulated synaptic adhesion molecule NPTX2 in complex with the interneuron-
specific GluA4 AMPARs. For the second aim, we will employ transgenic mouse models, biochemistry, neuron
culture, confocal light microscopy, and electrophysiology to test the hypothesis that direct binding of NPTX2 to
the NTD of GluA4 drives homeostatic scaling in disease-associated PVINs.
 The applicant has proposed this work in part to further their long-term goal of establishing an independent
research career connecting the structure of synaptic proteins to their synaptic function. The candidate will
undertake extensive training in Cryo-EM and biophysics which will be facilitated by an expert mentoring team
composed of an AMPAR Cryo-EM expert, an AMPAR plasticity expert, and an expert in NPTX2, all of whom will
mentor the applicant through the transition to a tenure track academic position."

For the immense undertaking by many malaria-endemic nations to eliminate malaria, interruption of malaria
transmission has been recognized as one of the greatest challenges, which requires integrated approaches.
Plasmodium vivax, the most geographically widespread human malaria, is more resilient to conventional
malaria control measures due to its intrinsic biology such as hypnozoite formation responsible for relapses and
earlier gametocyte development enabling transmission before manifestation of symptoms. Transmission-
blocking vaccines (TBVs) are a promising strategy especially suited for the task of elimination of vivax malaria.
However, the progress in TBV development has been very slow, whereas TBV research for P. vivax lags even
far behind that for Plasmodium falciparum. With only five parasite antigens as the top TBV candidates,
concerted efforts to identify new TBV antigens are urgently needed. In this application, we propose to use an
innovative antigen discovery pathway taking advantage of new protein expression and immunoscreening
technologies, and advancement in vaccine design and delivery platforms. We aim to 1) discover new sexual-
stage antigens by in silico prediction and immunoscreening, and evaluate their transmission reducing activities
in Plasmodium berghei; 2) evaluate a TBV combination strategy targeting both pre- and post-fertilization
antigens; and 3) assess the transmission reducing activities of new TBV candidates for P. vivax using
transgenic P. berghei and clinical P. vivax isolates. Results from these comprehensive studies will contribute to
a better understanding of sexual development in malaria parasites and identification of new sexual-stage
antigens for the TBV development pipeline."
10808787,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease with virtually no therapeutic options to
reverse its pathology. Glial cells, including microglia, play critical roles in brain homeostasis and disease
progression. GPR56 (also called ADGRG1 ), an adhesion G protein-coupled receptor (aGPCR), is one of the
critical genes that define ""true"" microglia: Gpr56 is only expressed in yolk sac-derived microglia but not in fetal
liver- and bone marrow-derived microglia-like cells, even after long-term adaptation in the CNS in vivo.
Importantly, a recent study from Mathys et al. showed that GPR56 is one of the five genes upregulated in
microglia in individuals dying with early-stage AD compared to those with no pathology or late-stage AD.
Importantly, their data was generated from participants in a community-based cohort study, the Religious Order
Study (ROS)/Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), collectively known as ROSMAP. Of those autopsied, the
mean age was 89 years. This observation raises the possibility that individuals with upregulated microglial
GPR56 survived to advanced age with mild AD pathology. To investigate the unexplored function of microglial
GPR56 in AD progression, we generated a new AD mouse model, 5xFAD;Gpr56"""""";Cx3cr1-Cre'1-(AD-cKO) and
5xFAD;Gpr56+1';Cx3cr1-Cre+1
- (AD-control). Our preliminary showed: (1) a significant reduction in the number of
microglia associated with amyloid plaques, (2) a drastic increase in plaque burden, (3) a reduction in NeuNpositive
neurons, and (4) more severe dendritic dystrophy in AD-cKO mouse brains compared to AD-controls.
Taken together, I hypothesize that microg/ial GPR56 limits AD pathological progression in both AD mouse
models and human patients. To test this hypothesis, I will address the following aims: Aim 1 is to investigate the
role of microglial GPR56 in restricting AD progression in the mouse model; Aim 2 is to determine cellular and
molecular mechanism(s) underlying microglial GPR56 function in AD pathogenesis; and Aim 3 is to characterize
GPR56 expression and GPR56-dependent cellular responses in control, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and
AD human brain tissues. In summary, the proposed research will reveal crucial information about the role of
microglial GPR56 in AD pathology. The success of this study will extend our knowledge of both glial cells and
aGPCRs, providing a novel therapeutic target for AD treatment"
10811588,"In the healthy nervous system, the development of intention and motor execution is a dynamic and highly

limb movements, relatively little is known about the central control of human locomotion. Further, failures of

dramatic consequences that induce transient or permanent deficits in motor control. A particularly palpable

10811592,"Abstract
Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a highly prevalent condition, triples the risk for cardiovascular disease.
Observational studies suggested that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy improves
cardiovascular outcomes in OSA. However, 3 recent randomized clinical trials failed to confirm those findings,
indicating that cardiovascular risk persists in OSA despite effective elimination of intermittent hypoxia (IH). Our
preliminary data suggest that CPAP may unexpectedly exacerbate the pro-inflammatory milieu in OSA, which
may contribute to the residual cardiovascular risk observed in randomized trials of CPAP therapy. Thus,
alternative therapies for OSA-related cardiovascular risk are urgently needed. Using endothelial cells (ECs)
freshly harvested from OSA patients, we identified increased deposition of the complement membrane attack
complex (MAC) on ECs, a consequence of increased internalization of the complement inhibitor CD59 from the
EC surface, as a trigger of endothelial inflammation in OSA. We showed that this process is mediated by
alterations in EC cholesterol metabolism and trafficking in response to IH and is blocked by statins. We found
that randomly allocated statin therapy protects ECs from MAC-induced inflammation compared to placebo,
including in OSA patients adherent with CPAP. In the same study, CPAP had no impact on MAC deposition.
Unlike CPAP, statins do not eliminate IH episodes in OSA. However, by lowering systemic and cellular
cholesterol levels, statins may exert endothelial protection by inhibiting complement-mediated vascular injury in
OSA, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy that may allow OSA patients to continue to benefit from CPAP-
mediated elimination of IH and fragmented sleep while reducing their cardiovascular risk. Statin use among OSA
patients has been consistently low: only 8-13% of OSA patients are prescribed statins in studies spanning the
last decade, indicating that this potentially beneficial therapy has been vastly underutilized in OSA patients. We
will use rigorous randomized, double blind, parallel group, placebo controlled study design and ECs
harvested from otherwise healthy OSA patients to assess the overall hypothesis that statins stabilize
endothelial function by improving endothelial cholesterol metabolism and trafficking regardless of the adherence
with CPAP therapy. To address this overall hypothesis, we will determine 1) whether statins reduce endothelial
inflammation and pro-thrombotic conditions in OSA, including in patients adherent to CPAP who may express
increased inflammatory markers (Aim 1), and 2) whether statins reduce endothelial inflammation and pro-
thrombotic conditions by improving endothelial cholesterol metabolism and trafficking in OSA (Aim 2). These
studies will advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular
risk in OSA that seem to persist despite effective CPAP therapy. Since a minority of OSA patients are currently
treated with statins, our study will provide the mechanistic background to justify a practical clinical trial to
determine if statin therapy improves cardiovascular outcomes in OSA."
10811597,"Background: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) commonly use glucocorticoids (GCs) despite their
toxicity and the risk of adverse symptoms when they are tapered. Such symptoms pose a major barrier to GC
tapering for many, but are minimal or well-tolerated by others. Clinicians cannot predict how a patient will
respond to GC dose reduction and rely on trial and error when tapering GCs, encouraging extended GC
exposure. Personalized medicine based on patient phenotyping is a cornerstone of RA management, yet
current GC tapering strategies remain “one size fits all”.
Significance/Impact: This application proposes a career development and research plan to characterize and
phenotype responses to GC dose reduction among Veterans with RA. This research agenda is well-aligned with
Clinical Science Research and Development priority research focus on individual treatment response and
treatment optimization. In the short-term, the results of this proposal will lead to a Merit award proposal to
test GC tapering protocols tailored to specific phenotypes, in a sequential multi-assignment randomized
clinical trial (SMART). Long-term, Dr. Wallace will expand this line of research to personalize a) GC tapering in
other conditions common among Veterans (e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, gout, etc). b)
other high-risk treatment regimens where data to guide optimization are limited (e.g. biologic drugs, opioids).
Dr. Wallace is a VHA rheumatologist and research investigator who is committed to improving treatment
outcomes for Veterans using high-risk medications Her long-term goal is to become an independent physician-
scientist focused on developing personalized sequential treatment strategies to optimize medication use in the
Veteran population.
Innovation: The proposed work will apply personalized medicine approaches to GC tapering to understand
why, and for whom, current GC tapering strategies fail. Short-term, this line of research will generate new
hypotheses surrounding etiology and management of GC taper-related symptoms in Veterans with RA, as well
as critical data on GC response phenotypes and associated effect sizes. Long-term, this work will inform other
innovative trials to guide optimization of high-risk medications across medical specialties within VHA.
Specific Aims: Focusing on Veterans with RA as a test case, this proposal aims to (1) Evaluate response to (a)
15-day and (b) 6-month GC dose reduction strategies; (2) Identify multi-dimensional phenotypes of patient
response to GC dose reduction, that can be used to develop tailored GC tapering strategies (SA2).
Training Aims: Dr. Wallace and her mentorship team have developed a program of targeted coursework,
seminars, directed readings, and mentored research that will provide her with necessary training in: a)
selecting and interpreting appropriate endpoints for measuring treatment change; b) quantitative methods
required for clinical phenotyping; c) clinical trial design and analysis, with specific training in SMART and
adaptive methodologies.
Deliverables from Aims: The proposed aims will prepare Dr. Wallace to write and submit a Merit proposal
(Year 4) that uses SMART methods to test tailored GC tapering strategies in Veterans with RA. In addition to
conference presentations and publications, she will work with an array of partners to disseminate her research
findings throughout VHA and develop strategies to implement her work and maximize impact."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States
(US), with rising incidence among low-income individuals. Due to importance of cancer stage at diagnosis to
survival, we applied small area estimation to the population-based cancer registry in urban Los Angeles
County (LAC) to identify areas of highest late stage HCC burden for intervention. These geographic late stage
HCC “hotspots” were disproportionately concentrated in areas of lowest socioeconomic status (SES). Few
strategies to promote the early detection of HCC have been studied and most are not tailored to the low SES
populations that experience the greatest disparity. The scientific objective of this proposal is to address this
need by characterizing the individual-, organizational-, and community-level determinants of the geographic
aggregation of late stage HCC in low SES communities. Specifically, we propose to use geospatial techniques
to refine our population-based late stage hotspots and perform sensitivity analyses around spatial, clinical, and
temporal inputs (Aim 1). We will analyze a multilevel dataset built from prospective survey, medical record, and
geospatial linkage of 700 incident HCC registry cases to identify the root determinants of SES disparities (Aim
2). Last, semi-structured interviews will be conducted at multiple levels (e.g., patients, providers, and
community leaders) to explore barriers to completion of the early detection pathway for HCC in low SES
populations (Aim 3). Study constructs are conceptually grounded in the National Institute on Minority Health
and Health Disparities Framework, with interviews guided by the Multi-Level Health Outcomes Framework.
Together, our rich theory-driven data will directly inform the strategic plan for a multilevel early detection pilot
intervention targeting late stage HCC hotspots in a future R34, followed by a cluster randomized controlled
intervention trial in a R01. The training objectives in this proposal will foster Dr. Zhou’s growth as a cancer
disparities researcher focused on geospatial innovation in early detection strategies to mitigate disparities and
improve outcomes among underserved populations with HCC. The four core components of Dr. Zhou’s training
plan combine advanced didactics with applied experience: (1) proficiency in spatial methodology and
geovisualization; (2) foundation in multilevel modeling and qualitative methods to support effective disparities
research; (3) introduction to multilevel intervention design and delivery; and (4) professional development in
cancer disparities. Dr. Zhou has access to an academic research environment enriched for cancer disparities
and cancer control research, a socioeconomically diverse urban population in LAC, and a strong
transdisciplinary mentorship team, comprised of primary mentor Dr. Cockburn (spatial sciences and cancer
control) and co-mentors Dr. Mack (multilevel modeling), Dr. Bastani (multilevel interventions), and Dr. Terrault
(career development). In summary, this proposal embeds detailed training goals within a practical sequence of
research aims to provide Dr. Zhou with a clear path to investigator independence."

The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the United States is 1 in 44 in children, with more than 5
million adult Americans and about 1% (more than 75 million people) of the world population having ASD. ASD is
characterized by four core symptoms, which are; impaired communication and social interaction, restrictive
interests, repetitive behaviors, and irritability. Current medications are limited and focus only on irritability, which
is just one of the four core symptoms. To relieve the severe burden of this disease, the development of novel
medications that can address the full range of ASD behaviors is an urgent unmet need. Defects in neuronal
morphogenesis, including neurite formation, spine formation and synaptogenesis, cause improper neural
connectivity, which has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as ASD, epilepsy, and mental
retardation. Recent studies have shown that many ASD animal models and human models using induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) show decreased neurite length. We have recently found that Pigment Epithelium-
Derived Factor (PEDF) plays a critical role in neuronal morphogenesis and neural activity in vivo, including
neurite formation, spine formation and calcium signaling. Preliminary data show that the treatment of primary
cortical neurons with PEDF-derived snippet, called PEDF(44-mer) (amino acid 78-121) peptide accelerates
neurite formation. Also, we found that PEDF(44-mer) could rescue social interaction defects in prenatal valproic
acid (VPA)-exposed mice. In addition, our proteomic analysis revealed the activity-dependent neuroprotective
protein (Adnp) is a potential downstream effector of PEDF signaling pathway. ADNP mutations in humans are
among the most common single-gene causes of ASD and result in ADNP syndrome. We found that PEDF(44-
mer) could rescue social interaction defects and repetitive behavior seen in the Adnp+/- mice. Therefore, in Aim
1, we will investigate whether treatment of the Adnp+/- mice with PEDF peptides can ameliorate the defects in
neuronal morphogenesis, including neurite formation and spine formation. In Aim 2, we will test whether PEDF
peptides can ameliorate the defects in synapse formation and neural connectivity seen in the Adnp+/- mice. Since
our proposal will test a potential new medication target for the defects in early developmental stages seen in
children with ADNP syndrome and ASD, our study makes a major contribution to a field that would benefit millions
of people in the United States. We will scrutinize the possibility of a novel drug useful for treating the impairment
of neuromorphogenesis and neural connectivity during early development, which are incurable with existing
medications. Thus, the successful completion of the research will lead to the improvement of the quality of life of
children and adults with ASD and neurodevelopmental disorders."

biology. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) RAISE Program will 1) recruit and engage
undergraduate students who demonstrate ambition and determination to pursue an oral biology-related career;
2) provide the knowledge and skills that will prepare students for advanced degree admission and a biomedical
career in oral biology, and 3) enhance the research workforce by nurturing the academic and professional growth
of students that represent all aspects of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and life experiences. The 10-
week program will recruit nine students per year. Special consideration will be given to students from
economically and/or socially disadvantaged backgrounds, including underrepresented minority applicants, first-
generation students, and students from non-research-intensive South Carolina higher education institutions.
Students will conduct a biomedical hypothesis-driven project under the guidance of a faculty mentor whose
research program is aligned with the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) scientific
priorities. The program will leverage the expertise of MUSC faculty, many of whom are established mentors on
our NIDCR T32 Training in Craniofacial and Oral Health Research (T-COHR) grant. Dr. Yilmaz, DDS, PhD
and Dr. Westwater, PhD with their complementary backgrounds in academic mentoring bring forth a successfully
integrated undergraduate oral biology program encompassing basic science, clinical knowledge, and
team-based leadership. In addition to hands-on research training in oral biology, students will receive
responsible conduct of research training, professional development, and networking opportunities. Activities will
include an authentic research experience; a specialized lecture series; formal and informal discussions on the
core principles of rigor and reproducibility; and a journal club focused on the connection between oral health and
systemic conditions. Trainees will gain an appreciation for the translational relevance of their studies through
interprofessional experiences in a clinical setting. The program will culminate with formal presentation at the
MUSC Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium, a one-day conference in which students present their
research to their peers, primary mentors, and research team advisors. Students will be encouraged to build both
social and academic networks. Each student will be paired via the Big Sister/Brother Program with a student,
who will provide professional and social support while on the MUSC campus. After graduating from the RAISE
Program, students will be enrolled in the RAISE Alumni Network. Inclusion in this network will facilitate post-
program career planning and will increase the likelihood that students will select long-term careers in oral biology-
related fields. In turn, we expect our alumni to become part of the research workforce who will focus on improving
oral health and well-being for all individuals across the lifespan."

7T MRI systems are installed worldwide more and more rapidly and are currently being evaluated in
clinics for a number of conditions such as detection of small focal cortical dysplasia, brain tumors and
multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. However, the signal-to-noise and resolution advantage of 7T MRI is
counterbalanced by increased heterogeneity of the static B0 and transmit B1+ fields that degrade
image quality, which in turn slows clinical translation for example for patients with temporal lobe
epilepsy or MS lesions in the lower part of the brain/cerebellum. Parallel transmission (pTx) is a
popular solution to the problem of inhomogeneous B1+ but is costly (~$100k per transmit channel x 8
or 16 channels) and leads to complex specific absorption rate (SAR) management requiring lengthy
electromagnetic simulations that need to be validated. B0 field inhomogeneities close to the sinuses
and ear canals can be greatly reduced using multi-channel (MC) shim arrays that place dozens of
small loops close to the head and can be rapidly be switched on/off, thus allowing dynamic (slice-by-
slice) shimming which outperforms global brain shimming with conventional spherical harmonics shim
coils. Despite the potential of pTx and MC shim arrays, those state-of-the-art technologies are not
being quickly translated to the clinics because of the cost and complexity of combining and operating
them. In fact, most 7T systems currently operate in single channel mode with conventional spherical
harmonics shim coils, and therefore do not address head-on the dual problems of B0 and B1+ field
inhomogeneities, thus likely yielding sub-optimal image quality that may affect the perceived clinical
value of 7T MRI.
 We propose a bioengineering research program leveraging the field control capability of
MC shim arrays to homogenize the flip-angle at 7T, thus yielding an integrated solution for B0
and flip-angle shimming that bypasses the need for pTx. We develop pulse design strategies that
use the degrees-of-freedom of MC shim arrays for flip-angle control while minimizing power
requirements and SAR. This includes general spokes and kT-point pulses where the gradient blips
are replaced by MC shim array blips with more general spatial distributions, as well as optimal control
of RF, gradient and MC shim current waveforms based on a direct optimization of Bloch dynamics.
We use those approaches to design “universal” pulses that can be played quickly without preparation.
We simulate and build an MC shim array integrated with the RF coil (“AC/DC” design) that is
optimized for simultaneous B0 and flip-angle shimming performance, which we evaluate in healthy
subjects and MS patients."
10932365,"Personalized cancer treatment is becoming a reality. The real-world adoption of broad genomic profiling (BGP)
has enabled the simultaneous testing of hundreds of potentially targetable genetic alterations in patients with
cancer. Professional societies have endorsed BGP in clinical practice for several cancer types, including
advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC). Yet evidence regarding the impact of BGP on patient
outcomes is constantly evolving, with changes in the availability, utilization, and efficacy of targeted agents. As
such, BGP use raises a fundamental question in cancer care: how can stakeholders make the most informed
decisions in the presence of uncertainty? We posit that Value of Information (VOI) analysis, which explicitly
quantifies the trade-off between the benefits of collecting further evidence compared to a decision based on
current evidence, can be used to guide decisions regarding BGP. In this proposal, we address the critical need
to understand real-world 1) BGP use and its impact on 2) clinical decision-making, 3) treatment outcomes and
costs and 4) the value of additional research to empirically inform decisions about the adoption of BGP into
cancer care by leveraging the strengths of multiple complementary, real-world datasets.
Aim 1: Utilization of BGP across contemporary U.S. cancer care. We will examine BGP use in advanced
cancer and drivers of testing within patients with (Aim 1A) Medicare 100% Fee-for-Service and Medicare
Advantage and (Aim 1B) Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance coverage.
Aim 2: BGP results and their impact on treatment patterns in NSCLC. We will quantify the frequency of
actionable mutations among patients with aNSCLC (Aim 2A) and assess the relationship between BGP and
cancer management strategy, given that less than half of patients with a targetable mutation may receive the
corresponding FDA-approved targeted therapy (Aim 2B).
Aim 3: BGP cost and survival. We will determine the relationship between BGP use and cancer care costs
(Aim 3A) and overall and cancer-specific survival (Aim 3B).
Aim 4: Cost Effectiveness & Value of Information. We will use VOI analysis to determine whether additional
evidence/research is needed to support the use of BGP. Specifically, we will compare the long-term health and
cost outcomes associated with 1st line BGP in patients with aNSCLC (currently recommended but
controversial) with two alternate strategies that focus on a smaller number of genetic tests. We will quantify
critical gaps in the evidence that drive uncertainty regarding effectiveness of BGP and quantify the value of
conducting additional research on BGP in order to improve decisions about optimal implementation of BGP.
The proposed research is significant given uncertainty regarding the use and effectiveness of BGP, innovative
given the triangulation across multiple large datasets and incorporation of VOI to guide practice and inform
policy, and clinically relevant given the high burden of advanced cancer and the burgeoning use of BGP."
10800133,"Project Summary
Cancer genomics has transformed the study and treatment of cancer. Nevertheless, the interpretation of
genetic alterations observed in tumor samples remains a major challenge in both basic science and clinical
settings. The functional roles of the vast majority of somatic alterations observed within cancer cells are
unknown: it is typically not known if a specific mutation plays a role in cancer growth or anti-cancer immune
response, or what impact (if any) an observed alteration has on cellular pathways. These gaps in knowledge
are major impediments towards personalized cancer treatments, from uncovering actionable mutations that
can be targeted by drugs to designing personalized cancer neoantigen vaccines. Further, for diverse
population groups to reap the benefits of cancer genomics, it is critical to develop computational methods that
explicitly consider genome variation and that are designed to identify and potentially mitigate inequities. Our
long-term goal is to develop computational approaches that work well across diverse populations in identifying
medically relevant alterations within cancer genomes. We have developed a powerful suite of methods to
discover cancer driver genes based upon integrating observed somatic mutations with knowledge about
cellular networks and a multidimensional view of protein functionality at the level of individual sites. We will
build upon on our prior work by devising machine learning approaches to predict which specific somatic
mutations within genes drive cancer, along with software to visualize and interpret mutations with respect to
newly derived protein functional features. We will introduce integrative formulations to uncover the impact of
somatic alterations on downstream genes and pathways. We will devise approaches to uncover immune-
relevant somatic mutations based on predicting interactions between major histocompatibility complex proteins
and peptides mutated in cancer. We will design our approaches to be effective as well as equitable across the
diversity of human populations. We will release open-source implementations of the developed computational
methods. This project will advance the state-of-the-art in computational methods for interpreting cancer
genomes, deepen our understanding of cancer biology, and move the field further towards unlocking the
promise of personalized cancer treatments in an equitable manner."
10811786,"In this project we aim to determine the role of epicardially-derived cells (EPDCs) in the formation
of the atrioventricular (AV) valves and to investigate their potential role in the pathogenesis of
myxomatous valve disease (MVD). A few years ago, we published a study in which we described
how EPDCs at the atrioventricular (AV) junction contribute to a specific set of leaflets of the AV
valves. To obtain insight into how these events are regulated, we initially focused on growth factor
signaling through the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway. We deleted the BMP receptor
ALK3/BMPR1A from the epicardial cell lineage using the epicardial-specific WT1cre mouse. We
observed that this led to abnormalities at the AV junction, including a significant decrease in the
number of AV-EPDCs in the lateral valve leaflets. We also found that, after birth, the valves
developed a myxomatous valve phenotype, reminiscent of that being observed in patients
suffering MVD. Deleting the transcription factor SOX9 from the epicardial cell lineage led to similar
results. The goals of this project are to determine the mechanisms regulating the migration of AV-
EPDCs into the parietal AV valve leaflet, to establish how AV-EPDCs regulate AV valve
development, and to elucidate their role in the pathogenesis of mitral valve disease."

Advances in immunotherapy, especially PD1/PD-L1 immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), are revolutionizing the
approach to personalized treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) with significant
positive clinical results. However, a large percentage of HNSCC patients still receive no benefit from this
treatment due to undefined mechanisms of resistance. Designing personalized targeted therapies with verified
biomarkers has been challenging due to the complex molecular etiology of the disease. Thus, there is an urgent
need to define resistance mechanisms operating within the tumor microenvironment (TME) to develop new
therapeutic paradigms that can effectively and safely treat HNSCC. Our long-term goal is to understand the roots
of pathogenic signaling during HNSCC progression. This proposal is based substantial published and preliminary
data showing that cadherin desmoglein 2 (Dsg2) modulates cell growth, survival, and metastasis and is
upregulated in many cancers including HNSCC where Dsg2 is often found overexpressed at the aggressive
leading edge of the tumors. Most importantly, mAb targeting Dsg2 inhibits tumor development in xenograft
model. Using these mAb we recently generated the anti-Dsg2 scFv CAR construct and the resultant Dsg2 CAR-
T cells not only recognized SCC cells but had robust in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity. Mounting evidence
suggests that exosomes or small extracellular vesicles (sEV) regulate local and systemic processes impacting
tumor progression and therapeutic outcomes. This proposal is based on solid preliminary data obtained from an
ICI clinical trial where sEV were purified from patients’ plasma and subjected to miRNAseq revealing an increase
in miR-155-5p (miR-155) in HPVneg patients that responded to treatment. miR-155 targets Dsg2 and PD-L1
mRNAs and their translation, suggesting that miR-155-loaded sEV could have antitumor activity. Our working
hypothesis is that engineered extracellular vesicles (eEV) carrying the Dsg2scFv-CD63 fusion proteins on the
surface and loaded with miR-155 can be harnessed for therapeutic treatment of Dsg2-overexpressing cancers.
The hypothesis and goal will be addressed in two Specific Aims designed to: 1) Engineer Dsg2scFv/miR-155
eEV and 2) Determine the antitumor activity of Dsg2scFv/miR-155 eEV. This proposal will deliver innovations in
defining blood-borne molecules that modulate ICI resistance in HNSCC patients, along with an opportunity to
rationally leverage this new knowledge through a unique proof-of-concept sEV therapy which represents a
cutting edge of the field."
10811546,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Disuse, denervation, and several diseases result in skeletal muscle atrophy and
weakness – a major contributor to disease-related disability and death. The mechanisms
underlying these processes are incompletely understood, and therapeutics are only emerging.
 MicroRNAs are known to regulate many important cellular processes. We discovered
that in muscle developing weakness due to disuse (human) and denervation (mouse), there is a
marked reduction in microRNA320. Further, bioinformatic analysis demonstrates that FoxOs –
a group of transcription factors important in muscle degradation -- are potential targets of
miR320. Indeed, when we disrupted miR320 in cultured muscle cells, the FoxO pathway and
protein ubiquitination were upregulated. There is also evidence from others that miR320 may
have roles in skeletal muscle metabolism.
 Given these findings, we created a muscle-specific knockout mouse (miR320mKO) to
explore the role of this miRNA in controlling skeletal muscle growth and maintenance in a long-
term, in vivo model. We have found that these mice develop severe muscle wasting over their
first 4 months of life.
 This project will fully characterize the miR320mKO mice at the phenotypic level,
investigate the mechanisms by which this phenotype occurs, and carry out a pilot effort at
miR320 treatment in a model of mouse muscle atrophy. It promises to open up new avenues in
treatment of skeletal muscle disease.
Specifically, we will:
 1. Characterize the phenotype of miR320mKO mice
 -examine muscle size and microscopy, fiber size and type, muscle contractile force in
 KO vs. controls; examine growth of proliferation and myotube formation of miR320mKO
 primary muscle cell cultures
2. Investigate the mechanisms underlying the phenotype of miR320mKO mice
 -dissect operant molecular signaling pathways and events using RNA sequencing;
 identify potential targets of miR320 by miR-eCLIP and RNA sequencing, and confirm
 those targets with 3’UTR luciferase reporters in C2C12 cells
3. Carry out a pilot treatment of skeletal muscle wasting with miR320 in mice
 -study denervated limb muscle following delivery of miR320 via electroporation vs.

Contemporaneous urban vector control (truck-mounted ultra-low volume spraying, thermal fogging,
larviciding) has failed to contain dengue epidemics and to prevent the global range expansion of Aedes-
borne viruses (ABVs: dengue, chikungunya, Zika). Part of the challenge in sustaining effective ABV
control emerges from the remarkable paucity of evidence about the epidemiological impact of any
vector control method. Furthermore, the classic deployment of interventions in response to clinical cases
fails to account for the important contribution of out-of-home human mobility and asymptomatic infections.
Novel vector control approaches and intervention delivery strategies to contain ABVs are urgently needed.
Targeted indoor residual spraying (TIRS, applying residual insecticides on Aedes aegypti resting
sites such as exposed low walls [<1.5m], under furniture, and on dark surfaces) is a rational vector
control approach that exploits Ae. aegypti resting behavior to focalize insecticide applications with
no loss in residual efficacy. Recently published systematic reviews have identified TIRS as a very
promising approach for ABD prevention, but highlighted the limited evidence-base for this intervention due to
the absence of efficacy estimates from randomized controlled trials with epidemiological endpoints performed
in endemic settings. In response to such critical need, we will pursue a two-arm, parallel, unblinded
cluster randomized trial to quantify the overall efficacy of TIRS in reducing the burden of laboratory-
confirmed (virologically or serologically) ABV clinical disease (e.g., dengue, Zika or chikungunya)
(primary endpoint). Secondary endpoints will include: a) Laboratory-confirmed (serologically) DENV, CHIKV
or ZIKV seroconversion in children aged 2-15 at enrollment; b) Ae. aegypti mosquito infection rates with
DENV, CHIKV or ZIKV; c) Ae. aegypti indoor entomological indices. The trial will be conducted in the city of
Merida (Yucatan State, Mexico, population ~1million), where we will prospectively follow a population of
4,600 children 2-15 years at enrollment, distributed in 50 clusters of 5x5 city blocks each (~92 children per
cluster), randomly allocated to receive either TIRS treatment (n=25) or not (n=25). Trained personnel from
the Federal Ministry of Health will perform TIRS in all houses from the treatment clusters ~1-2 months prior to
the beginning of the peak ABV transmission season. Active monitoring for symptomatic ABD infections will
be performed by field nurses and doctors through weekly household visits and enhanced surveillance (phone
calls, monitoring of suspected cases to Merida’s hospital/clinic system), whereas annual sero-surveys will be
performed after each transmission season. If efficacious, TIRS will drive a paradigm shift in Aedes control by:
considering Ae. aegypti behavior to guide insecticide applications; change to preemptive control (pre- ABV
transmission season rather than in response to symptomatic cases); the use of insecticide formulations to
which Ae. Aegypti is susceptible."
10813019,"As the risk for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has increased to a higher rate
in veterans relative to that in the general population, there is an urgent need to develop effective
therapies to treat PDAC for veterans in the VA system. Recently, cancer immunotherapy has
shown great promise in several cancers, but not in PDAC. Part of the reason for this is the
heterogeneity of PDAC and lack of tailoring of immunotherapy to individual tumor subtypes.
PDAC patient stratification for therapy remains in its infancy, and a reliable method to
deconvolute complex tumor composition to stratify PDAC subtypes has not been recognized.
Recently, we participated in whole genome sequencing of PDAC specimens, which provides the
basis for classifying PDAC into four subtypes based upon patterns of genomic structural
variation (Nature, 2016). Among these, the immunogenic subtype accounts for 30% of 178
PDAC samples in the TCGA database and is characterized by upregulated immune cell
networks, which could indicate differential responses to immunotherapy. In addition, the
Epigenomic Deconvolution (EDec) method, first developed by our co-investigator Dr.
Milosavljevic’s group, provides valuable information about cell type composition of tumors and
cell-type specific gene expression (Cell Rep. 2016). When applied to immunogenic subtype
PDAC tumors, EDec reveals an immunosuppressive microenvironment characterized by the
highest Foxp3 expression among all four subtypes. Cancer cells falling into the immunogenic
subtype also show the highest mesothelin (MSLN) expression. Therefore, we hypothesize that
PDACs with an immunogenic profile could be a target subgroup that is responsive to
immunotherapy either by MSLN virus-like particle (VLP) vaccination or combination therapy of
VLPs and an immune checkpoint inhibitor. We will test our hypothesis in pre-clinical animal
models that best recapitulate human PDAC patient’s response to immunotherapy, including
patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) and humanized mouse models. Our preliminary data
have shown that our anti-MSLN VLP vaccine is effective against MSLN-high expressing PDX in
a humanized NSG mouse model (PDX-hu-NSG). Based on our strong preliminary results, we
propose to develop an effective cancer immunotherapeutic approach by combining three highly
synergistic innovations: (1) A novel epigenetic deconvolution method to stratify PDAC tumors;
(2) PDX-hu-NSG models; and (3) Combination therapy of MSLN-VLP vaccine plus anti-PD-1
antibody. We propose two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine whether the immunogenic
subtype of PDAC is responsive to MSLN-VLP vaccine in PDX-hu-NSG model. Here, we will
use EDec method to stratify VA PDACs by subtype and then determine MSLN-VLP vaccine
efficacy in specific PDAC subgroups in humanized PDX mouse model. In Aim 2, we will
determine whether combination therapy with anti-PD-1 Ab enhances MSLN VLP vaccine
responses and efficacy in onco-humice model. We will also determine specific tumor infiltrating
subset of cells that are responsible for the effective combination therapy. Furthermore, potential
side-effect of the combination therapy will also be evaluated. Our findings will provide preclinical
evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of an innovative precision immunotherapy for PDAC in
humanized mice without putting patients at risk. The project will provide understanding of
molecular, cellular, and tissue-level responses to therapy, a key step towards improved
outcomes in PDAC through patient stratification for therapy."

Accumulating evidence from rodent studies suggests that the expression of fear emerges from
electrophysiological changes within a neural network that includes the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC),
basolateral amygdala (BLA), and anterior hippocampus (aHPC)5. It is unclear whether this network exhibits
similar dynamics during fear-related states in humans and how this activity is altered during inappropriate
expression of fear that is often observed in individuals with anxiety-related disorders such as post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The proposed study will investigate the
relationship between deep brain activity (intracranial electroencephalographic and single unit) and physiological
response (skin conductance response, pupil size, and heart rate/variability) in humans who are implanted with
microwire electrodes for clinical evaluation and treatment of epilepsy who will complete a virtual reality fear
conditioning task. Over the project period, the study will have access to 25 rare participants with and without
anxiety disorders (i.e. post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] and/or generalized anxiety disorder [GAD])
implanted with depth electrodes in the vmPFC, BLA, and/or aHPC through an ongoing collaboration between
clinical and basic science leaders at UCLA and the Veteran’s Administration Greater Los Angeles Healthcare
System. Since our studies address basic questions surrounding the role of vmPFC-BLA-aHPC dynamics in
regulating fear response, a process often compromised in psychiatric disease, it is anticipated that findings will
bridge decades of human and animal fear-related research and lay the scientific foundation for improved
understanding and treatment of anxiety-related disorders.
In addition to completing the described research, I will undergo extensive professional and academic training to
prepare me for my ultimate-goal of becoming a neurosurgeon-scientist. This will include mentorship from basic
scientist experts in invasive human recording compatible experiments (Dr. Nanthia Suthana) and high level
statistical analysis (Dr. Jonathan Kao) in addition to clinical and investigative guidance from a neurosurgeon-
scientist (Dr. Jean Phillipe Langevin). Through working with these individuals along with my senior collaborators
(Drs. Michelle Craske and Michael Fanselow), I will learn to design clinically relevant behavioral experiments,
record invasive human neurophysiology, obtain expert knowledge in neuroscience and neuroanatomy, achieve
a highly developed skillset for signals processing and statistical analysis and hone my clinical, writing, and
presentation skills."
10815437,"With persistent healthcare disparities experienced by US minority groups, there is an urgent need to prioritize
health equity and reorient healthcare systems around this issue. This is especially apparent in quality and
safety, an area of national attention for over two decades, yet progress has been limited. In response, quality
experts, including AHRQ, urge healthcare systems to embed equity into all quality and safety efforts, ensure
resources and infrastructure, engage patients and communities as partners, expand diversity in the workforce,
and equip quality and safety leaders within healthcare systems to reduce health disparities. Our proposal is
directly responsive to this call to action, as the Columbia-Cornell-Einstein EQUIP+ Center for Learning
Health System (LHS) Science is laser focused on the intersection of health equity and quality through a
comprehensive embedded LHS Scientist training and research program. Our purpose is to address Equity and

anything that is not related to drug use when reminders of drug use are present, exacerbating craving and
producing relapse. We have recently uncovered a novel neural locus that appears to bias learning and behavior
towards cues that are immediately related to rewards. Specifically, we have found that GABAergic neurons in
the lateral hypothalamus (LH) drive learning and behavior directed to information related to rewards, while
actively opposing learning about other relationships in the environment that are not immediately relevant to
rewards. This is the first time one region has been found to contribute to this dissociation. We can see how a
change in this balance in learning and behavior mediated by LH could contribute to addiction; increases in LH
function seen following drug exposure could potentiate cue-elicited drug seeking while trying to remain abstinent,
hijacking the adaptive function of LH to focus on cues that help predict rewards that likely promote survival under
normal circumstances. This work will provide insight into how the pathophysiological state of addiction can
contribute to relapse even during voluntary abstinence, and suggest a neural target that could drive pre-clinical
work to develop treatments for SUDs.
This proposal will test a novel theoretical framework to account for the influence LH has over learning.
Specifically, we hypothesize that LH GABAergic neurons bias learning towards cues proximal to rewards, and
away from those more distal to rewards. To test this, we have developed an innovative task taken from the
cognitive neuroscience literature based on human participants, allowing us to isolate behavior and neural activity
during both proximal and distal predictors of rewards in the same animal. Further, we will uncover the nature of
learning about proximal cues supported by LH function. On the basis of preliminary data, we hypothesize this
will involve a sensory-specific representation of reward, which allows LH to influence behavior in flexible and
specific ways. Finally, our preliminary work also demonstrates that methamphetamine self-administration
enhances the control that cues proximal to rewards have over behavior, and that this is also dependent on a
specific reward representation. This expands our knowledge of the behavioral change that results from SUDs,
standing as a counterpoint to many theories of addiction that focus on and enhancement of habitual behavior,
which is without voluntary control and devoid of reward representations. On the basis of preliminary work, we
hypothesize that enhancements of LH GABAergic neuronal function after drug exposure produces this effect.
Accordingly, we will directly test our theory that LH GABA neurons promote a bias towards proximal cues in a
specific manner, and that this function is enhanced in following drug exposure."
10814774,"The accumulation of particular proteins into long fibrillar aggregates known as amyloids is a common feature of
many devastating aging-related pathologies. In type II diabetes mellitus, the main constituent of these
aggregates is Islet Amyloid Polypeptide (IAPP, also known as amylin). Like many other amyloidogenic
proteins, the aggregation of IAPP has been linked to cellular dysfunction and death. However, the mechanism
by which IAPP aggregates form and how this aggregation is linked to cell death remain mysterious. To help
reduce this gap, we propose to characterize the oligomeric intermediates of human-IAPP formed in solution, in
presence of metals (such as zinc and copper), and in lipid-membrane via three specific aims. 1) In Aim 1, we
propose to characterize the intermediates formed by human-IAPP at atomic resolution by NMR spectroscopy.
The identified oligomeric intermediates will be tested for cell toxicity and the structural models derived from
NMR constraints will be used to evaluate the mechanism and efficiency of amyloid inhibitors. 2) Since a
possible genetic link between zinc regulation and type II diabetes has been discovered, we will characterize
zinc-IAPP adducts by cell toxicity, NMR and other biophysical experiments in Aim 2. Mutants of oxidized and
reduced forms of human-IAPP will be used to probe the metal binding sites, and isothermal titration
experiments will be used to measure the metal binding affinities to different amyloid species. In addition, the
non-fibril forming and non-toxic rat-IAPP and pramlintide (trade name symlin approved by FDA for use by both
type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients) will be used as controls. 3) To gain insight into the lipid-membrane assisted
hIAPP aggregation and the mechanism by which hIAPP disrupts the lipid-membrane, we propose to
characterize the role of lipid membrane by a variety of biophysical techniques (including high-speed atomic
force microscopy), and stabilize hIAPP oligomeric intermediates using lipid-nanodisc technology and solve the
high-resolution structure of oligomers by a combination of solid-state and solution NMR techniques. These
high-resolution structures will aid in the development of drugs to stop beta-cell death."

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder that affects up to 20% of children worldwide. AD
has been highlighted as the first step in the “atopic march”, whereby AD typically predates the development of
other allergic disorders. Atopic sensitization and food allergy have been reported to be precursors of AD
progression to respiratory allergy, however recent data indicate that the mechanisms are far more complex. The
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recently convened a workshop titled ``Atopic dermatitis and
the atopic march: mechanisms and interventions''6 and they concluded that only about 3% of children follow what
has been conventionally referred to as the atopic march. They stated that a new prospective cohort study that
uses multiparameter approaches to define phenotypic/endotypic subgroups of AD and to predict AD outcomes
is needed. As part of our U19 Asthma and Allergic Diseases Cooperative Research Center (AADCRC) funded
by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, we have built the first mechanistic longitudinal cohort
study of pediatric atopic dermatitis (AD), the Mechanisms of Progression of Atopic Dermatitis to Asthma in
Children (MPAACH). MPAACH is the first early life prospective cohort of children with AD in the US and
incorporates extensive evaluations of skin, gut, airway and peripheral blood, as well as the use of multiparameter
approaches to define phenotypic and endotypic subgroups of AD. Thus far, we have enrolled 537 children. The
goals of the MPAACH cohort are to define AD phenotypes and endotypes, dissect the mechanisms that
contribute to the progression of AD to other allergic disorders (food allergy, allergic rhinitis, asthma), and
delineate the immunologic, skin, biome, genetic/epigenetic/genomic, physiologic, and environmental factors that
promote the development of allergic comorbidities in children with AD. To enable mechanistic studies, extensive
biospecimens are collected from lesional and non-lesional skin. We have 20 years of experience and expertise
in conducting large cohort studies and are uniquely positioned to contribute to ADRN and SUNBEAM due to our
current cohorts and clinical research infrastructure, as well as our experienced and diverse large staff, who are
experts in recruitment, regulatory affairs, conducting visits, collection and processing of biospecimens, and
execution and reporting of studies. Based on our strong preliminary data from MPAACH, we are proposing 3
CRC-specific research projects to address our overarching hypothesis is that visually normal skin may have skin
barrier dysfunction that becomes clinically evident (lesional) or remains subclinical (no lesions), but in both cases
the skin barrier dysfunction coupled with dysbiosis of skin microbiome triggers alarmins, which initiates an
immunologic cascade that promotes the subsequent development of allergic disease including food allergy,
asthma and allergic rhinitis."

Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and child
health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the country,
a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years, under RFA-
DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the consortium, and will track
their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health, and
culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual
interviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of
developmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and
parents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through
adolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our
understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping) interact
with each other and with a child’s changing biology to affect brain development and social, behavioral, academic,
health, and other outcomes.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen time,
sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences influence brain development; (5)
determine and replicate factors that influence mental health from childhood to young adulthood; (6) characterize
relationships between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of substances such as
cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine affects developmental outcomes, and how neural, cognitive, emotional,
and environmental factors influence the risk for adolescent substance use."

tailored for RNAs and RNA-protein complexes, including construct design, expression testing, and development
of purification protocols, and in biophysical characterization of purified macromolecules and complexes. These
contributions in molecular biology and biophysics are not only critical to the crystallography focus of the Core,
but are also available to CRNA Projects as needed for production and characterization of proteins or RNA-protein

proteins, RNAs and RNA-protein complexes to CRNA labs. The Core lab at the University of Michigan will serve
as a repository for materials and protocols. The Core team is co-led by PIs Janet Smith (University of Michigan)
and Jinwei Zhang (NIDDK, NIH), who brings expertise in the design of RNAs and RNA-protein complexes for
crystallization. The Core team will focus on three aims. The Core will develop or adapt cutting-edge methods for
RNA designs to facilitate expression, RNA-protein co-expression, crystallization chaperones for RNA, and
establishment of an in vitro RNA synthesis capability. In support of its crystallography mission, the Core will
develop cutting-edge methods to aid RNA crystallization, to improve the diffraction quality and solve the phase

In this Project, we will analyze the structures and molecular transformations of the HIV-1 RNA molecules that
become packaged into virions as genomic RNA (gRNA). Beginning with events in the cell, we will elucidate how
transcription start site usage defines the structure of the HIV-1 RNA 5’-leader, which, in turn, dictates whether
the RNA will dimerize and function as gRNA or remain monomeric and function as messenger RNA. We will
study how the dimeric gRNA recruits the viral Gag protein to generate a complex that nucleates assembly of the
immature virion. Finally, we will look at processes that occur during virion maturation, in which the gRNA
condenses into a viral ribonucleoprotein complex, is re-packaged inside the mature capsid, anneals with the
tRNA primer, and prepares for reverse transcription. Our proposed studies will provide deep fundamental
understanding of these processes, which represent some of the most critical but incompletely elucidated
molecular mechanisms in HIV-1 replication. Importantly, we are now also poised to exploit this understanding
towards the identification, characterization and development of novel inhibitors targeted against HIV-1 RNA and
RNA complexes. Collectively, our team of investigators have a strong track record and expertise in determining
structures of large RNAs and RNA:protein complexes using state-of-the-art techniques; in analyzing their
biochemical and biophysical properties in vitro, in virions, and in cells; in visualizing the complexes as they

10789911,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Developmental stuttering is a dynamic, multifactorial neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by unintended
disruptions in fluent speech production. Speech planning and production rely on intact speech sound processing,
which helps develop and maintain internal speech sound models. Unstable internal speech sound models, which
regulate motor signals in the speech motor articulatory network (SMAN), may contribute to disfluent speech in
children who stutter (CWS). In concert with frontoparietal attention network, SMAN also modulates attention to
phonetic/syllabic information in speech, particularly in difficult listening conditions. CWS often perform worse on
speech processing tasks than fluent peers, especially on more challenging tasks, potentially due to inefficiencies
in these auxiliary networks. However, the underlying causes of speech processing deficits in CWS remain
unclear. A mechanistic understanding of speech sound processing will facilitate future development of
neurobiologically informed stuttering interventions that target the specific neural deficits in CWS. The current
proposal extends previous findings of atypical speech sound processing in CWS. Combining the complementary
expertise of a cross-disciplinary team of investigators, the current project will evaluate the integrity of neural
processes underlying speech sound encoding and the ways in which these processes are modulated by task
demands using multimodal neuroimaging and systems-level computational modeling approaches. Aim 1 will
measure electroencephalography (EEG) in 150 CWS and 150 fluent peers, aged 7-15 years, while children
complete four tasks of varying difficulty: A) a syllable identification task (/ba/ vs /da/) in quiet; B) a continuous
speech narrative comprehension task in quiet; and C & D) complex speech encoding tasks with syllables and
continuous speech presented simultaneously, with attention directed either toward syllables (C) or toward the
narrative (D). Directly comparing neural responses elicited in simpler and more complex listening conditions
(A/C, B/D) and responses to the same stimuli when attended vs. ignored (C/D) is critical for characterizing effects
of task demands on speech sound processing. State-of-the-art machine-learning approaches for EEG will enable
simultaneous extraction of temporally precise neural representations of fast and slow temporal fluctuations in
speech in the transformation from acoustic to syllable representations. Aim 2 will leverage functional MRI (fMRI)
to assess multiple neural systems underlying speech sound processing in CWS. Employing the same tasks in
the same participants as Aim 1 will allow for quantifying neural activations and representations in auditory,
SMAN, and attention networks during simple and complex speech tasks. Aim 3 will develop a systems-level
computational model of speech sound processing in CWS. The model, based on combined EEG and fMRI data,
will simulate how interactions between neural networks mediate task performance across listening conditions.
This project will provide a mechanistic understanding of speech sound processing in CWS and a unique, curated,
open access, multimodal neuroimaging dataset that will be a lasting resource for the field of stuttering."

Malaria causes large numbers of deaths per year including 200,000 miscarriages due to placental malaria. We
lack an effective malaria vaccine partially because we do not fully understand the mechanism of antibody
mediated protection. Antibodies are predominantly thought to be effective through blocking mechanisms.
However, we hypothesize that protective antibodies in Plasmodium infection bind infected RBC surface proteins
for recognition and killing by natural killer (NK) cells. We have data showing that NK cells inhibit the growth of
Plasmodium in vitro through antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). We went on to show that a subset
of NK cells, γ neg NK cells, have enhanced ADCC function and abundance of γ neg NK cells correlates with
reduced parasitemia and protection from malaria in a large endemic malaria cohort. This proposal aims to
understand how these γ neg NK cells increase function and abundance in the context of malaria infection. We
will test the CD16 cascade with CRISPR/Cas9 ablations to understand why γ neg NK cells have enhanced ADCC
function. We will use CRISPR/Cas9 to ablate effector and adhesion molecules to understand how NK cells inhibit
the growth of Plasmodium. We will also test the underlying mechanism of malaria exposure that drives the
increase in γ neg NK cells and test if γ neg NK cells expand with ADCC and malarial cytokine signals. We also
aim to define NK cell ADCC protective mechanisms against the placental malaria target Var2CSA. Var2CSA is
a protein on the surface of the infected RBC that adheres to the placenta and can cause miscarriages. We will
test if antibodies that are good at generating NK cell ADCC responses increase with Var2CSA exposure and
correlate with protective pregnancy outcomes in human and monkey samples. We will also test previously
identified and novel monoclonal antibodies for NK cell ADCC function and dissect the features that generate a
strong NK ADCC response. These aims in total will create a body of work that will contribute to the development
of better vaccines and therapeutics for malaria. This would change vaccine targets to be proteins on the surface
of infected RBCs instead of invasion proteins, predictive efficacy readouts would include NK cell ADCC assays,
and antibodies developed here may be future immune therapies."
10789917,"ABSTRACT
The central problem addressed by this proposal is how the brain represents almost limitless objects to “catego-
rize an unlabeled world” (Edelman, 1976). This problem is particularly acute in olfaction, because physical odor
signals are not obviously dimensional. While instinctual meanings are imparted through the structure of neural
circuits, learning mechanisms can theoretically select experience-relevant representations from circuits lacking
a priori structure. By analogy, the vertebrate adaptive immune system defends against novel invaders by se-
lectively amplifying B cells carrying strongly binding antibodies from a randomly produced pool. How unstruc-
tured, combinatorial connectivity forms during development is not understood in any system. The numerical
complexity of vertebrate olfactory cortex and other associative learning centers including the cerebellum, hip-
pocampus, and entorhinal cortex complicates developmental studies. Instead, we propose to address this
question in the numerically simplified olfactory learning center of arthropods, the mushroom body. While this
brain area performs a function similar to the cortex or cerebellum, representing objects as combinations of sen-
sory stimuli, the fruit fly mushroom body has only 2000 intrinsic neurons. These intrinsic Kenyon cells receive
3-10 olfactory inputs, with each cell receiving different inputs. The sets of inputs to individual Kenyon cells are
unpredictable—knowing one input to a particular cell does not illuminate which other inputs that cell receives.
To ask how unstructured connectivity pattern forms during development, we are first using a variety of tech-
niques to manipulate the ratio between Kenyon cells and their incoming olfactory inputs in order to identify
mechanisms that set the number of inputs to individual Kenyon cells. Second, we are testing whether variation
in expression of cell surface molecules across pre- and post-synaptic cells allows variation in connectivity be-
tween them. The quantitative complexity and density of sensory inputs to associative brain areas are theorized
to “optimize” representations of sensory objects, with alterations in these patterns expected to degrade neural
and behavioral distinctions among stimuli. If successful, we will produce a model of the developmental mecha-
nisms that generate neurons responding to complex sensory stimuli that can be applied to studying develop-
ment and organization of sensory inputs to vertebrate associative learning areas; this study will also create
techniques to manipulate the wiring parameters of the Drosophila mushroom body to explicitly test how wiring
parameters dictate stimulus representation and separation, and how their alteration alters perception and
learning."
10790014,"SUMMARY
Drug-induced cardiac toxicity, in the form of QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, is an uncommon but
devastating side effect of over one hundred currently marketed drugs. The ubiquity of drug-induced QT
prolongation (diLQTS) across medical specialties and conditions creates a challenge for providers seeking to
prescribe known QT-prolonging medications, particularly for non-cardiac conditions. Work by our group to
develop automated clinical decision support (CDS) tools that alert providers of patient risk has shown promise
towards reducing the number of prescriptions to at-risk individuals. However, these tools rely on a history of an
electrocardiogram (ECG) with QT prolongation to identify at-risk patients, and thus exclude a large number of
potentially at-risk individuals who have not had an ECG within our system. Through a unique institutional
partnership with Google, in which a copy of our entire electronic health record (EHR) is stored on the Google
Cloud Platform (GCP), we have developed preliminary deep-learning models to predict risk of diLQTS. We
have also validated the genetic association with the QT interval and diLQTS across several real-world
populations using an aggregate polygenic risk score. Through creation of an institutional biobank with
certification for clinical application of results, as well as cloud-based integration of EHR data with genetic data,
we have the capability to leverage our existing infrastructure to study the role of deep learning and genetics to
reduce the risk of diLQTS. This investigation will combine our unique research and clinical
infrastructure on the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus with our investigative team
composed of experts in the study of pharmacogenomics and medical informatics to develop and study
an end-to-end CDS tool incorporating genetics and deep learning to predict risk of diLQTS. The
specific aims of this application include the following: (1) develop and test a cloud-based, deep-learning model
using EHR data on in- and outpatients to predict risk of diLQTS; (2) validate genetic predictors of diLQTS using
institutional biobank samples, and a multi-ethnic external population; and (3) develop and test CDS tools using
these advanced methods to reduce the risk of diLQTS. We will use a common data model (Observational
Medical Outcomes Partnership) mapped from EHR data, as well as a custom DNA array (Multi-Ethnic
Genotyping Array) designed for imputation across a variety of non-European ancestries, to ensure that the our
prediction model and findings from this study can be replicated in other institutions and populations in the
future. In such a way, this investigation will not only provide insight into the use of machine learning and
genetics for risk prediction of diLQTS, but it will also create a blueprint for future advanced CDS development
for other conditions."
10785813,"TRANSLATION OF NONINVASIVE METABOLIC BIOMARKERS TO TARGETED THERAPY FOR CANCER
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The genetic mutations that make a living cell become cancer produce faulty signaling cascades that alter the
cell’s metabolic processes and metabolites. This metabolic reprogramming, called the Warburg effect, is present
in most cancers. It is demonstrated primarily by increased lactate formation from glucose, despite proper oxy-
genation and functional mitochondria. In addition, macromolecule precursors favoring cell growth and division
are also increased (e.g., alanine for protein synthesis). Notably, new cancer therapies target these faulty cas-
cades. Thus, successful treatment with these targeted therapies must modify the metabolite content in the tumor.
 For example, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), hyperactive in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), alters the B-cell
receptor signaling cascade. Thus, the hyperactive BTK favors cancer processes, including the Warburg effect.
Therefore, BTK inhibition (BTKi) is a potential treatment choice for MCL.
 Our preclinical studies showed lactate and alanine reductions in BTKi-sensitive human MCL cell lines in cul-
ture and MCL xenografts. In comparison, MCL models unresponsive to BTKi do not show these metabolic
changes. Notably, these metabolic changes during effective BTKi therapy precede the objective evidence of
tumor response to therapy (i.e., reduction of viability in cultured cell lines or tumor volume in xenografts).
 Our overall goal is to assess the clinical translatability of our preclinical studies. Thus, our central hypothesis
states that the altered tumor content of lactate and alanine in BTKi-sensitive tumors of MCL patients precede
the reduction of tumor burden, supporting their potential use as predictive biomarkers of response. However, to
test our hypothesis, we aim to assess the feasibility of measuring lactate and alanine in tumors of MCL patients.
 Our group has helped develop and improve a robust magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging method, the
Hadamard-selective multiple quantum coherence (Had-Sel-MQC). We adapted this method to measure lactate
and alanine selectively, making it a simplified evaluation of the Warburg effect. Additionally, the Had-Sel-MQC
anatomically localizes lactate and alanine, allowing their noninvasive assessment of tumors in their place in the
body (i.e., in situ). Furthermore, we have transferred the Had-Sel-MQC to clinical whole-body magnetic reso-
nance imagers and recently improved it for its application to human subjects (Lee, 2022, doi: 10.1088/2057-
1976/ac57ad, and Lee, 2022, doi: 10.1016/j.mri.2022.08.020).
 We will study 15 healthy volunteers and 30 MCL patients in this feasibility project. Our specific goal is to
ensure that the MRSI exam achieves proper localization of tumor signals with the best spectral quality (i.e.,
improved B0-shimming and water and lipid suppression) irrespective of the body part studied. In addition, we will
pay special attention to tumors in the torso to assess how cardiac and respiration movements affect the exam
and determine the best way to minimize their effect."
10785881,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Children with medical complexity (CMC) are the most vulnerable of children with chronic diseases, who have
complex, multisystem chronic diseases affecting ≥3 organ systems, severe functional limitations and technology
dependencies. CMC have high health care needs, and account for 40% of hospitalized children and 35% of all
pediatric health care costs. Due to high medical fragility, CMC have frequent acute deteriorations superimposed
on their chronic conditions, leading to recurrent emergency department (ED)/hospital admissions and affecting
quality of life (QOL). To reduce ED/hospital admissions for CMC, remote monitoring is suggested, with use of
mHealth apps to regularly assess their health status remotely and identify early signs of acute deterioration,
allowing for early interventions to prevent ED/hospital admissions. Yet no app to support remote monitoring of
CMC exists. Variable, multisystem conditions among CMC make it difficult to develop an app. Also, many CMC
are at high-risk for health care inequities, with minorities having higher unmet needs, but the impacts of health
care inequities and social determinants of health (SDOH) on ED/hospital admissions in CMC are rarely studied.
Fortunately, ED/hospital admissions for CMC are often preceded by a limited set of shared (crosscutting) acute
symptoms. These crosscutting symptoms rarely occur suddenly. Studies suggest that they usually start as subtle
signs, often unnoticed by parents until they escalate to prompt an ED/hospital visit. Thus, crosscutting symptoms
offer an opportunity for a novel and practical approach for developing a remote monitoring app for CMC,
despite their multiple, variable underlying conditions. In a focus group, parents identified the crosscutting
symptoms that most often preceded their children’s hospital admissions, and conveyed their needs, preferences
and key functionalities that led to MyChildCMC, the first app designed to monitor and identify early signs of
crosscutting symptoms in CMC. In a pilot trial of 50 subjects, we confirmed feasibility of MyChildCMC use by
parents, ability to detect early signs 2-14 days prior to ED/hospital admissions, and use leading significantly to
fewer hospital days than controls. The current study will assess the efficacy and sustainability of MyChildCMC
in a fully-powered 6-month, 2-arm (MyChildCMC vs usual care) trial of CMC (age 1-18 years) and their parents.
Parents assigned to MyChildCMC will use the app daily for 6 months, both arms will receive financial incentive
for participation, then we will stop the incentive and follow subjects for 6 more months to assess sustainability at
12 months. We will also assess if MyChildCMC use will help reduce or eliminate inequities in ED/hospital
admissions. Specific Aims are: 1) Determine MyChildCMC’s efficacy on 1.a. Child (ED/hospital use, hospital
days and QOL) and 1.b. Parent (satisfaction, self-efficacy and stress) outcomes; 2) Compare ED/hospital use
among racial/ethnic and SDOH subgroups to assess potential effect of MyChildCMC on inequities; 3) Use mixed
methods to identify child and parent factors associated with MyChildCMC’s use adherence and sustainability."
10790007,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance are associated with increased risk and worse outcomes for endometrial
cancer (EC). Metformin is a biguanide that is widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Epidemiological and pre-
clinical data suggest that metformin may have anti-tumorigenic activity, due to its indirect effects within the metabolic
milieu (↓insulin, ↓glucose) and direct effects on tumor cells through AMPK activation/mTOR inhibition and suppression
of fatty acid/lipid biosynthesis. Metformin is dependent on cation-selective transporters for entry into cells, and the
multi-drug and toxin extrusion transporters, MATE1 and 2, are expressed in human EC cell lines and tumors. Thus,
metformin may break the link between obesity and EC, emerging as a metabolically targeted agent for this disease.
 Within The Cancer Genome Atlas database, endometrioid ECs arising in obese versus non-obese women have
distinguishing patterns of gene expression, including upregulation of lipoprotein lipase and modulators of the
insulin/insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) pathway. These findings suggest that ECs arising in obesity may have distinct
metabolic vulnerabilities that could be targeted for treatment. In a phase 0 clinical trial of obese EC patients, short-term
metformin treatment reduced proliferation and decreased expression of the IGF-1 receptor and targets of the mTOR
pathway within the endometrial tumor tissues. Responders to metformin had higher pre-treatment levels of fatty
acids/glycolipids in their serum and MATE2 in their ECs, suggesting that these biomarkers might predict metformin
response. Lastly, in the LKB1fl/flp53fl/fl EC mouse model, diet-induced obesity led to a doubling of tumor size,
accompanied by increases in energy metabolism and lipid biosynthesis. Importantly, metformin had increased efficacy
against EC in obese versus lean mice and reversed the detrimental metabolic effects of obesity in the ECs, via shunting
fatty acids to beta-oxidation as opposed to lipid production.
 The overall goal of this proposal is to assess the contribution of indirect effects (via downregulation of
insulin/IGF-1 signaling) and direct effects (via transporter-dependent cell entry, activation of AMPK/inhibition of mTOR
signaling, blunting of fatty acid/lipid biosynthesis) of metformin (+/- chemotherapy) to its overall anti-cancer efficacy in
(i) a clinically relevant EC mouse (obese/lean) model and (ii) an ongoing randomized phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating
metformin versus placebo, in combination with standard of care paclitaxel/carboplatin for the treatment of EC [through
the NRG Oncology Group]. Our central hypothesis is that predictors of metformin response (+/- chemotherapy) will
include both molecular and metabolic biomarkers, specifically obesity, insulin resistance, upregulation of insulin/IGF-
1 signaling, heightened fatty acid/lipid biosynthesis and higher MATE 1/2 expression. The proposed research will
rigorously test this hypothesis in parallel pre-clinical and clinical studies and support it with diverse measurements of
metabolic and molecular markers associated with obesity and modulated by metformin treatment. This strategy should
delineate the interplay of metformin’s indirect and direct effects on tumor growth, identify metabolic and molecular
biomarkers predictive of response to metformin, and define the role of this agent in obesity-driven EC treatment."

 Few therapies have yet to achieve durable remission of advanced stage triple negative breast cancer
(TNBC). One promising approach to improve clinical outcomes is to combine multiple chemotherapies to
stimulate an antitumor response. An underlying premise for this approach is that select chemotherapies enhance
TNBC immunogenicity, thereby stimulating the anti-tumor immune response improving tumor growth control.
 With this strategy in mind, we have discovered that inhibiting the epigenetic regulator BPTF, of the
nucleosome remodeler NURF, either genetically or pharmacologically, is a novel approach for improving TNBC
immunogenicity. In this proposal we now show using two different TNBC tumor models that when BPTF depletion
is combined with the DNA methyl transferase inhibitor (DNMTi) Guadecitabine (Guad) we further stimulate tumor
cell immunogenicity and dramatically improve tumor growth control in immune competent, but not immune
compromised mice. Genome wide analysis shows that the combination therapy enhances immune stimulatory
pathways, with an enrichment for immune stimulatory cytokines. Thus, using a novel combination approach, we
hypothesize that BPTF depletion/inhibition will synergize with immune stimulating therapies targeting epigenetic
factors (Guadecitabine) for TNBC treatment improving therapeutic outcomes.
In Aim1, will identify the immune reactive effector cells required for the antitumor effects of Guad + BPTF
depletion using the mouse E0771 TNBC tumor model. Additional flow cytometry and ex vivo immune cell assays
will characterize and further define the immune cells required for these antitumor activities. The BPTF inhibitor
BZ1 + Guad will be used in parallel tumor studies using the E0771 model to determine if it has in vivo activity,
and in molecular studies (RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq) from FACS sorted E0771 tumor cells to determine if it has
similar effects to that of BPTF KO. Humanized mouse models and TNBC PDX samples will validate the
translatability of these findings. In Aim2, we will optimize the drug-like properties of our second generation lead
BPTF inhibitor. Validating the therapeutic potential for BPTF inhibition has been significantly limited due to a lack
of potent inhibitors for BPTF. Our first generation BPTF bromodomain inhibitor, AU1, while effective for initial
validation of BPTF inhibition in cells, and in vivo, its poor physiochemical properties and modest activity in vivo
have limited further validation of BPTF as a drug target. Using structure-based design we have now developed
a second and highly potent inhibitor series. Here, we focus on optimizing its drug-like properties, using both
established biophysical and cell-based assays to translate our findings to our in vivo model system in Aim 1.
 The completion of these Aims will deepen our understanding of cancer cell epigenetics, and cancer cell
immunogenicity by characterizing the effects of inhibiting the chromatin factor NURF in combination with DNMTi.
Our approach is further designed to enhance antitumor immunity to TNBC by improving therapy induced tumor
immunogenicity through a combination epigenetic therapy."
10816557,"Previous studies have identified three central pathways of parent-to-child anxiety transmission: (1) shared
genetic load, (2) fetal programming through maternal experiences during pregnancy, and (3) parental
behaviors that model and shape anxiety-linked cognitive, behavioral, and emotional profiles. To date, we have
few tractable mechanisms by which we can intervene upon the first two pathways. However, a wide and robust
literature has characterized specific parenting behaviors linked to the emergence of childhood anxiety, making
it a translatable target. Much of this literature has focused on broad profiles based on questionnaire measures
or aggregate summaries of behaviors averaged over time. As a result, we know little regarding the moment-
by-moment interactions that serve as a behavioral conduit for intergenerational transmission. Repeated daily
interactions with caregivers, channeled through dyadic social dynamics, attune the child to parental
expressions of fear and distress influencing the child's own responses to surrounding events. The current
longitudinal study will focus on two instances of dyadic social dynamics as mechanisms for anxiety
transmission. First is dyadic synchrony, a process captured in the temporal co-ordination of discrete microlevel
signals between dyadic partners evident across levels of analysis. Second is emotion modeling, in which
observed patterns of parental emotion, distress, and coping are internalized by the child, supported by
psychophysiological synchrony, and then reflected in their own subsequent behavior. Children ages 4 to 6 and
their parent, including both mothers and fathers, will be assessed at five time points, 6 months apart in a multi-
modal battery. Parent-child dyads will engage in mildly stressful interactions that allow us to capture neural
(fNIRS), psychophysiological (RSA), attentional (mobile eye-tracking), and behavioral (overt emotion and
distress) patterns of synchrony. In addition, we will assess regulatory (EEG delta-beta coupling), cognitive
(ERP N2 component), and attentional (threat bias) markers of socioemotional development and anxiety risk.
Finally, we asses child fearful temperament, which is associated with greater sensitivity to the social
environment and the later emergence of anxiety. Thus, we can ask (1) Concurrently, how do patterns of dyadic
social dynamics vary across parent-child pairs? (2) Across tasks, to what extent does variation in dyadic
patterns help predict anxiety risk? (3) Over time, can we predict socioemotional profiles and anxiety risk from
earlier patterns of dynamic dyadic interactions? Reflecting the Research Domain Criteria, we integrate
multilevel mechanisms by examining how social and arousal/regulatory systems are coupled through dyadic
social dynamics to influence the emergence of anxiety via the cognitive (attention to threat, cognitive control),
arousal/regulatory (delta-beta coupling), and negative valence (fearful temperament) systems. In doing so we
heed the call to examine development and the environment as “bidirectional influences” on transdiagnostic
processes of psychopathology in order to translate our findings to dyadic treatment approaches."
10816558,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The amygdala is one of the brain structures that encode ‘valence’, defined as the subjective value
allocated to sensory stimuli that influences consequential behavior. The central amygdala (CeA) has emerged
as an important brain region for actively processing diverse motivations, including valence-related learning and
behaviors. State-of-the-art techniques in genetics and optogenetics have revealed microcircuits within the CeA
that have heterogeneous functions in appetitive and aversive motivational states, as well as long-range
projections to numerous brain regions whose functions are closely related to both positive and negative
valences. Although significant progress has been made, it remains unclear whether distinct cell types
contribute to behavioral regulation related to a singular valence, positive or negative, or whether some cells
contribute to both in a state-dependent manner. One candidate of single cell type in the CeA processing in
both is the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)-expressing neurons. In negative valence, the role of CeA-CRF
neurons in fear and anxiety has been identified, and they are thought to regulate the fear expression and the
scalability of fear. Interestingly, activation of CeA-CRF neurons was reported as reinforcing, which suggests
that CeA-CRF neurons are also involved in positive valence. A possible way of processing both valences is via
an affective state-dependent manner; where the state is set based on the valence of previous experience.
Accordingly, state-dependent actions of CRF have been previously reported, with the infusion of CRF into the
nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a naïve state being reinforcing; however, with a previous aversive experience,
infusion of CRF into the NAc inverses the appetitive state into an aversive state. Based on these observations,
I propose that the order of two experiences (positive followed by negative or negative followed by
positive) results in a biased state dependence that favors valence coding by CeA-CRF towards the
initial experience. I will examine this hypothesis at three different levels (behavioral, neuronal, and neural
circuit). The proposed research will provide new insights into how different emotional valances are processed
by the same neurons and how this processing affects motivated behaviors. I will receive extensive training in
molecular, genetic, and imaging techniques that will allow me to reveal how CeA-CRF neurons have
bidirectional influences over reward-seeking behavior in a state-dependent manner and to elucidate the
mechanisms underlying these modulations."
10814532,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Regulation of sleep and arousal states is delicately balanced by a network of distinct brain regions. In
patients with narcolepsy, this balance is disrupted, leading to excessive daytime sleepiness, and disrupted
nighttime sleep. Patients with narcolepsy also experience cataplexy: abrupt muscle atonia during waking, often
in response to strong, positive emotions. Despite significant research efforts, it remains unclear what
mechanisms functionally regulate cataplexy. Muscle atonia is regulated by brainstem regions such as the
ventrolateral periaqueductal gray and adjacent lateral pontine tegmentum (vlPAG-LPT), which is directly
innervated by neurons in the limbic system, including the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and central nucleus of the
amygdala (CeA). The NAc and CeA mediate responses to positively valenced stimuli and are densely
innervated by the dopamine system, while the vlPAG-LPT is innervated by neurons in the locus coeruleus, the
primary source of norepinephrine in the brain.
 The goal of this proposal is to clarify how monoaminergic systems and limbic-brainstem projections
promote cataplexy and disrupted sleep in narcolepsy. First, we will characterize the precise temporal dynamics
of dopamine release in the NAc during cataplexy and changes in state, as well as determine if stimulating
dopamine release in the NAc is sufficient to drive cataplexy. Next, we will identify the release dynamics of
norepinephrine in the vlPAG-LPT and determine if increasing noradrenergic tone in the brainstem is sufficient
to alleviate cataplexy propensity. Finally, to elucidate the functional connectivity between the limbic system and
muscle atonia-generating regions, we will record and manipulate neurons in the NAc and CeA that project to
the vlPAG-LPT to evaluate if these projections regulate muscle atonia. We will use a combination of in vivo
fiber photometry and fluorescence-based monoaminergic sensors, Ca2+ recording, circuit-specific opto- and
chemogenetics, and chronic recording of EEG/EMG in freely moving animals to investigate these circuits.
 The proposed research is significant as it will meaningfully contribute to our understanding of the
circuitry underlying narcolepsy symptoms, regulation of arousal states, and establish a relationship between
emotional processing and muscle tone. The proposed research is also innovative as it will utilize state-of-the-
art, multidisciplinary approaches to define the neural underpinnings through which monoaminergic and limbic
systems act to mediate muscle atonia and disrupted sleep. Collectively, this information will significantly
improve our understanding of REM sleep circuitry and narcolepsy, leading to development of more effective
treatments of narcolepsy and other disorders resulting in disrupted sleep and abnormal motor control across
states, such as REM-sleep behavior disorder and obstructive sleep apnea."
10820953,"ABSTRACT
The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) have been implicated in a variety of central nervous system
(CNS) disorders. However, the significant similarity between subtypes has limited the discovery of subtype-
selective nAChR antagonists. As a result, the pharmacological utility of the nAChRs depends on the development
of improved ligands. Recently, several alkaloids isolated from Aristotelia chilensis were identified as nAChR
antagonists that preferentially antagonize the α3β4 subtype over the α4β2 and α7 subtypes. While other α3β4
antagonists exist, they also have poor pharmacokinetic properties and multiple off-target liabilities, making the
subtype-selectivity the Aristotelia alkaloids possess particularly unique. In addition, preliminary competitive
studies indicate that these alkaloids act through an allosteric mechanism of action, in contrast to other
antagonists that are largely orthosteric ligands or channel blockers. Previous studies of the Aristotelia genus
have identified >30 unique alkaloids, but few studies have been conducted on their biological activity. My central
hypothesis is that these understudied Aristotelia alkaloids are also subtype-selective nAChR antagonists that
operate through an allosteric mechanism of action. To investigate this, in Aim 1, I will extract alkaloids from the
leaves of A. chilensis through a novel countercurrent chromatography approach, isolating known natural
products while also potentially discovering novel alkaloids. In a complementary approach, Aim 2 seeks to access
known Aristotelia alkaloids via a series of biomimetic transformations. Armed with a library of alkaloids, Aim 3 will
evaluate their activity at multiple nAChRs through a functional assay. Competitive inhibition studies will be done
to investigate the potential allosteric mechanism of action, while mutagenetic analysis will identify which residues
on the receptors are crucial for activity and reveal differences between subtypes. While making synthetic
advancements, this research is both innovative and significant as it will be the most extensive biological
evaluation of the Aristotelia alkaloids to date, providing tools to probe the nAChRs as a whole, as the alkaloids
establish an entire class of subtype-selective nAChR ligands."

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by the formation of thick mucus in the lung leading to chronic
infection of various pathogens that are prone to developing antibiotic tolerance. Despite effective
modulator therapy (HEMT) that improves lung function and many clinical outcomes, HEMT does
not eliminate chronic, antibiotic-tolerant lung infections, the major cause of morbidity and mortality
in CF. Although most people with CF (pwCF) have multispecies lung infections, almost all
published studies focus on single-species infection models. Thus, polymicrobial-host interactions
in CF are not completely understood, especially under physiologically relevant conditions such as
anoxia typical of mucus plugs.
The overarching goal of our work is to use in vitro models to gain insight into how polymicrobial
infections develop in pwCF. Bacterial pathogens have been shown to secrete membrane vesicles
(bEVs) that diffuse through the CF mucus to deliver virulence factors such as DNA, RNA, and
proteins to their targets. As recent studies have shown that the first exposure to bacterial products
alters DNA methylation and gene silencing that affect subsequent exposures, our hypothesis is
that pwCF develop chronic infections in part due to epigenetic changes caused by preexposure
to CF pathogens that reduce the HBEC immune response to infection over time. This application
aims to characterize the effects of an in vitro model of CF polymicrobial infection on human
bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) with preexposure to bEVs secreted by the common CF pathogen
Staphylococcus aureus. The polymicrobial culture contains four prevalent and abundant CF
pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Prevotella
melanogenica. Using transcriptomic and proteomic analysis, cytokine analysis, ATAC-Seq, and
DNA methylation analysis, this study aims to elucidate the host HBEC response to treatment with
bEVs. This study will contribute to our understanding of host-pathogen interactions in the CF lung
and potentially identify novel therapeutic targets during infection.
This project will provide the applicant with a broad range of both bioinformatic and lab techniques
that will provide a strong foundation for her long-term goal of becoming an academic researcher."

10818157,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Patients with lung cancer, on the most prevalent cancer diagnoses in the United States, tend to experience
debilitating physical and psychological sequelae. Common symptoms include reduced lung function, dyspnea,
fatigue, sleep disturbances, and depression compromising their physical function and quality of life (QOL).
Consequently, patients have a high need for care and support. Patients’ family members are their most important
and valued source of support and care; yet, caregiving is physically and emotionally taxing. In fact, family
caregivers report high rates of psychological distress, fatigue, and sleep disturbances, which may undermine the
quality of care they are able and willing to provide to the patient. Including caregivers in supportive care
interventions may not only reduce caregiver burden but may potentially improve patient outcomes beyond the
typical patient-oriented programs. Thus, there is a need to establish evidence-based dyadic interventions
targeting both patient and caregiver outcomes. To this end, we have systematically built a program of research
testing a patient-caregiver dyadic yoga program to address the needs of this vulnerable population. The parent
R37 project seeks to examine the efficacy of an instructor-led dyadic yoga program regarding improved objective
physical function and QOL outcomes in both patients and caregivers while patients are undergoing standard
thoracic radiotherapy. With the goal to facilitate the large-scale implementation of this promising intervention
with a flexible, cost-effective delivery strategy, we now propose to deliver the intervention on-demand via a
mobile application. Under the proposed R37 extension project, we seek to field test a mobile app prototype and
assess the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of the app-based yoga program in 20 patient-caregiver dyads.
We will examine social determinants of health variables as correlates of these study outcomes to ensure that
the app is acceptable to families from diverse backgrounds. We will use a mixed-methods approach to
understand the experience of participants with the intervention and its delivery using qualitative accounts.
Participant feedback will inform the need to refine and enhance the yoga app. The proposed innovative work will
provide rich pilot data that will inform a subsequent, larger trial seeking to test the effectiveness of the app-based
program in the community setting. Thus, this study represents a compelling next step of this program of research
to support this vulnerable patient-caregiver population. Together, the results of the parent project—a rigorous,
single-blind randomized controlled trial with a stringent comparison group—beautifully dovetail with the
knowledge gained from the proposed pilot trial to inform future implementation research and ultimately, the
clinical care of this high need population."

ABSTRACT
The UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC) Flow Cytometry Shared Resource (FCSR) provides
continuously updated, state-of-the-art instrumentation, expertise, and training at a reduced recharge rate to
JCCC investigators whose research requires flow cytometry, mass cytometry, imaging cytometry, or cell sorting.
The FCSR is one of the longest running core facilities at UCLA and it has been servicing the needs of the JCCC
cancer research community since its inception in 1988. In 2015, Zoran Galic, PhD (ZY) became the FCSR
Director and he oversees all of the operations of the facility. Alejandro Garcia, PhD, FCSR Co-Director and
Facility Manager, is responsible for FCSR daily operations and assists Galic with long-term core planning. The
FCSR currently houses an ImageStream imaging cytometer, a Helios mass cytometer, an Attune NxT flow
cytometer, two LSR II cell analyzers, an LSR Fortessa cell analyzer, three Aria high-speed cell sorters, one of
which is enclosed in a biocontainment hood, and a RoboSep magnetic cell separator. The FCSR also established
a separate office for data analysis with two high-end computer workstations capable of processing large data
sets generated by the ImageStream imaging cytometer. FCSR personnel have >80 years of combined flow
cytometry experience and they provide expert guidance to JCCC investigators through one-on-one
consultations, educational classes, an information-rich website, and “how-to” poster presentations. Workshops,
seminars, and tutorials organized by the FCSR ensure that researchers remain on the leading edge of cytometry.
The FCSR has a broad user base and during 2013 – 2018, the FCSR supported many JCCC investigator projects
from all six JCCC Research Programs. JCCC member usage is 78% of the total Shared Resource usage. FCSR
support activities helped to enable 333 publications, of which 175 (53%) were in high-impact (IF ≥10, or field
leading) journals. FCSR leaders work with the Dean’s office in the David Geffen School of Medicine and
additional centers on campus to contain costs and provide high quality services for JCCC investigator studies.
During the prior project period, the FCSR supported numerous JCCC research teams to advance impactful
preclinical studies to the clinic. One inter-programmatic investigation showed that a combination of an immune
checkpoint inhibitor with BRAF plus MEK signaling pathway inhibitors in a mouse model of BRAF-mutant
melanoma was superior to either treatment alone. Based on these results, two Phase I clinical trials and three
larger industry sponsored randomized trials are underway. Separately, the FCSR supported intra-programmatic
preclinical studies on checkpoint inhibitors and dendritic cell vaccines in a mouse model of intracranial glioma.
Based on this work a randomized, multi-institution trial established that neoadjuvant pembrolizumab significantly
extended patients overall survival compared to a control group that received pembrolizumab only as adjuvant.
In both of these study examples, the FCSR sorted tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and provided the
instrumentation and expert guidance for analysis of these cells and peripheral blood cells.

10823124,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Proper hand washing is a cost-effective intervention that oﬀers powerful protection against a host of gastrointestinal
and respiratory transmissible diseases, but only if done eﬀectively, at the appropriate time, and consistently. Global
campaigns to increase handwashing have raised awareness, but signiﬁcant barriers to improved handwashing
remain. Teachers and parents are not commonly taught proper technique. As a result, despite massive, and costly
installation of handwashing stations and signage, too often children do not use soap or sanitizer eﬀectively—even
with adult supervision. Beyond technique, students struggle to remember when to wash when occasions require it.
Despite years of pandemic, heightened awareness, and sincere eﬀorts by adults and children alike, durable
handwashing habits have not taken hold.
OBJECTIVE: We aim to create an interactive digital trainer that: 1) depicts hand anatomy correctly for more accurate
learning; 2) provides an immersive educational experience, with critical visual feedback of germs remaining, so that
students learn to use the appropriate scrub motion to address specific areas of that hand that were inadequately
cleaned; 3) engages students to play again, over several sessions, to foster habit formation, and durable gains in hand
hygiene.
RESEARCH DESIGN: In Phase I, we successfully created an innovative, engaging, and highly entertaining prototype:
the Bubble Beats handwashing trainer. We established that our technology works on Chromebooks, iOS devices, and
PCs. After a single session with the trainer, students demonstrated a significant increase in World Health Organization
(WHO) hand hygiene steps performed at the sink. In Phase II, we will develop a fully-featured solution, with
supporting material for teachers, and test this product in an independent evaluation across multiple classrooms, in
a randomized controlled trial.
METHODS:
AIM 1: PRODUCTION. Teacher co-developers, domain experts, and students will participate throughout the project
in rapid and frequent cycles of design, build, test, and refine. Early usability testing with small groups will test new
components of the trainer, for eventual integration into the completed product. We will evaluate the effectiveness
of these new components assembled together in authentic classroom settings. Handwashing proficiency will be
measured by photometric analysis of images of hands before and after washing, and video analysis of WHO scrub
steps performed while washing at the sink.
AIM 2: EVALUATION: Finally, a formal and independent evaluation across multiple classrooms will measure short-
and long-term impacts of the training, to determine healthy habit formation for handwashing."

The 6th Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Notch Signaling in Development, Regeneration & Disease (July
14 – July 19, 2024 at Bates College, Maine) will address a major unmet need in the American scientific
community by convening scientists from both academia and industry around a fundamentally important
developmental signaling pathway broadly relevant to health and disease. Although the first “Notch phenotype”
was described over a century ago, studies elucidating the molecular events responsible for Notch signal
transduction have accelerated since the early 1980s after cloning of the Drosophila Notch receptor gene.
Subsequent studies showed that Notch signaling requires cell-cell contact, established that ligand-induced
proteolysis of the Notch receptor produces a transcriptional regulator that stimulates expression of target genes,
and demonstrated that post-translational modifications are critical to modulate ligand-receptor interactions.
Studies in model organisms identified the importance of Notch signaling in numerous cell fate decisions. Human
genetic studies showed that mutations of core Notch pathway components underlie several developmental
syndromes (e.g. Alagille Syndrome, Spondylocostal Dysostosis, aortic valve disease) and adult onset diseases
(e.g. CADASIL, various heart and valve malformations), while causing or contributing to cancer initiation or
progression in a tissue-dependent manner. Beyond its role in specific organ systems, new findings have also
uncovered a role for Notch in immune, inflammatory and metabolic disorders. Notch-targeted antibodies and
pathway inhibitors have entered clinical trials as potential anti-cancer therapeutics and are being considered for
other indications, but effective deployment of Notch modulators in the clinic continues to pose distinct challenges
around efficacy (what tumors or disease states are most likely to respond), and toxicity, because of the
importance of Notch in the homeostasis of selected adult tissues (such as the gut). Building on past success,
this meeting aims to provide a vibrant US forum to stimulate cross disciplinary discussions and collaborations in
this important area of biology, nurture a sense of community among researchers, and welcome new members
into the field. The meeting program will bring together scientists from academia, biotech and the pharmaceutical
industry addressing fundamental mechanistic, developmental, clinical and therapeutic questions using cutting-
edge approaches. Invited participants include a blend of established “thought leaders” with vast institutional
memory and many early career scientists with exciting new findings. The informal and confidential environment
in GRC meetings encourages free scientific exchange of unpublished data. The inclusion and integration of a
Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) exclusively for postdocs and graduate students prior to the GRC is a particular
asset to draw new scientists into the field and encourage trainee participation. Most importantly, the combined
GRC/GRS format excels in integrating students, postdocs and investigators wishing to enter a new field, such
as the study of this important signaling pathway."

 2 The overall goal of this project is to rationally engineer a new genetically expressible lanthanide-based
 3 photostable phosphorescent probe with time-integrated single molecule brightness and high electron density
 4 for Super Resolution Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy (CLEM) to enable elucidation of cellular and
 5 detailed subcellular structures at the pseudoatomic level. Imaging/monitoring single molecules with nanoscale
 6 spatiometric resolution within cells is an essential step for investigating the details of cellular processes. Super-
 7 resolution and electron microscopy techniques can achieve the resolution required for those purposes and to
 8 those ends, fluorescent probes such as fluorescent small molecules, fluorescent proteins (FPs), and quantum
 9 dots (QDs) have become essential tools for research and medical diagnostics.
10 Despite the variety of probes that exist, there is an unmet need for a genetically encoded, dual-modality probe
11 suitable for super-resolution Correlated Light and Electron Microscopy (CLEM). Such a probe would have time-
12 integrated single-molecule brightness necessary for super-resolution light microscopy and be electron dense
13 enough to allow visualization/localization by electron microscopy, especially cryogenic electron tomography
14 (CET). To meet those needs, Photon Biosciences is engineering a novel and innovative enabling bioinspired
15 peptide-based probe that has the time-integrated single-molecule brightness and electron density necessary
16 for super-resolution CLEM. The objective of this Phase I project is to rationally engineer a probe to have ≥25
17 Ln3+-phosphorescent centers, which we hypothesize will have the phosphorescence and electron density
18 necessary to surpass current single-modality CLEM probes and then show the probe’s versatility by using it in

22 our initial peptide probe via rational engineering for high electron density and brightness. Aim 2 is to develop a
23 multimeric probe from its precursor by concatenation and increase its electron density and brightness further.
24 Aim 3 is to demonstrate proof of concept by cryo-luminescence microscopy. Aim 4 is to demonstrate further
25 proof-of-concept by using the probe for probe-guided FIB milling and tomography. Successful completion of
26 this project will result in an electron dense, time-integrated single molecule brightness, genetically expressible
27 dual modality probe for super-resolution CLEM."
10821973,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pregnancy-capable Veterans experience an elevated risk of adverse reproductive health outcomes relative to
the general population due to a high prevalence of comorbid mental, physical, and psychosocial conditions
influenced by trauma, combat exposure, and other experiences. Veterans' unique trauma and stress
experiences may influence the development or severity of other health conditions that pose issues for
reproductive health outcomes and care access, such as autoimmune conditions. Pregnancy, in particular, can
introduce elevated risks for people with autoimmune conditions because many are managed with teratogenic
medications, and pregnancy may exacerbate disease activity. Access to ongoing contraceptive care is
especially vital for people with autoimmune conditions because it allows them to mitigate the potential health
risks of pregnancy and control when they want to achieve pregnancy. These conditions often require regular,
ongoing care from multiple providers, which may lead to gaps in access and quality of wanted contraceptive
care. Subspecialists, who often provide most care for this population, may have limited expertise in
contraception and fear the possible implications of pregnancy for their patients. The underlying elevated risk of
adverse reproductive health outcomes coupled with the unique challenges of autoimmune conditions may be
further compounded by provider and facility-level characteristics for Veterans who use Veterans Health
Administration (VA), where pregnancy-capable Veterans remain a minority and availability and quality of
contraceptive care are variable. The VA is an ideal setting for studying contraceptive care delivery for this
population due to the system’s size, comprehensive electronic health record (EHR), and diverse patient
population. The proposed mixed methods study aims to examine the potential multi-level quality and access
barriers to contraceptive care delivery to Veterans with autoimmune conditions using three different data
sources. First, differences in documented procedural or prescription contraception will be investigated for
Veterans with the most prevalent autoimmune conditions compared to those without these conditions using
structured EHR. Hierarchical modeling will identify facility, provider, and patient-level factors associated with
the documentation of a method. Second, novel natural language processing software and qualitative analytical
methods will be applied to unstructured EHR clinical notes to characterize contraceptive care for Veterans
without a documented method to explore contributors to the lack of documentation, such as poor care quality
or lack of need. Third, the findings from the first aims of the project will be further contextualized by conducting
qualitative interviews with Veterans with autoimmune conditions with and without documentation of
contraception to characterize access and quality barriers to receiving desired contraceptive care. The results
from these aims can provide evidence of potential issues with contraceptive care delivery for Veterans with
autoimmune conditions and offer actionable steps for improving VA policy and practice related to this care."
10809396,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In the United States alone, in thirty years, prevalence rates of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are projected to be at
13.8 million, with familial and societal costs estimated at $800 billion US dollars annually. With limited
treatment options, there has been a renewed focus on targeting neurodegenerative, pathophysiological
processes through behavioral and lifestyle-based interventions in the prodromal phase of AD. Presence of
subjective cognitive decline (SCD)—referring to perceived persistent declines in cognitive functioning
compared with previously normal cognitive status—has been identified as a potential preclinical stage of AD.
Individuals with SCD show steeper declines in cognitive functioning later in life and have a higher rate of
conversion to dementia. Moreover, SCD is also associated with the classical neural signatures of AD.
Additionally, as individuals with SCD, by definition, show no objective indication of cognitive decline but are
known to seek medical advice at memory disorders clinics, they make ideal candidates for prevention
research. In the proposed application, our overall objective is to develop and test the feasibility of an entirely
online, asynchronous mindfulness training program, and an active control group—internet-based Lifestyle
Education (iLifeEd)—for targeting mind-wandering and plasma-based biomarkers of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau
pathology in adults with subjective cognitive decline. Mindfulness meditation involving the cultivation of
purposeful and nonjudgmental attention to specific phenomena as they arise holds significant promise as an
attention training platform. There is increasing support for engagement in mindfulness practices to reduce
mind-wandering and enhance the executive control of attention, partially via mindfulness-induced alterations in
connectivity of the default mode network with other large-scale networks. More recently, mindfulness has also
been linked with higher volumes of the hippocampus, lower levels of amyloid burden and tauopathy in mid-life
and older adults, suggesting a potential link between mindfulness training and AD biomarkers. However,
clinical trials of mindfulness meditation are predominantly in-person, group-based MSBR programs that limit
accessibility, and where online programs have been examined, studies show poor adherence and high attrition
The proposed project is divided into two main objectives, wherein Aim 1 will iteratively develop and refine the
iMBSR and iLifeEd protocols with a team of stakeholders, including psychologists, contemplative scholars,
instructional design specialist, computer programmers, and focus group participants. Aim 2 is a Stage I pilot
study, examining the feasibility of iMBSR and iLifeEd protocols, in an independent sample of 60 adults with
subjective cognitive decline. Our main hypothesis is that iMBSR, carefully curated to include active
components of the MBSR program, and designed to be entirely self-paced and online, will be feasible and
acceptable to adults at higher risk for developing AD and other related dementias."

research through hands-on, mentored research from established, senior scientists; (Aim 2) to increase the
number of postdoctoral trainees who pursue academic careers in research; and (Aim 3) to increase the
number of postdoctoral trainees who successfully compete for extramural funding. The training plan will include
individualized curriculum based on the trainee prior experience, competencies and skills with structured
classwork, seminars and workshops that supplement hands-on research with mentors. Emphasis will be
placed on experiential mentored research experiences as well as professional development activities to
prepare the trainees for a research career in academic medicine. The knowledge and skills learned from this
training program and the other educational and professional development activities promoted by PODIUM will
allow this new cadre of URM investigators to advance the HLBS research. We will conduct a careful and
rigorous evaluation of the program to maintain and enhance its quality. To help strengthen the pathway of
diverse scientists, we propose innovative collaborations where PODIUM trainees will serve as career role
models to predoctoral students in established academic programs, such as Bronx Community Health Leaders
(BxCHL), the Einstein Office of Diversity Enhancement (ODE) programs and Leadership, Engagement, and
Diversity in Education and Residency (LEADER) to increase interest of URM students in academic research
careers. Our ultimate goal is to provide the next generation of URM investigators with the state-of-the art
experiences and skills required to initiate and sustain successful independent careers in HLBS research. This
training program brings our institution's considerable depth, rigorous scientific approach, and tradition of
innovation to bear on important and highly prevalent burden of HLBS disorders in our community."

Fuchs’ endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is an inherited corneal disease leading to blindness. Loss of
corneal endothelial cells and guttae (bumps in Descemet’s membrane) are pathological FECD features. A
deficiency of corneal endothelial cells (CEC) causes corneal opacity due to loss of pumping function. In
developed countries, including the U.S., FECD prevalence is estimated to be 4%. Corneal transplantation is the
only treatment for advanced FECD patients. Although corneal transplantation is highly successful, the shortage
of donor corneas makes pharmacologic therapies for FECD an unmet medical need, yet the lack of animal
models for late-onset FECD (which accounts for a majority of cases) has hampered the development of new
therapies. In this project, we will develop new animal models for late-onset FECD. Recent genomic analyses of
patients’ DNA have demonstrated expansion of (CTG)n trinucleotide repeats in the intron of the TCF4 gene. In
Caucasian populations, nearly 80% of late-onset FECD patients have long (CTG)n (n>30-40) repeats, and the
length of (CTG)n is the most predictable genetic mutation for late-onset FECD. Nevertheless, the mechanism of
how the long (CTG)n repeats lead to FECD is unknown. One hypothesis is that long (CUG)n RNA sequesters
RNA splicing factors that lead to alteration of RNA splicing and malfunction of CECs. The other hypothesis is
that the long (CTG)n repeat induces alteration of TCF4 gene expression that leads to the malfunction of CECs.
From various reports and evidence, we hypothesize that long (CUG)n repeat RNA induces the FECD phenotype
independent of the TCF4 gene. To prove this, we will produce two different FECD mouse models. In Aim 1, we
will overexpress long (CUG)n RNA in the corneal endothelium using (CTG)960 mice. The (CTG)960 mice were
initially developed and used as a model for myotonic dystrophy 1 and express long (CUG)960 trinucleotide RNA
under a tetO (tetracycline operator) promoter using three different strategies. In Aim 2, we will overexpress long
(CUG)n RNA in corneal endothelium exogenously by adenovirus, a model that could be applicable to larger
animals relevant to humans. We will monitor in vivo CEC density using a Rostock microscope and in vivo corneal
thickness by corneal optical coherence tomography for up to 10 months. Also, ex vivo corneas will be used to
evaluate (CUG)n RNA accumulation by in situ hybridization, measurement of CEC density by Alizarin red
staining, and observation of CEC ultrastructure by plasma-focused ion beam scanning electron microscope.
When established, our animal models will be useful not only for therapy development but also for understanding
early events in the development of late-onset FECD, such as guttae formation and alteration of mRNA
expression. These studies will determine the relationship of TCF4 to late-onset FECD, elucidate the pathogenic
mechanisms, and create animal models beneficial for therapeutic development."
10809041,"Project Summary/Abstract
A diagnosis of pediatric cancer is uniquely disquieting for children and adolescents, and the long-term
management of complex treatment protocols, repeated hospitalizations, and unpredictable complications
generates persistent stress, often spanning many years. Stressful early life experiences have enduring
consequences on long-term physical and mental health and may impair emotional processing. How youth
respond to stress is meaningfully linked to ability to regulate emotions and cultivate resilience, which have
important implications for long-range development, including development of a range of internalizing and
externalizing symptoms of psychopathology although resilience emerges as robust protective factor. One way
the brain governs the immune system is via cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone released during stress and in
part responsible for the up- and down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine activity. Executive control is also
often undermined during a stress response. The long-term goal of Dr. Cosgrove's research program is to study
the psychology and biology of how youth with cancer and their families respond to stress in order to identify
those at elevated risk for poor psychosocial and neurocognitive outcomes, in turn informing allocation of
mental health services in pediatric oncology. The specific objective of this NCI K08 Award resubmission
application is to determine whether immune responses to stress induction in youth recently diagnosed with
blood, brain, or other central nervous system cancers predict impairment in emotion regulation, low quality of
life, and neurocognitive (executive control) outcomes at follow-up. We will recruit 70 youth in close proximity
(2-10 months) to diagnosis and study longitudinal relationships between baseline psychobiological stress
vulnerability and psychosocial/neurocognitive outcomes at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. This K08 Award will
provide Dr. Cosgrove with the necessary training and mentorship to: (1) develop expertise in pediatric psycho-
oncology, with a subspecialty emphasis on multidirectional stress-immune-emotion regulation relationships; (2)
understand ways to increase emotion regulation and promote quality of life outcomes in pediatric medical
illnesses; (3) develop expertise in affective science as applied within pediatric oncology, including
measurement of executive control with neurocognitive assessments; (4) study ethical considerations involved
with conducting research in pediatric oncology, a uniquely vulnerable population; (5) advance skills in scientific
writing, including federal/foundation/intramural grants and peer-reviewed scientific manuscripts. To accomplish
these training goals, she has organized a strong mentorship team (Korey Hood, Ph.D.; Matthew Hocking,
Ph.D.; David Spiegel, M.D., Laura Roberts, M.D., M.S.) and advisory committee (Sheri Spunt, M.D., Cynthia
Gerhardt, Ph.D., Holden Maecker, Ph.D., and Christine Blasey, Ph.D.), with expertise in pediatric and adult
psycho-oncology, pediatric psychology and oncology, neurocognitive assessment, biostatistics, and clinical
research with vulnerable populations."

The overall objective of the Tuskegee University Center for Biomedical Research/Research
Centers in Minority Institutions (TU CBR/RCMI) Program is to build upon and expand the
University’s research infrastructure and develop researchers to conduct research related to health
disparities. This initiative is centered around: 1) providing the necessary infrastructure, resources,
services, and technical support to enhance the ability of the University’s researchers to stay on
the cutting-edge of multidisciplinary basic biomedical/clinical health/ and population research
focused on health disparities; 2) supporting the research and career development of post-doctoral
fellows, junior- and mid-level investigators; and 3) enhancing the research excellence by
facilitating the recruitment of competitive and highly expert research scientist. These objectives
are to be achieved primarily through the following aims: 1) Provide pilot-level funding to support
the development and expansion of the research capacity of TU; 2) Provide core research facilities
equipped with the infrastructure, instrumentation, and personnel to support the needs of the TU
research community; 3) Engage the community through RCMI-sponsored activities that include
the research faculty; 4) Expand the clinical health research component in the current initiative;
and 5) Provide mentorship and career guidance to enhance the transition of junior-level
investigators into independent scientists. The overall goal of the CBR/RCMI project (2023-2028)
is to continue the development of its 4 core components, Administrative, Investigator
Development, Research Infrastructure and Community Outreach infrastructure and increase the
numbers and skill proficiency of minority scientists engaged in scientific areas that includes basic
biomedical, clinical health and population research focused on health disparities. The three
scientific areas, basic biomedical, clinical health and population research have research
objectives focused on breast cancer, obesity and cervical cancer, all of which disproportionately
affect African Americans and underrepresented minorities. The goal is to continue support for a
competitive, multidisciplinary collaborative environment that advances these scientific areas of
research. Tuskegee University has distinctive strengths because it is located in the heart of the
Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved, African American population, and it has
a large number of minority faculty members as well as undergraduate and graduate trainees. The
goal of the CBR/RCMI will be accomplished through establishment of three synergistic research
cores, with services to enable investigative research on health inequities among minority groups,
especially African-Americans residing in the ‘Black Belt’ counties of Alabama."

10807421,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Lewy body disease, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and prion disease constitute a group
of neurogenerative diseases called proteinopathies. They are characterized by the accumulation
of aggregated and misfolded proteins in the central nervous system. The identities of the
aggregated disease proteins have been identified but how they work at a mechanistic level and
contribute to disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Moreover, despite having common co-
occurring pathology, little is known about the relationship between these proteinopathies,
complicating potential treatment options. Recent evidence has shown a link between the
mitochondrial-mediated clearance of aggregated proteins and the preservation of neuronal cell
integrity. Likewise, established model systems of proteinopathies have both demonstrated similar
results and carved a way to study the molecular details of these diseases. In this grant, we
propose to the budding yeast S. cerevisiae and mammalian cells including neurons to address
the role of mitochondria and cyclin C in the clearance of the aggregated disease proteins. Of
these proteins TDP-43, has emerged as a key player in AD, ALS, and FTLD. Studies in yeast
have revealed that cyclin C, a conserved member of the Cdk8 kinase module of the mediator
complex, plays a role in TDP-43 toxicity. Our studies point to cyclin C’s known interaction with
mitochondria, contributing to TDP-43 mediated-cell death. In this proposal, we will determine the
molecular details of the relationship between cyclin C and TDP-43, mitochondria, and cell viability
in yeast (Aim 1) and mammalian systems (Aim 2). Together these studies should provide insight
into the role cyclin C plays in proteinopathies."

This is an application for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) to support
the academic career development of the applicant. The candidate's long-term goal is to become an
independent clinical investigator and leader in the theoretical understanding, treatment, and intervention of
hazardous drinking and anxiety among Latinx persons. The applicant has conducted research on
transdiagnostic processes (predominantly anxiety sensitivity) and their association to health behavior research
(predominately focused on smoking) among non-Latinx White individuals. More recently, the applicant has
engaged in research focused on alcohol use among Latinx individuals as well as minority stress as it relates to
smoking behaviors among Latinx persons. Thus, the applicant proposes to build on her past and more recent
research experience, as well as her clinical training, in mental health and follows a logical, but novel,
progression from prior research and training experiences to development of a new area of expertise in the
design and evaluation of alcohol- and anxiety-related processes among Latinx persons who may be impacted
by minority-related stressors. Mentorship will be provided by a group of exemplar senior investigators and will
foster the candidate's development in this new area of research. The applicant proposes a comprehensive
training plan that includes development in five areas: (1) theoretical and empirical knowledge relevant to
minority stress models in the context of hazardous drinking and anxiety among Latinx adults, (2) advanced
longitudinal research design through Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA), (3) experiential avoidance
(EA) as a transdiagnostic mechanism, (4) advanced analytic training, and (5) advanced research skills in
research dissemination, leadership, and grantsmanship. Through this funding mechanism, the candidate’s
proposed study aims to: (1) examine the influence of microaggressions (MAs) – brief, subtle forms of everyday
discrimination due to racial/ethnic status – on alcohol use motivation and hazardous drinking, (2) examine the
influence of MAs on anxiety experience, (3) explore the mechanisms underlying these relations by evaluating
the indirect effects of MAs on alcohol- and anxiety-related processes via EA, and (4) explore moderators of
alcohol- and anxiety-related processes, including cultural-specific constructs (e.g., ethnic identity, familisimo,
acculturative stress among 200 Latinx adults who are hazardous drinkers. Moreover, we seek to elucidate if
MAs are distinct from, and more impactful than, non-discriminatory daily stressors and overt racism on the
proposed outcomes. This proposal is conceptualized as a prototypical example of translational research that
can explicate mechanisms from a multi-method framework to enhance our understanding of complex minority
stress and hazardous drinking and anxiety relations and serve as a catalyst for future work in this emerging
domain among a health disparities group. The knowledge and experience gained from this proposal will equip
the candidate with a unique set of skills to advance knowledge in this important but understudied area."
10933533,"The long-term goal of this project is to gain an understanding of the circuit mechanisms underlying circadian
dysfunction and associated behavioral disturbances in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer’s disease
related dementias (ADRD). AD/ADRD are associated with progressive disruption of circadian rhythms,
including body temperature, locomotor activity, and other rhythms, compared to healthy aged-matched
controls. This suggests that AD-related pathology alters the ability of the master circadian pacemaker (the
suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, SCN), to synchronize such rhythms to the daily light-dark cycle.
A particular form of circadian dysfunction in around 20% of AD/ADRD patients is “sundowning”, characterized
by agitation, aggression, and wandering during the late afternoon and early evening. The neurobiology of
sundowning remains unknown, but our lab has developed a working model for how disruption of circadian
pathways in mice may lead to temporal disturbances relevant to sundowning. The SCN is known to regulate
body temperature and locomotor activity rhythms by a pathway through its major postsynaptic target, the
subparaventricular zone (SPZ). We recently showed that aggression propensity in mice also follows a daily
rhythm regulated by the SCN and SPZ through a separate downstream pathway. Importantly, disrupting this
pathway increases aggression around the active-to-rest phase transition, which is temporally analogous to
when sundowning patients show agitation and aggression. AD-associated disruptions to the SCN, SPZ, or their
input pathways, may thus lead to disturbances in body temperature, locomotor activity (in the form of
wandering), and also sundowning-related aggression. To address potential mechanistic connections between
AD-related pathology and circadian function, we conducted behavioral and neuroanatomical analyses in the
TAPP mouse model of AD. We identified the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPB) in the brainstem as a major
site of pTau, found that the LPB projects to both the SCN and SPZ, and reveal strong evidence of a role for
LPB pTau in AD-related circadian dysfunction and aggression. Here, we will test our hypotheses that the
LPBàSCN/SPZ pathway is required for normal circadian function and that pTau in this pathway underlies AD-
related circadian dysfunction and sundowning-related behavioral disturbances. We will use retrograde delivery
of Cre recombinase from the SCN and SPZ, and Cre-dependent vectors in the LPB to specifically manipulate
LPBàSCN/SPZ neurons. We will determine if chemogenetic manipulations of LPBàSCN/SPZ neurons acutely
ameliorate or exacerbate circadian dysfunction and increased aggression in TAPP mice. We will also express
the P301L mutation (and subsequently pTau) in only LPBàSCN/SPZ neurons in wild-type mice and in mice with
high levels of a-beta to examine interactions between pTau and a-beta in this pathway. Finally, we will use
Cre-mouse lines to target specific LPB subpopulations that differentially project to the circadian system to
determine their respective roles in normal circadian function and pTau-related circadian dysfunction."

Spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) is a gastrointestinal complication affecting 3-8% of extremely low birth
weight infants, corresponding to approximately 4,000 prematurely born babies annually in the US. All affected
infants require surgery and are at an increased risk of brain injury, infection, and death. Yet, the pathogenesis
and etiology of SIP are poorly understood. Consequently, there are currently no biomarkers for early recognition
or disease-specific therapy. The foundation for this proposal is preliminary and published data where we showed
alterations in T cell and epithelial cell subsets in SIP-affected mucosa that was not present in non-SIP mucosal
samples. Intestinal immune dysregulation in SIP was characterized by reduced tissue-resident memory T cells,
increased naïve T cells that produce more IFNγ upon stimulation, and a decreased proportion of epithelial cells
in SIP compared to fetal and neonatal controls. This suggests that the inability to generate tissue-resident
memory T cells in utero and the proinflammatory effects of the naïve T cells that infiltrate the intestine in their
place after birth could contribute to the development of SIP. We hypothesize that susceptibility to intestinal
perforation in extremely premature infants is exacerbated by defects in memory T cell generation and
concomitant epithelial cell damage. We will perform a comparative analysis of T cells’ transcriptome and spatial
location in patients with SIP compared to samples from fetal and neonatal mucosa. Using a T cell co-culture
organoid model, we will investigate the impact of aberrant T cell activation and IFNγ exposure on epithelial cells
in healthy and affected mucosa. Completing these aims will provide data to inform a next-step large-scale study
into the role of epithelial-immune dysfunction in SIP.
 The candidate is committed to a career in studying epithelial-immune cell interactions using spontaneous
intestinal perforation as a model and is strongly supported by her mentors and her department at the Yale School
of Medicine. The proposal builds upon the candidate’s prior research and clinical experience in immune
dysregulation in neonatal intestinal disease. It integrates two new domains of expertise in epithelial-immune
interactions using organoids and integrative network analysis in a comprehensive training and didactic plan. This
proposal is supported by dedicated and experienced mentors with expertise in mucosal immunology,
immunobiology, T-cell signaling in immune disorders, neonatal nutrition, and biostatistics. The proposed
experiments and didactics will provide the candidate with interdisciplinary skills that will foster her transition to
independence as a physician-scientist in studying epithelial-immune cell interactions in intestinal disorders in
children."
10810712,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing metabolic disorder that is closely associated with
obesity and insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes. NAFLD begins with a simple hepatic steatosis, which in some
individuals may progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), an advanced abnormity that may further lead
to fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure or cancer. Whereas enhanced de novo lipogenesis and fatty acid influx initiate
the hepatic steatosis, hepatic inflammation triggers the transition from hepatic steatosis to NASH and is an
important driving force of the pathological progression towards fibrogenesis. However, the exact mechanisms
underlying the development and progression of NAFLD remain poorly understood. While numerous studies
have been devoted to the evaluation of genetic factors involved in obesity and its associated complications such
as NAFLD, much is unknown about epigenetic changes in this process. Epigenetic regulation, including histone
acetylation, is a molecular link between environmental factors (e.g., diets) and complex diseases (e.g., NAFLD).
Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) acts to remove acetyl groups from lysine residues in histones, thereby
inhibiting gene expression. Our preliminary data suggested that liver-specific deletion of HDAC1 decreased
hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis in mice. Therefore, we hypothesize that HDAC1 plays a
central role in the development of NAFLD. Aim 1 will determine the role of HDAC1 in promoting hepatic
steatosis. We have generated genetic models with liver specific deletion or overexpression of HDAC1. We will
determine: 1) whether and how liver-specific deletion of HDAC1 prevents, whereas specific overexpression of
HDAC1 promotes hepatic steatosis in mice; 2) whether down-regulation of the transcriptional repressor KLF3
mediates the effect of HDAC1 in promoting hepatic lipid storage via regulation of PPARγ. Aim 2 will determine
the role of HDAC1 in promoting hepatic inflammation in the development of NASH. Hepatic inflammation triggers
the transition from hepatic steatosis to NASH. We will determine: 1) whether liver-specific deletion of HDAC1
prevents, whereas specific overexpression of HDAC1 promotes NASH in mice; 2) whether down-regulation of
the transcriptional repressor KLF3 mediates the effect of HDAC1 in promoting hepatic chemotaxis and
inflammation via regulation of C-Jun. Aim 3 will determine the mechanism underlying regulation of HDAC1 by
excess nutrients. O-GlcNAcylation has emerged as a key nutrient sensor that regulates cellular metabolic
pathways in response to over-nutritional cues. We will determine whether HDAC1 O-GlcNAcylation by excess
nutrients such as glucose and saturated fatty acids, levels of which are commonly elevated in obesity, increases
HDAC1 protein stability by preventing ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, leading to enhanced HDAC1
protein content and activity. This project will define the role of HDAC1 as a nutrient sensor that regulates hepatic
lipid metabolism and inflammation in the development and progression of NFALD. Our studies could guide the
development of the epigenetic regulation as new therapeutic targets in the treatment of NAFLD."
10810714,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly all sensory signals enter the neocortex by way of the thalamus, and the sensory cortex, in turn, distributes
this information to several downstream cortical and subcortical areas. A prominent but often neglected feature
of the sensory cortex is numerous feedback projections from other cortical areas. This key organizational feature
of the brain implies that the ongoing activities in other cortical regions may influence local information processing
and the outputs of the sensory cortex. Indeed, corticocortical communication is thought to mediate cognitive
processes such as attention, prediction, expectation, and awareness. Communication problems between cortical
areas are also associated with certain neuropsychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia.
Despite its obvious importance, a thorough understanding of how cortical feedback activity influences sensory
processing has been elusive. The central goal of this investigation is to determine how long-range cortical
feedback projections influence cortical sensory processing at the level of cellular, synaptic, and circuit
mechanisms. We address this goal in three specific aims using the mouse sensorimotor system, a leading model
for studying forebrain circuits and active sensation. Aim 1 will focus on the connections between the motor cortex
and layer 2/3 of the somatosensory cortex. Using specific Cre-expressing mouse lines and optogenetics, we will
test the hypothesis that motor feedback engages two parallel but dynamically distinct systems of inhibition in
layer 2/3 of the somatosensory cortex. Aim 2 will focus on infragranular layers, which contained a mixed
population of excitatory projection neurons. Using both isolated and intact brain preparations, we will test the
hypothesis that the dynamic balance of excitation and inhibition caused by motor cortex activity is dramatically
different across deep-layer projection neurons depending on their cortical and subcortical projection target. Aim
3 will use optogenetics to unravel the inhibitory circuits mediating motor integration in layer 5/6 of the
somatosensory cortex. This project will provide much-needed insight into how cortical feedback systems
influence sensory processing. Such information will be essential for understanding neuropsychiatric disorders
involving feedback communication."

The World Health Organization announced a marked increase in patients with diabetes; from 108
million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014. Diabetes causes severe complications including blindness,
heart attacks and lower limb amputation with an estimated 1.5 million deaths annually caused by
diabetes. Therefore, there is growing interest in identifying novel drug targets and alternative
therapeutics approaches. Estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) is a nuclear hormone receptor that
regulate gene expressions related to anti-inflammatory activities, oxidative phosphorylation,
biogenesis and fatty acid metabolism. Large body of data suggest ERRα as a promising therapeutic
target in treating metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The
identification of ERRα selective small molecule agonists would be valuable chemical probes and
pharmacological tools to further explore the role of ERRα in diabetes. However, existing ERRα
agonists lack in vivo potency and selectivity that are required for their use as chemical probes. In
addition, there are no X-ray crystal structures available for ERRα bound agonists, which hindered
the discovery of specific ERRα agonists. Understanding the molecular basis of agonist ligand
binding to ERRα is crucial for identification and optimization of novel potent and specific agonists.
Initial preliminary studies using molecular dynamics simulations, revealed the presence of novel
alternate binding site in ERRα. Targeting this alternate site holds premise for discovery of novel
ERRα agonists. We propose two specific aims to be done in two phases: 1) Investigation of the
mechanism of agonist ligand binding to ERRα orthosteric and allosteric sites using a combination of
computational and experimental approaches. This step is essential to characterize low energy state
structural ensembles favouring agonist binding to ERRα. 2) Implementation of computer-based drug
design approaches such as structure-based virtual screening for discovery of new molecular
scaffolds that bind and selectively activate ERRα. These aims will provide novel, first in class ligands
that selectively activate ERRα and can be used as chemical probes for investigation of their role in
diabetes in future grant proposals."

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with Lewy Body pathology that can lead
to progressive cognitive decline and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD), a form of Lewy Body Dementia.
Cognitive dysfunction in PD is common, affecting up to 80% of persons with PD (PwP) over the disease course.
PD-associated cognitive decline has devastating consequences, including quality of life impairment, increase in
caregiver burden, loss of independence and productivity, and increased risk of institutionalization. This results
in significant public health and societal burden. Pharmacologic treatments for cognitive dysfunction in PD are
often ineffective and none prevent progression to PDD. Exercise has promise for improving cognition in PD, but
the best exercise prescription for individual PwP is unknown. Slow wave sleep (SWS) is important for cognitive
function due to its involvement in synaptic plasticity, cortical reorganization, and glymphatic function. The PI’s
preliminary data show that SWS is important for cognitive performance in PwP. Further, the PI found that
exercise increases SWS in PD and only PwP with increased SWS had improvement in executive function. This
interindividual response heterogeneity provides an opportunity to tailor exercise prescriptions to individual PwP.
The hypothesis is that exercise will improve cognitive function in PD and that changes in SWS will serve as a
biomarker and mediator of rehabilitation-induced cognitive response. Our exploratory hypothesis is that
efficiency of glymphatic function may underlie these effects.
Using an innovative Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design, the PI will test these
hypotheses in a randomized, controlled trial of 120 PwP to investigate 1) the effects of exercise rehabilitation
versus delayed-exercise control on cognition in PwP (Aim 1); 2) determine if changes in SWS due to exercise
mediate the exercise-induced changes in executive function in PwP (Aim 2); and 3) determine if glymphatic
function predicts exercise-induced changes in cognition (Exploratory Aim).
Study design: In the first phase of the trial, participants will be randomized to 12-weeks of progressive resistance
training rehabilitation (PRT) or delayed-exercise control (1:1). Arm assignment in the 2nd 12-week phase of the
trial will be determined by individual response in the first 12 weeks. Specifically, responders (those with increases
in SWS) will continue PRT for the 2nd 12 weeks of the trial while non-responders (no sufficient increase in SWS)
will transition to endurance training (ET) for the 2nd 12 weeks. After the 1st 12 weeks of the trial, participants in
the delayed-exercise group will perform PRT for the 2nd 12 weeks of the trial. The study addresses priority areas
of NCMRR by investigating 1) an objective marker (SWS) that may predict individual rehabilitation treatment
response and 2) treatment for secondary conditions (cognitive impairment) associated with physical impairment
(Parkinson’s disease)."
10810717,"Project Summary:
 My lab is interested in defining how the maternal load is established during oogenesis and decoded
after fertilization. We know the identity of most important maternal transcripts and maternally supplied RNA-
binding proteins. We know that these factors are required for germline development, oocyte maturation, and
pattern formation in early embryogenesis. But we do not yet know which regulatory events are most important
for reproduction, or what mechanisms coordinate regulation in space and time.
 We employed a “protein-centric” approach to map the wiring diagram of maternal RNA regulation in the
nematode Caenorhabidits elegans. We defined the sequence motifs recognized by a several maternal RNA-
binding proteins (RBPs) and identified of functional cis-regulatory elements in 3’UTR reporter genes
representing well studied maternal mRNAs. Our work made revealed that binding specificity is not sufficient to
explain mRNA targeting in vivo. All proteins studied to date bind to short linear partially degenerate motifs
present in at least 30-50% of all mRNAs. In some cases, the motifs have been shown to be necessary but not
sufficient to drive regulatory activity. In other cases, the motifs do not lead to regulation. Putting a motif, even in
multiple copies, into a transgene does not confer RBP-dependent regulation. Binding is not a great predictor of
regulation, revealing that binding site context is also crucial for targeting.
 Moving forward, we are pursuing three major strategies. In the first, we are using CRISPR-cas9
genome editing to make mutations in the 3’UTRs of two critical maternal transcripts in order to identify which
regulatory events are most important to define the pattern of expression and for reproductive health. Genome
editing technology has advanced to the point where we can make targeted UTR deletions and substitutions, so
now we can assess importance directly. Our second direction is aimed at defining regulatory mechanisms. We
are performing AID-degron tagged experiments to define how RBPs and core regulatory machinery control the
maternal mRNA expression with temporal resolution in the germline and in the embryo. Finally, we wish to
understand how the biochemical properties of an RBP contribute to its mutant phenotypes. Proteins can have
multiple activities, and it is not always clear that the most obvious activity is the one that underlies its mutant
phenotypes. We are in position to address this question directly. We have expressed and purified several C.

10800122,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is the second most common adult muscular dystrophy in the
world with a global prevalence of ~4:100,000. Clinically, patients with FSHD experience progressive
weakness, muscle wasting, and varied symptomatic burden. As adult patients with FSHD age, they frequently
develop difficulty walking or lose the ability to ambulate due to profound weakness and muscle atrophy.
Currently, there are no therapies that have been demonstrated to reverse or even slow the progressive
symptoms associated with FSHD. A treatment that limits disease progression and/or reverses functional
decline would be beneficial to this population. In 2022, we successfully completed a single center (University
of Rochester), single-arm, proof-of-concept study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of daily rHGH
(Genotropin®) combined with testosterone enanthate injections every 2 weeks in men with FSHD. Participants
received study drugs for 24 weeks followed by a 12-week washout period. Participants received serial safety
testing, laboratory testing, functional assessments, and disease burden monitoring during the study with no
participants experiencing a serious adverse event. After 24 weeks, the six-minute walk distance increased by
37.3 meters (p=0.001), lean body mass improved by 2.2 kg (p<0.0001), body fat reduced by 1.3 kg (p=0.044),
overall strength (standardized QMT, average % of predicted normal) increased by 3% (p=0.033), clinical
function (FSHD-COM) improved by 12% (2.4 points; p=0.006), and total disease burden (FSHD-HI) reduced by
19% (6 points; p=0.043) from baseline. While this approach generated one of the largest gains of function in
response to a therapy in FSHD, a larger placebo-controlled efficacy study is needed to further validate these
results. The proposed one-year planning award allows for the completion of all of the preliminary steps
needed to successfully initiate and eventually conduct such a study. Planning award activities will include but
will not be limited to: 1) finalizing the study protocol, statistical analysis plan, data and safety monitoring plan,
and all required study materials; 2) securing pharmaceutical contracts for study drugs; 3) identifying and
securing partnerships with external collaborators and clinical sites; 3) initiating the IRB approval process; and,
4) applying for a NIAMS U01 clinical trial award to support the implementation and conduct of a multicenter
phase 3 study. Ultimately, this phase 3 study will evaluate an extremely promising therapeutic approach for
improving ambulation, strength, lean body mass, and symptomatic burden in a well-defined cohort of patients
with FSHD and will pave the way for FDA approval of a potentially life-improving therapy for patients with this
muscular dystrophy."
10809454,"Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels, and represent the
leading cause of death worldwide, taking more lives than all forms of cancer combined. An estimated ~18
million people die from CVDs annually, representing 31% of all global deaths, making it a leading cause of
death for both men and women. Clinical studies have revealed significant disparities between women and men
in the incidence of, and mortality from, CVDs. CVDs develops 7 to 10 years later in women than in men but is
still the major cause of death in women. Since 1984, overall mortality from CVDs has remained higher in
women than men. For far too long, cardiovascular disease was considered a “man’s illness”, and women have
been under-represented for years as subjects in all phases of cardiovascular research, from basic science to
clinical application. Because men and women are biologically and physiologically distinct, often suffer
differently from the same diseases, and respond differently to the drugs, there is an urgent need for
improvement in the current preventive, diagnostic, and treatment strategies by considering sex-specific
differences in the etiology and risk factors of CVDs. As an example, recent advances in organ-on-a-chip
platforms have enabled the recapitulation of both physiological and pathological conditions of complex tissues
and organs in vitro, including those of the heart. However, none of these models ever truly considered sex as
an important biological variable. The goal of this bold new methods R21 project is to reveal sex differences in
an engineered microfluidic cardiac hypertrophy-on-a-chip platform, populated with sex-specific cardiac cells. It
is hypothesized that there exist critical differences between sexes in the development of biomechanically
induced and/or biochemically induced cardiac hypertrophy in the biomimetic on-chip platform. Sex as an
important biological variable in heart-on-a-chip systems has not been investigated so far and we envision our
high-risk, high-reward project to lay down the basis for future in-depth investigations on this indispensable but
highly underrepresented parameter."
10810983,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In the United States, nearly one in five older youth struggles with basic reading skills (NCES; PIAAC, 2019).
Because of their low literacy levels, these individuals are placed at greater risk for unemployment and poor health
outcomes compared to their typically developing peers (Miller, McCardle, & Hernandez, 2010). These struggles
with reading may be due to a brain-based difficulty in learning new words, which is a critical skill for reading and
language development (Perfetti, 2007). We have previously reported behavioral evidence that children and youth
with reading disabilities experience difficulties learning and remembering phonologically similar spoken
pseudowords (e.g., pibu in relation to pibo or dibu; Malins et al., 2020), which can be taken as evidence of
unstable phonological representations for newly learned words (Magnuson et al., 2011). Despite these previous
behavioral findings, we do not yet understand how language-related networks in the brain contribute to these
observed word learning difficulties, especially in older youth who have struggled with reading for many years.
The objective of this proposal is to use non-invasive brain stimulation (i.e., repetitive transcranial magnetic
stimulation, or rTMS) to evaluate a causal model of word learning and processing, thereby providing a better
understanding of its underlying neural mechanisms. In the proposed study, using a within-subjects design,
participants will complete a visual phonological discrimination task and spoken artificial lexicon learning and, as
well as a novel word retention task following application of rTMS (either active stimulation or sham) to a dorsal
stream node of the reading network in the brain. Participants will consist of two groups of learners between the
ages of 16 and 21: 20 older youth with typically developed reading abilities (OYTD), and 20 older youth with
reading difficulties (OYRD). We hypothesize that: (1) inhibition of the left dorsal stream will impact subsequent
learning, processing, and retention of phonologically similar pseudowords; (2) the impact of dorsal stream
inhibition on word learning behavior will be associated with baseline levels of variability in neural activity
(Hancock, Pugh, & Hoeft, 2017). For the OYTD group (Aim 1), we predict that dorsal stream inhibition will result
in slower phonological processing, slower growth in word learning accuracy, and poorer retention, specifically
for phonologically related pseudowords. In contrast, for the OYRD group (Aim 2), we predict that dorsal stream
inhibition will result in faster phonological processing and growth in word learning accuracy, as well as improved
retention specifically for phonologically related pseudowords. To better understand the nature of these effects,
we will perform exploratory analyses (Aim 3) to evaluate associations between baseline neural activation
variability during a functional magnetic resonance imaging task and individual differences in the magnitude of
modulatory effects observed in Aims 1 and 2. Completion of these aims will lay a foundation for future proposals
that will use rTMS as an adjunct to improving learning potential during treatment for persistent reading difficulties."
10814783,"Amyloid diseases involve conformational changes and aggregation of normally soluble peptides and proteins.
As these proteins change begin to misfold and aggregate they pass through a toxic soluble oligomer stage and
then they ultimately form insoluble fibrils. We have spent many years characterizing the early events in this
progression, and have observed a common structure form among multiple amyloid-associated peptides and
proteins despite distinct primary and tertiary structure. The structure we “discovered”, which we call α-sheet,
while rare in normal proteins, has been observed experimentally, and short stretches of α-strand are present in
the Protein Data Bank. We embarked on an endeavor to design and evaluate small peptides with complementary structures, also α-sheets, and their ability to inhibit amyloid formation in these systems. These de novo designed peptides inhibit the aggregation of multiple unrelated amyloid systems, indicating that we are targeting a generic structure. When immobilized, these designs also selectively bind the toxic oligomeric forms of these amyloid proteins over the monomers or fibrils. Here we propose to extend these studies by investigating whether α-sheet forms during amyloidogenesis of Abeta variants associated with Alzheimer's disease. The effects of targeting the toxic oligomers with de novo α-sheet designs will then be evaluated in vitro, in neuroblastoma cells, and in different, more biologically relevant systems."

The purpose of the CRNA Imaging Core is to provide CRNA investigators with access to cutting edge imaging
approaches and expertise in both light microscopy and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The Core will
collaborate with CRNA investigators to use high-resolution light microscopy to localize and track HIV-1 RNA-
protein complexes in their cellular context and to use single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to
determine structures of RNAs, RNA-protein complexes, and HIV-related protein complexes. The Core will work
to bridge the resolution gap between the two approaches by integrating live cell and superresolution light
microscopy approaches, facilitated by the rapidly improving methods in cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). The
overall goal is to be able to determine 3D structures of HIV RNA-protein complexes both in vitro and in their
cellular context. The Core lab is co-led by two PIs. The component at the University of Michigan is focused on
cryo-EM and is directed by PI Melanie Ohi. The lab at the University of Wisconsin, run by PI Nathan Sherer, will

career goal is to become an independent clinical investigator who uses implementation science to promote the
adoption and integration of evidence-based Chronic Disease Self-Management programs for persons with
chronic disease, primarily opioid use disorder (OUD) and serious mental illness (SMI). This K01 will support
four key areas of career development: 1) intervention adaptation as it relates to the mental health and primary
care needs of persons with OUD; 2) training in clinical trial design and management in real-world settings; 3)
advanced skills for qualitatively evaluating intervention implementation; and 4) strengthening research
leadership with a focus on gender equity and diversity in science. Dr. Siantz has assembled an interdisciplinary
mentoring team comprised of Adam Gordon, MD (Primary Mentor), who is an expert dissemination and
implementation (D&I) researcher focused on improving quality of care to vulnerable patient populations with
OUD; and Leopoldo Cabassa, PhD, MSW (co-mentor), an expert mixed-methods D&I researcher focused on
promoting the physical health of persons with SMI. Additional advisors include: Gerald Cochran, PhD, MSW, a
clinical trialist with OUD expertise; Lawrence Palinkas, PhD, an expert in mixed-method designs for D&I
research; Angela Presson, PhD, an expert in clinical trials statistical analyses; and Angela Fagerlin, PhD, an
expert in patient decision support interventions and in gender equity and diversity in research leadership.
 People with OUD have a high co-occurrence of serious mental illness (SMI) and other chronic
diseases, and are often challenged by their clinical symptoms and social vulnerabilities. While primary care
settings frequently treat patients with OUD and SMI, primary care providers have few tools to support this
population in self-managing these complex health conditions. Chronic Disease Self-Management programs
(CDSMPs) can improve disease management skills and behaviors, but have not been adapted for primary care
patients with OUD and SMI. Un-adapted versions might lack relevance to this population and setting. Dr.
Siantz will address this implementation gap. This research will support a future hybrid-effectiveness study to
test the adapted CDSMP for primary care patients with OUD and SMI. This study’s Specific Aims include: 1)
Adapt the CDSMP for adults with OUD and SMI for implementation in a primary care setting using the
Collaborative Intervention Planning Framework; 2) Test the feasibility, acceptability, and initial impact of the
adapted CDSMP for persons with SMI and OUD in a primary care setting; and 3) Evaluate implementation
process and context of the adapted CDSMP using Rapid Assessment Method Informed Clinical Ethnography.
This proposed research is significant because it will develop a health education resource for a population at
high risk for early mortality. The proposed research is innovative because it will extend an existing CDSMP to a
new patient population (persons with OUD and SMI) and novel setting (primary care)."
10932395,"Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) rates have risen markedly over the past 15 years, becoming the most
common indication for liver transplantation in the U.S. and generating the majority of healthcare and cost
burden among all liver diseases. With the COVID pandemic, these trends have worsened, and it is estimated
that, if nothing is done to stem the tide, ALD-related mortality will double by 2040. Despite decades of medical
research, alcohol cessation remains the only intervention that substantially decreases long-term ALD morbidity
and mortality. However, only 10-15% of ALD patients access alcohol use treatment in the first year after their
diagnosis, with women even less likely to access treatment compared to men. Despite these gaps, surprisingly
few behavioral interventions for alcohol cessation have been tested in ALD patients, and, of those that have
been tested, integrated alcohol cessation treatment alongside medical and hepatology care has had the most
impact at reducing alcohol use. To address these critical research gaps, the investigators will perform a
randomized, controlled, Type 1 hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial in a population of ALD patients to
evaluate the effectiveness of CHESS Health Connections (a smartphone app for alcohol cessation shown to
significantly reduce risky drinking in a prior randomized clinical trial of patients with severe alcohol use
disorder). Patients will be enrolled in both general hepatology and multidisciplinary ALD clinics (which include
integrated alcohol use treatment professionals alongside hepatology providers) at two large tertiary care
centers (University of Wisconsin and University of Michigan). Aim 1 will compare the effectiveness of CHESS
plus usual care (n=180) versus usual care (n=181) on days of abstinence over 6 months. Aim 2 will assess
implementation of CHESS through qualitative interviews of key patient, provider, and clinic-level stakeholders
using the Replicating Effective Programs framework and implementation costs. Our secondary/exploratory
analyses will examine intervention effects on health outcomes including depression, anxiety, insomnia, AUD
treatment engagement, and liver health. We will examine key moderators (age, sex, rurality, presence of
formal AUD treatment, and stage of ALD) and mediators (relatedness, competence, autonomous motivation)
on outcomes. We will also examine the impact of the CHESS app on measures of chronic liver impairment
using the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease-Sodium score. This study will build on over a decade of work in
adapting and using CHESS in various populations with alcohol use disorder. This study is highly innovative in
three ways: 1) it is the first fully powered effectiveness trial of a proven smartphone app for alcohol cessation in
ALD patients, 2) it will test a new model of care for delivering alcohol cessation treatment to ALD patients, and
3) it will utilize a novel collaboration of systems engineering and medical researchers with expertise in ALD,
digital health, and implementation science. If successful, this study holds promise to provide critically needed
alcohol use resources to ALD patients and potentially set a new standard of care."
10819360,"Project Summary / Abstract
Cancer cells that enter the brain are difficult to treat with standard intravenous administration of
chemotherapies due to the blood-brain barrier. Intrathecal administration of Methotrexate,
Topotecan, and other chemotherapies have been used in the past to overcome the brain-blood
barrier (BBB) and enhance the dose delivered to the subarachnoid space, though results in poor
tissue distribution and tissue penetration is often not that deep into the tissue.
To address this, EnClear created a platform technology to access the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
and deliver therapeutic agents controlling the circulating dosed CSF between the lumbar
subarachnoid space and the lateral cerebral ventricles. This enhanced delivery is intended to
control dose delivery throughout the cerebrospinal space to target areas of interest. In contrast,
passive intrathecal delivery relies on the natural circulation of CSF to deliver the chemotherapy
throughout the subarachnoid space. With the rapid turnover of CSF (4-5 times in humans), the
drug is cleared quickly with passive diffusion in the CSF. The purpose of this Phase 1 grant is to
demonstrate the safety and feasibility of optimal delivery of Topotecan in a large animal model.
In pursuing the aims of this grant, we will 1) Further develop and optimize a preclinical CSF
extracorporeal flow system for subarachnoid chemotherapy delivery; 2) Test the preclinical
system in a bench-top flow loop and; and 3) Demonstrate the feasibility and safety with our
sensor array of the EnClear preclinical delivery system in a minipig glioma tumor model with
Topotecan treatment. In Phase 2, we will develop the final device, bring it through design
verification, expand the animal efficacy cancer model, perform a GLP animal safety study and
prepare the necessary testing for an Investigational Device Exemption application to FDA to
perform a first-in-human study."
10823351,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Scaffold-mediated exogenous cells transplantation and growth factors/hormones delivery are
two widely-studied alternatives to conventional autologous grafts, the ""gold standard."" For
therapeutic translation, however, both approaches encounter various barriers, including safety
concerns. Compared to use of exogenous cells/proteins, strategies that promote tissue
regeneration by leveraging endogenous cells/signals in situ are more intriguing. Nonetheless,
changes in tissue associated with aging (iron accumulation and chronic inflammation) challenge
bone regeneration and repair, particularly in older populations. Emerging evidence suggests
that the hypoxia-induced factor-1α (HIF-1α) signaling pathway is a central driver of regeneration
and angiogenesis. Findings also show sustained activation of HIF-1α by an iron chelator (e.g.,
Deferoxamine, DFO) is a promising strategy to improve the capacity of regeneration in aged
bones where HIF-1α is markedly inhibited by elevated iron levels. Preliminary work by the Sun
lab has found that another small molecule, phenamil, shows strong anti-inflammatory ability in
addition to playing a powerful role in promoting bone formation by targeting BMP signaling. A
locally and sustained drug delivery system and a bio-mimicking scaffold are critical for
successful translational application of these promising small molecular drugs. The primary goal
of this study is to develop an innovative translational tissue engineering strategy to improve
aged large bone regeneration by rejuvenating endogenous signals and reparative cells. Our
central hypothesis is that novel bio-mimicking 3D nanofibrous (NF) scaffold-mediated dual-
release of small molecules, DFO and phenamil, can improve critical-sized bone defect repair in
aged mice through locally: (1) scavenging for detrimental aged-related factors, i.e., excessive
iron and inflammatory cytokines; and (2) activating HIF1α and BMP signaling pathways, thereby
promoting production of endogenous angiogenic and osteogenic factors, and recruitment of
reparative cells (e.g., MSCs, endothelial cells) in situ, for bone regeneration with a primary focus
on non-load-bearing bone defects. In Aim 1, we will develop novel, biomimetic 3D NF scaffolds,
using our innovative technique of thermally induced nanofiber self-agglomeration (TISA). In Aim
2, we will develop the dual-release system of DFO and phenamil from a 3D NF scaffold to
modulate both angiogenesis and osteogenesis in aged cells in vitro. In Aim 3, we will investigate
the contribution of local and controlled release of DFO and phenamil from scaffolds for critical-
sized cranial bone defect repair in aged mice. The success of this project will establish a novel
strategy for challenged bone repair by improving endogenous tissue regeneration."
10821907,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Concurrent increase in life expectancy and the prevalence of age-related metabolic diseases
highlights how the biology of aging and metabolic dysfunction are intertwined. Dietary restriction
(DR) promotes healthy aging and disease resistance through the manipulation of canonical
nutrient sensing pathways, like TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex I) signaling. However,
manipulation of such critical metabolic pathways results in pleiotropic effects, making it critical to
understand their distinct downstream mechanisms. Previous studies in C. elegans suggest a
critical role for the spliceosome component REPO-1 (reverse polarity 1) in modulating lipid
accumulation and longevity downstream of DR and TORC1 specifically. Knockdown of REPO-1
causes an increase in lipid accumulation in genetic models of DR and reduced TORC1 signaling.
We have identified specific lipid species such as the C18:1 fatty acid as targets of REPO-1
modulation. Additionally, REPO-1 binds pod-2 (polarity and osmotic sensitivity defect 1) Pre-
mRNA and pod-2 is similarly and specifically required for DR and TORC1 lifespan extension.
Further, knockdown of pod-2 phenotypically mimics knockdown of repo-1 causing increased lipid
accumulation. However, it remains to be determined whether this constitutes a causal pathway.
Therefore, the overarching aim of this proposal is to uncover the contribution of pre-mRNA
splicing and lipid metabolism in TORC1 lifespan extension. My central hypothesis is that
REPO-1 regulates TORC1 lifespan extension by modulating alternative splicing and specific lipid
species through POD-2. In aim 1, we will use Crispr/Cas9 mediated tagging of endogenous
REPO-1 to assess tissue-specific effects of REPO-1 on alternative splicing, modulation of lipid
accumulation and longevity downstream of TORC1 signaling. In aim 2, we will achieve tissue-
specific degradation of POD-2 to determine the tissue where it modulates longevity and fat
reserves in TORC1 signaling. We will also define the changes to the lipidome of TORC1 regulated
by POD-2, compare them to REPO-1 dependent changes, and test their contribution to longevity.
Altogether this work will broaden our mechanistic understanding of RNA homeostasis as a
novel paradigm of aging and physiology and expand our knowledge of target pathways to
promote healthy aging."

10821730,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Current treatments for asthma are largely aimed at reducing the incidence of exacerbations with inhaled drugs
that inhibit general inflammation, e.g., corticosteroids. While successful in a subset of patients, asthma
exacerbations remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in those with more severe disease and can
result in airway injury, lung function decline and death. Exacerbations in more severe asthmatics are of particular
concern, as health care costs and lost productivity account for $21 billion/year in US annual health care
expenditures. Thus, there is a critical need to develop new therapies to be used in the treatment of asthma.
Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2) is a G-protein-coupled receptor activated by serine proteases released
from asthma-inducing allergens (e.g., German cockroach, dust mites and the fungus Alternaria alternata), as
well as by mast cell tryptase, human airway trypsin, membrane bound TMPRSS2 and neutrophil elastase.
Activation of PAR2 via allergens or endogenous agonists results in complex cellular signaling (β-arrestin and
Gq/Ca2+) that contribute to the physiological response. Using genetically modified animals, we have shown that
PAR2/β-arrestin signaling can lead to detrimental outcomes (e.g., cytokine production, eosinophil/neutrophil
infiltration, epithelial hyperplasia, mucus secretion and airway hyperresponsiveness) while PAR2/Gq-Ca2+
pathways can be beneficial (e.g., broncho-relaxation). Our decade-long ligand-identification program has
resulted in some of the most potent and selective PAR2 agonists and antagonists, including a full PAR2
antagonist (C391), and a β-arrestin/elastase selective antagonist (C781) that is a promising candidate for
targeting only the detrimental effects of PAR2 in the airway.
PARMedics has completed an STTR Phase I that has proven the feasibility of C781 as an asthma protectant.
C781 blocks PAR2 activation both in vitro and in vivo by trypsin and elastase, and specifically blocks β-arrestin-
2 recruitment and ERK1/2 activation, with no effect on calcium mobilization. C781 represents the first β-
arrestin/ERK1/2-biased PAR2 antagonist and reduces Th1 and Th2 inflammatory responses as well as multiple
measures of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). We propose that C781 may be effective for combating acute
allergen-induced asthma exacerbations, as well reducing pathology in those with moderate to severe disease
and, by reducing the cytokine production and cellular infiltration associated with chronic disease.
In this SBIR Phase II project, PARMedics will optimize the production and aerosolized formulation of C781. C781
will be used to perform pivotal IND-enabling pre-clinical studies to evaluate its in vitro toxicology,
pharmacokinetics and dose-range establishment using two preclinical animal models (Sprague-Dawley rats and
Beagle dogs). Efficacy of inhaled C781 will also be assessed in two preclinical models (humanized PAR2 mice
and dogs). The completion of this project will support a Phase IIb application complete inhalation IND-enabling
toxicity studies. This will allow the filling of an investigational new drug filling (IND) enabling future clinical trials."
10808492,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, commonly called lupus) are at high risk for cardiovascular
disease (CVD), a leading cause of death in lupus patients. Perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) abuts the blood
vessels and can play a protective or pathogenic role in vascular disease. Interestingly, lupus patients have a
higher amount and density (a marker of inflammation) of PVAT surrounding the thoracic aorta as compared to
healthy control subjects. However, the biology of PVAT, and its role in regulating vascular disease in lupus, have
not been investigated. Using a lupus-prone mouse model, we demonstrate for the first time that active lupus
promotes dysfunctional, inflamed thoracic PVAT, as evidenced by increased immune cell infiltration, reduced
expression of adipogenic differentiation markers, adventitial hyperplasia, and a conversion from a brown-like
(protective) to a white-like (pathogenic) phenotype in the thoracic aorta. Dysfunctional PVAT, in turn, impairs
endothelium-dependent relaxation of the thoracic aorta of murine lupus. Moreover, we demonstrate that PVAT
from lupus mice directly impaired endothelial function and promoted wire-induced neointima formation locally
when transplanted to wild-type mice. These intriguing data suggest that PVAT acts as a critical driver of lupus-
associated vascular disease. Mechanistically, single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) and flow cytometry
studies showed that active lupus dynamically modified the composition of PVAT by decreasing brown adipocytes
and markedly increasing T cells, the most dominant of which were CD8+ T cells producing the proinflammatory
cytokine interferon gamma (IFNγ), implying a potential role in dysfunctional PVAT in murine lupus. In this
proposal, we will test the following hypotheses: 1) Active lupus promotes phenotypic switching of perivascular
adipocytes into a trans-differentiated, proinflammatory phenotype; 2) IFNγ producing CD8+ T cells inhibit
adipogenic differentiation and promote PVAT inflammation in lupus; 3) pharmacologically targeting IFNγ
improves endothelial function and neointima formation in murine lupus. These studies will lead to better
understanding of the mechanistic role of dysfunctional PVAT in lupus and provide novel insights into, and
potential therapeutic interventions for, CVD in the context of lupus, which will also shape the focus of my future
independent lab. Hong Shi, MD, an assistant professor at Augusta University, will conduct this project as part of
5-year career development plan, dedicating 75% of her time to research, while her clinical effort will be focused
on caring for lupus patients. Dr. Shi is mentored by Dr. Neal Weintraub (expert in CVD and PVAT) and Dr.

10791988,"Recurrent de novo missense mutations affecting a particular arginine codon (R230) in the KCNQ3 gene are responsible for an electroclinical syndrome that accounts for as many as 1 in 1,000 individuals with intellectual disability and autism. KCNQ3 encodes a voltage-gated potassium channel that is active at subthreshold potentials and concentrated at the axon initial segment, where it opposes depolarizing currents that drive neurons to fire action potentials. We recently reported that R230 variants cause gain-of-function (GoF) effects in an in vitro heterologous system, suggesting that KCNQ3 may be an effective therapeutic target for this disorder. Indeed, as current standard of care is limited to symptom management, the development of effective disease modifying therapy for KCNQ3 GoF Neurodevelopmental Disorder (NDD) represents a critical unmet need. We hypothesize that inhibiting KCNQ3 in the central nervous system (CNS) will provide effective treatment for KCNQ3 GoF NDD. Thus, our long-term goal is to develop therapeutic approaches for the KCNQ3 GoF NDD through inhibition of KCNQ3. We intend to accomplish this goal by reducing expression of KCNQ3 with RNAi, using a gene therapy approach in which KCNQ3-targeted microRNAs (termed miKCNQ3) are delivered to the CNS by adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV). Our study will leverage two different novel mouse models of KCNQ3 GoF NDD. These models are based on two different human disease alleles of KCNQ3 GoF NDD and display shared electroclinical phenotypes (absence seizures and lowered threshold for convulsive seizures) that parallel the human condition and provide robust outcome measures for use in preclinical studies. Preliminary data offers proof-of-principle for this strategy, but our first-generation system is not optimized for clinical use. We believe that optimization of our vector for efficacy and safety at an early pre-clinical stage will provide the most straightforward path forward towards translational application. In this proposal, we will refine our approach with the goals of enhancing safety and specificity of the system. To do this, in the R61 phase, we will develop novel miKCNQ3 expression systems to restrict expression to the target tissue (neuronal populations) and inhibit KCNQ3 without causing toxicity. Upon completion of the R61 phase, we expect to prepare and characterize our lead therapeutic AAV.miKCNQ3 agents, characterize AAV.miKCNQ3 tissue tropism, and estimate sample sizes for use in the R33 phase of the proposal. The goal of the R33 phase is to test the in vivo safety and efficacy of our vectors developed in the R61 phase. To demonstrate efficacy, we will determine the ability of our new KCNQ3-targeted AAV vectors to inhibit KCNQ3 and the electroclinical phenotypes associated with KCNQ3 GoF in vivo leveraging two novel Kcnq3 knock-in mouse models, bearing R231H (Frankel lab) and R231C (Tzingounis lab), representing two different human KCNQ3 GoF NDD disease allele orthologues. Concerns related to off- target effects will also be addressed. Upon completion of the R33 phase of this proposal, we expect to produce data that will support further translation of this strategy toward our end goal of clinical application."

The non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) spectrum is now the most common cause of liver diseases, and
responsible for the biggest proportion of liver transplants. The liver is a central hub that coordinately regulates
the metabolism of many nutrients, including lipids. The liver is not designed for long-term storage lipids, instead
acting as a distributor of lipids with high short-term storage capacity. Long-term lipid accumulation in the liver, in
the form of triglycerides causes steatosis which can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), both of
which are part of the NAFLD spectrum. Identification of the molecular mechanisms of pathways that control lipid
metabolism, both systemic and liver specific are essential for the discovery of disease-preventing therapeutic
targets. Bile acids are both signaling molecules and detergents that facilitate lipid absorption in the gut. While
much has been studied in recent years about bile acid signaling, the role of bile acids as detergents that facilitate
the absorption of different fatty acids has been less well studied. We recently showed activation of the bile acid
receptor FXR reduces liver lipid accumulation in part due to lowering of bile acid-mediated lipid absorption. To
determine how bile acids alter the absorption of different fatty acids, we have developed and validated a novel
AAV-CRISPR strategy to disrupt specific bile acid metabolism genes exclusively in the liver. Using these tools,
we show that specific modulations in the total amount and/or composition of bile acids has profound effects on
liver steatosis. To measure lipid absorption quantitatively and accurately, we have established a non-invasive
mass spectrometry-based approach to measure the absorption of different dietary fatty acids in the intestine in
vivo. We have also developed complimentary imaging modalities to visualize lipids in the intestine. Using these
assays, we have shown that modulating bile acids dramatically reduces lipid absorption but retain preferential
absorption of polyunsaturated fatty acids. These changes contrast with inhibition of lipases in the gut (using
Orlistat) which reduced the absorption of all fatty acids. Here, we have designed two specific aims utilizing a
combination of in vivo and in vitro systems to test the hypothesis targeting bile acids results in specific and
beneficial changes in lipid absorption that are protective against NAFLD or are pathogenic and drive liver fibrosis.
Completion of these studies will further the understanding of the role of bile acids as detergents, implicate bile
acid metabolism as an important contributor in the pathogenesis of NAFLD/NASH, and potentially establish new
therapeutic strategies to target NAFLD."

There were 229 million cases of malaria in 2019, leading to 409,000 deaths; effective vaccines
are a global health priority. Animal models capable of prefiguring the human immune response
are a vital component of the preclinical testing of vaccines. The major goal of this proposal is to
apply the Batista lab's technical innovations in the rapid generation of mice with B cells bearing
human B cell receptors (BCRs) to create new platforms for malaria immunogen screening and
development. Vaccines targeting the infectious sporozoite stage could inhibit the establishment
of clinical malaria, and sporozoite surfaces are densely covered by circumsporozoite protein
(CSP); the most advanced current vaccines in human trials display regions of this protein, and we
intend to use our mouse platforms to improve their targeting. For Aim 1, we will use our existing
mouse model, which expresses the inferred germline version of a potent monoclonal antibody
(mAb) currently in clinical trials, CIS43. Using an immunofocused approach, presenting a
conserved junctional epitope between the N-terminus and the central repeat region of CSP, we
have not only recapitulated the ontogeny of this potent mAb, but have also elicited variant
antibodies that are even more effective in malaria challenge experiments. We intend to deep mine
this effective platform with immunizations by variable-length junctional epitope peptides to 1)
identify the most promising candidate junctional epitope immunogens for inclusion in vaccine
design and 2) identify protective matured antibodies with potential clinical utility. In our models, B
cells bearing humanized BCRs are titrated to low levels to mimic human physiological conditions.
For Aim 2, we will use the CSP full-length and partial probes we have developed for characterizing
our mouse models, in tandem with single-cell sequencing, to explore the frequencies of precursor
B cells in humans. We will use these numbers to improve the precision of our mouse platform,
titrating the humanized cells to more exactingly accurate levels. Finally, in Aim 3, we will take this
immunofocusing approach to other regions of the CSP protein by creating a new series of mice
expressing the precursor sequences of human antibodies to other subdomains of CSP. We will
use this mouse platform to study the immunogenicity of peptides consisting of various sections of
the CSP protein, with the goal of identifying the ideal epitope, or combination of epitopes, to elicit
robust immune responses. We will enhance our models by moving multiple strains of KI B cells
to the same host to try immunogens against “mini-repertoires” of humanized B cells. By creating
these new precision platforms for malaria, we intend to cut the time needed to validate potential
vaccine candidates."
10794331,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
High-throughput and low-cost synthesis of long DNA fragments could open up new frontiers in genomics and synthetic biology by facilitating the production of genes, genetic pathways, variant libraries, or entire synthetic genomes. Microarray printing technologies provide for high-throughput and low-cost synthesis of short oligonucleotides (currently up to 300 bases long), while new technologies, such as enzymatic synthesis, have the potential to synthesize longer sequences. Libraries of open reading frames or regulatory elements have also been constructed. However, assembly of the above or other DNA elements into longer fragments remains a challenge. Widely-used in vitro DNA assembly methods, such as Gibson assembly and polymerase chain assembly, require considerable hands-on time, are difficult to multiplex and scale, and have size constraints on the length of the assembled product. In addition, accurate long assemblies from de novo synthesized DNA are difficult to achieve without a high-throughput error correction step. To overcome these hurdles, we have developed a novel, multiplexed method to parse, sequence verify, and stitch together DNA of various sizes in vivo. Using this method, complex pools of array-synthesized oligonucleotides or other DNA elements can be turned into positionally-ordered cellular arrays, with each position containing a sequence-verified input DNA. Input DNA in these arrays can then be stitched together recursively by bacterial mating. A key feature of our technology is early error detection, whereby individual DNA inputs are sequence-verified prior to stitching. That is, errors that occur during short DNA synthesis are detected and removed, rather than propagated into longer assemblies. At maximal throughput, we estimate that our technology has the potential to produce thousands of DNA assemblies in parallel at a cost that is at least an order of magnitude cheaper than commercially available gene synthesis technologies. Because DNA stitching can occur within bacterial artificial chromosomes, in vivo DNA parsing and stitching can perform multiplexed assembly of DNA constructs exceeding 100kb, at least an order of magnitude longer than current in vitro assembly techniques. In vivo assembly uses a stepwise stitching process that can be branched, allowing the construction of a wide variety of variants at low incremental cost. Here, we propose to continue development of this technology i) by building many genes to learn the error modalities of the process, ii) by assembling a ~100kb product, and iii) by developing a multi-step assembly procedure to reduce assembly time and increase product accuracy. Together, this integrated set of aims will result in a new high-throughput DNA assembly platform capable of synthesizing long and complex DNA constructs and variant libraries at low cost."
10794332,"Project Summary: Our research program investigates reaction mechanisms in asymmetric
organocatalysis and palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reactions. We utilize 13C and 2H kinetic isotope
effects (KIEs) in combination with theoretical calculations as design tools to evaluate fine details of the
transition state (TS) of the rate-determining step (RDS) under unmodified reaction conditions. Our
studies in the area of asymmetric organocatalysis (2013-present) have resolved long-standing debates,
uncovered novel mechanistic pathways, and probed origins of enantioselectivity in a wide variety of
reaction types. In 2018, NIH funding enabled us to expand our research program to the study of
palladium catalyzed cross-coupling reactions – an area of catalysis that is central to medicinal
chemistry. We have discovered that the magnitude of 13C KIE is highly sensitive to minor changes in
the carbon-palladium distance at the TS of the RDS – allowing us to distinguish between competing
pathways and probe the ligand environment at the metal center, all under catalytic conditions. Finally,
we have developed a novel methodology that utilizes symmetric reactants to obtain this information at a
fraction of the time and effort of traditional KIE approaches.
 This MIRA proposal seeks to further expand our research program to include new modes of
catalysis at the frontier of modern-day organic synthesis: (a) palladium catalyzed C-H bond-activation
and functionalization, and (b) nickel metallophotoredox catalysis. Over the next five years, our goal is to
establish our combined experimental and theoretical approach as the state-of-the-art to gain atomistic
understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of these reactions. We chose these two areas to
expand our research program for two reasons – (a) new reaction discovery has far outpaced
mechanistic understanding of these reactions, and (b) our discoveries in palladium catalyzed cross-
coupling chemistry strongly indicate that our approach is ideally suited to resolve key mechanistic
questions in these contemporary areas of catalysis.
 The overall vision of our research program is to develop probes that can rapidly evaluate the
mechanism of catalytic reactions. We seek to change the paradigm that rigorous mechanistic
understanding follows new reaction discovery. We envision that the high-resolution mechanistic insight
that is delivered by our studies will inspire the discovery of new and more robust catalytic methods that
will enable organic synthesis."

The lives of adults with serious mental illness (SMI) are cut short by decades. Chronic illnesses including heart
disease are a fundamental cause. Adults with SMI have high cardiometabolic risk compared to the general
population. Modifiable risk factors (e.g., physical inactivity, poor fitness) are more prevalent and manifest earlier
in the lifecourse in those with SMI. Physical activity (PA) can reduce cardiometabolic risk in SMI populations.
Yet, persons with SMI are significantly less likely to meet PA recommendations. Certified peer specialists
(CPSs), trained persons with lived mental health recovery experience, are a rapidly growing mental health
workforce sector reimbursed by Medicare. CPSs include PA among their wellness goals and offer a sustainable
delivery mechanism for PA interventions within mental health services. Yet, effective PA treatment delivery and
sustainability remain challenging. Innovative, scalable, evidence-based PA interventions for people with
SMI are needed. Parks are free, ubiquitous spaces for PA. Parks offer physical, psychological, and social
benefits linked with improved health behaviors and outcomes. Studies, including ours, have related park access
and use to greater PA, social support, mood, and quality of life (QOL), and less obesity, stress, morbidity and
mortality. 2-37 Outdoor PA is associated with increased enjoyment, satisfaction, and long-term PA adherence, 33
supporting its use for behavior change, especially among those with SMI. Despite park-based PA benefits,34 few
park-based interventions have been tested rigorously. None have focused on SMI populations. Our long-term
goal is to maximize the reach and clinical impact of evidence-based PA interventions to reduce
cardiometabolic risk among SMI populations through use of existing mental health services and
community parks. The PARCS Study is an evidence-based park PA intervention incorporating CPSs in adults
with SMI. Adapted from previous exercise protocols, and grounded in Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) the PARCS
Study will test a 12-week park-based PA intervention (60 min CPS-led, 3 days/week) vs a active control, as part
of current peer group services. The aims of this proposal are: 1) To test the feasibility and acceptability of the
park-based PA intervention incorporating CPSs in adults with SMI (primary), 2a) to assess the effectiveness of
the intervention on SCT mechanisms of action (PA self-efficacy, goal setting, and PA social support, and 2b) to
test the preliminary effectiveness of the intervention on minutes of PA, and fitness in adults with SMI (secondary).
This novel approach aims to establish a sustainable, scalable, and reimbursable intervention model by
leveraging existing resources (CPS services, parks) to reduce cardiometabolic risk in adults with SMI.
Exploratory measures include percent body fat, waist circumference, QOL, and depressive symptoms. Our team
committed team of interdisciplinary co-investigators and community behavioral health facilities has expertise and
resources to achieve the goals of the proposed study. Working with mental health services, we will refine our
approach and generate evidence for future large-scale effectiveness testing."
10794335,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Annually, traumatic injuries affect roughly 3 million people in the US and account for over $650B in costs.
Many patients are resilient and recover well emotionally, but over 20% (~600,000 people per year) develop
mental health problems such as posttraumatic stress disorder and depression, both major risk factors for social
and occupational impairment; poor physical health and quality of life; and lost productivity, work, and financial
resources. Most trauma centers do not address the mental health recovery of patients after a traumatic injury.
This gap in the quality of patient care, combined with unique barriers to mental health services that traumatic
injury patients face, necessitates a cost-effective intervention that meets the needs of these patients at each
stage of the recovery process. We will test the Trauma Resilience and Recovery Program (TRRP), a scalable,
sustainable technology-enhanced intervention to support the mental health recovery of patients who have
experienced a traumatic injury. The model includes education, risk screening, and brief intervention at the
bedside (Step 1); symptom self-monitoring and continued education via a daily text messaging system (Step
2); mental health screening at 30 days via chatbot or telephone (Step 3); and, when appropriate, mental health
treatment referrals (Step 4). Our previous work has provided strong support for the acceptability and feasibility
of TRRP: (1) 98% of patients approached at Step 1 by TRRP staff at the bedside enroll in mental health follow-
up, (2) more than 2 in 3 patients enroll in the symptom self-monitoring system (Step 2), and (3) 75% of patients
who screen positive for PTSD or depression at the 30-day call (Step 3) accept treatment referrals (Step 4).
TRRP staff has provided mental health follow-up to over 8,000 patients to date, only about 400 of whom would
have received mental health follow-up services under usual-care conditions based on the results of our needs
assessment. We are implementing TRRP in 12 trauma centers in the Carolinas, 4 of which already have fully
implemented it. This experience has informed the approach we propose to use in partnership with George
Washington University (GWU) hospital. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial with 1-year follow up of
TRRP vs. enhanced usual care with 350 patients at GWU, which serves a diverse population of ~2000
traumatic injury patients per year (15% penetrating mechanism). Engagement in mental health services and
clinical and functional outcomes will be assessed 3, 6, and 12 months post-baseline by trained interviewers
blind to study condition. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with 20 TRRP patients who have experienced
violent trauma as well as 15 African American and 15 Latinx patients who have experienced non-violent
trauma. These data will inform improvements to the TRRP model as well as the implementation process in
preparation for a future hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial with 8 trauma centers. This body of work is
critical to informing the field as it continues to move toward national standards and recommendations."
10807290,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This NCI K08 Mentored Career Development Award will prepare Dr. Daniel Richardson to become an
independent R01-level investigator in patient-centered cancer care delivery for patients with acute myeloid
leukemia (AML). AML treatment paradigms are changing for older patients. After almost 40 years without any
new treatments, 10 new therapies have been approved since 2017. These approvals have introduced clinical
equipoise into treatment decision-making for many older patients. Choosing the “best” treatment option often
depends on what each patient values most: optimizing quality of life or prolonging survival. Clinicians and
patients can engage in shared decision-making to clarify patient values and help patients arrive at informed
preferences about therapy. Multiple stakeholders have called for the development of new tools to support
patients and clinicians in this complicated process. Dr. Richardson plans to work under the guidance of his
mentors to evaluate a novel values elicitation tool called “PRIME” (Preference Reporting to Improve
Management and Experience). PRIME generates a personalized values report in real-time to inform shared
decision-making based on best-worst scaling (BWS), a simple yet robust values clarification method. This
proposal builds on Dr. Richardson’s previous research with his mentors to develop values elicitation surveys
for AML patients. The objective of this proposal is to evaluate the feasibility of using PRIME to improve
treatment decisions and optimize its implementation for a RCT to evaluate efficacy. The aims of this study are
(1) to determine the feasibility of using PRIME to improve treatment decision-making and (2) to identify barriers
and facilitators of implementing PRIME into clinical workflows to inform development of appropriate
implementation strategies. Success in this project will advance innovative, rigorous methods to capture patient
values that may have broad applicability across oncology. This project will also promote Dr. Richardson’s long-
term research goal of improving the integration of patient values into treatment decision-making. Dr.
Richardson is supported by a mentorship team with expertise in values elicitation (John Bridges, PhD),
implementation science (Stephanie Wheeler, PhD), and cancer care delivery trials (Ethan Basch, MD, Antonia
Bennett, PhD). As part of this K08 award, he will develop expertise in cancer care delivery trial design and
execution, values elicitation methodology, and implementation science."
10807611,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major public health crisis. It is estimated that in 2022, 6.5 million Americans ages 65 or older lived with AD, and 5 million among the same population had mild cognitive impairment (MCI). By 2025, the number of AD cases will reach 7.2 million. The healthcare costs for individuals with Alzheimer’s or other dementias are substantial. The total payments in 2022 for all individuals with AD or other dementias were estimated to be $321 billion; by 2050, the annual payments for AD healthcare will total almost $1 trillion. However, resources are limited, particularly for underserved populations, and identification of cognitive impairment is often delayed so long that more effective treatments are underutilized. Therefore, expert panels have continued to stress the need for validated, brief, case-finding cognitive assessment tools, especially self-administered tests that allow for completely unsupervised administration and can accurately identify those with MCI. However, adding to the difficulties of AD diagnosis during the MCI stage are the significant disparities in the prevalence of AD and access to healthcare in racial/ethnic minority groups and other under-resourced and/or underserved populations. Black and Hispanic individuals are disproportionately more likely than White individuals to have AD, yet their socioeconomic disadvantages impede the early detection of MCI or AD. Thus, having easy access to low/no-cost validated and accurate self-administered cognitive assessments that can be taken in any clinic or non-clinic setting is highly consequential for the early detection of cognitive impairment. The goal of this project is to leverage the electronic Self-Administered Gerocognitive Examination (eSAGE), the metadata collected during eSAGE test-taking, the rich EHR data, and advanced ML techniques to develop such tools, which are particularly accessible to all individuals, including those socioeconomic disadvantaged, AD-vulnerable populations. To achieve the goal, we have three Aims. Aim 1 is to develop behavioral data and metadata, and ML methods to enhance the scoring and predictive ability of eSAGE. Aim 2 is to combine eSAGE test data and metadata/behavioral data with EHR data and develop new ML approaches to increase predictive capacity for cognitive status detection. Aim 3 is to test and validate the new ML- and EHR-enhanced eSAGE with the OSU Wexner Medical Center Memory Disorders Clinic, and with the underserved rural and minority populations in Ohio through outreach and tele-health (tele-cog) to evaluate their cognitive complaints. Successful completion of this project will produce a novel, translational, ML-enhanced eSAGE smart app and its integration within EHR systems, to improve our understanding of behavioral and clinical characteristics of cognition impairment, facilitate the identification of cognition impairment, and ultimately have a translational impact on AD identification and management. The project will enable a widely accessible, easy-to-use, and highly accurate cognitive assessment tool to be available for underserved, AD-vulnerable populations."
10808679,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has a complex genetic architecture including multiple rare variants of large effect,
some of which are also associated with schizophrenia (SCZ). This genetic heterogeneity mirrors phenotypic
heterogeneity, as core ASD behaviors of social impairment and restricted/repetitive behavior differ in severity and
presentation across individuals. Further complicating the phenotype, ASD is associated with impairment across
the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Cognitive Systems domain and co-occurring psychopathology. This limits
effective care. Preliminary work I and others have conducted shows the value of a “genetics-first” approach to
addressing this problem, but few studies have examined rare copy number (CNVs) and single gene variants
(SNVs and indels) associated with both ASD and SCZ. This proposal capitalizes on the Simons Powering Autism
Research for Knowledge (SPARK) cohort, with genetic data available for more than 50,000 autistic people, to
evaluate cognitive systems and psychopathology in autistic people who carry rare variants with shared SCZ risk.
Variants shared by ASD and SCZ have the potential to identify one or more subgroups within ASD. SCZ is
defined by psychosis but, like ASD, is associated with social difficulties. It is also associated with RDoC Cognitive
Systems impairment within the cognitive control and perceptual inference constructs. These constructs are
heritable and associated with specific neural circuits, and they can be computationally modeled. In SCZ,
cognitive control deficits are marked and associated with disorder severity, and perceptual inference deficits
involve strongly weighted prior expectations of sensory evidence that may contribute to psychosis, in which
expectation distorts perceived reality. In ASD, studies do not support a characteristic profile of impairment in
cognitive control, but rather a variable impairment in executive function. Perceptual inference in ASD has been
hypothesized to involve weakly weighted prior expectations, giving rise to stereotyped behaviors and resistance
to change, but studies have variously shown weak, strong, or unchanged weighting of priors. This K23 proposal
tests the overall hypothesis that autistic people who carry genetic variants associated with both ASD and SCZ
(ASD+SCZ variants) define a “SCZ-like” subgroup with impaired cognitive control; stronger perceptual bias
towards prior expectations; and a greater burden of co-occurring psychopathology, with these effects 1)
moderated by contributions from common variation and type of rare variant and 2) worsening over time. I will
remotely assess cognition and psychopathology in 400 participants with ASD (200 with ASD+SCZ variants, 200
without) at two timepoints across multiple levels of analysis, including task paradigms, self-report, and parent-
report. This study represents a unique opportunity to examine connections among genes, cognitive
endophenotypes, and psychopathology in a genetically constrained ASD sample, opening opportunities for later
studies of underlying circuits and emerging endophenotypes as diagnostic predictors across development."
10808764,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 At least 1 in 4 adults with hypertension also has depression. The rate of depression is even higher among
African American adults compared to white adults with hypertension. Depression is associated with worse blood
pressure control, poorer adherence to antihypertensive medications, and ultimately poorer cardiovascular
disease outcomes. Thus, treating depression has great potential to improve hypertension outcomes and address
cardiovascular disease disparities among African Americans. An important limitation of available evidence-based
interventions is that they are not adapted for the context in which they are implemented, thereby reducing their
effectiveness and reach.
 This project proposes to: 1) use health informatics to characterize the contextual factors that influence
depression, hypertension, and their association among African Americans on the South Side of Chicago, a
community with significant cardiovascular disease disparities; 2) collaborate with community partners to select
an evidence-based, culturally appropriate intervention for depression and adapt it for the implementation context;
and 3) pilot the adapted intervention among African American adults with depression and hypertension on the
South Side of Chicago. By collaborating closely with community partners to adapt the intervention for the context,
the resulting implementation protocol holds great potential to extend the reach of and engagement in the
intervention. The implementation and effectiveness results will increase specificity and competitiveness of a
subsequent grant proposal to conduct a full-scale trial.
 Dr. Allison Carroll’s overarching career goal is to implement evidence-based behavioral interventions to
address cardiovascular disease disparities. Through the proposed research project, training plan, and
mentorship, Dr. Carroll will expand her knowledge and skills related to implementation science methodology,
particularly focused on blood pressure control; behavioral interventions to address health disparities; community-
engaged research; and health informatics. Dr. Carroll’s proposed research aims and training goals are well-
aligned with the priorities of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute as well as the Department of Psychiatry
and Behavioral Sciences at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. The K23 Mentored Patient-
Oriented Research Career Development Award will provide Dr. Carroll with the necessary tools to become a
successful independent investigator."

shown to cause inflammation, leading to lung fibrosis, the precise mechanisms of ENM-induced inflammation
remain unclear. We have demonstrated that ENM cause phagolysosomal membrane permeability (LMP), leading
to release of lysosomal proteases, which have been implicated in downstream effects such as NLRP3
inflammasome activation, and mitochondrial damage in alveolar macrophages, and significantly contribute to in

field of particle-induced inflammation and nanotoxicology and limits the ability to develop targeted treatments for
adverse health effects. Our central hypothesis is that the relative biological activity of ENM and silica is
dependent on specific surface properties that define particle-phagolysosome membrane interactions leading to
LMP. Furthermore, we postulate that ENM and silica interact with the interior of the phagolysosomal membrane

10810812,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Why patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) continue to suffer from chronic bacterial infections despite
new medications that improve CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function is
unknown. The objective of this proposal is to define how new triple combination highly effective
CFTR modulator therapy (HEMT) alters CF phagocytic cell function. The rationale underlying
this proposal is that our prior work demonstrates that CF macrophages and neutrophils are
integral to the inability of patients with CF to clear bacterial infections through several
dysfunctional mechanisms. Many of these mechanisms are only partially amenable to
treatment with currently available CFTR modulators. The central hypothesis is that CF
phagocytic cell function is dependent on functional CFTR, can be restored by HEMT, and
correlates with clinical responses. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three
specific aims: 1) Determine whether HEMT changes functional CFTR in CF macrophages and
neutrophils; 2) Assess HEMT-treated macrophage and neutrophil functional responses to
infection; and 3) Correlate individual clinical responses with phagocytic cell function. We will
pursue these aims using unique models and assays that include human macrophages and
neutrophils and association with well-characterized clinical data. The proposed research is
significant because a precise understanding of how CF macrophage and neutrophil function is
regulated by HEMT would allow novel, personalized treatment approaches to infection in CF
and other diseases. The expected outcome of this work will establish a mechanistic framework
to enable us to target and correct defective killing of bacteria in CF. The long-term goal is to
develop therapeutics that modulate host immune responses in CF patients to mitigate chronic
infection and inflammation. Ultimately, we will translate this new knowledge into a new treatment
paradigm that uses innovative host-directed therapies to combat bacterial infections."

For over two decades, the combination of a declining number of clinical scientists who
pursue careers in mental health and a high rate of attrition among those who enter the
field has threatened our nation’s ability to leverage advances in biomedical and
behavioral sciences into improvements in public health. The goal of this R25 renewal
application for the Career Development Institute for Psychiatry (CDI) is to continue a
program that provides the necessary skills, support, and mentoring network to a
nationally selected, diverse group of promising early-career mental health scientists to
help them launch and maintain successful research careers. Our results to date indicate
that fellows are very satisfied with the program, have experienced improvement in career
skills, and have successfully proceeded in academic careers.
The program is geared toward scientists at the critical transition point between the
completion of research training and the initial years of faculty appointment. The CDI
provides the necessary skills and mentoring in a multi-tiered longitudinal program, with
a focus on the developmental needs of early-career mental health scientists, including
practical career skills; long-term, multilevel mentoring; support for facing personal and
professional challenges; membership in a professional community; and a collaborative,
multi-disciplinary approach to science. Targeted career skills include negotiation;
research ethics; leadership; promotion of equity, diversity, and inclusion; scientific
project management; science communication; and computational approaches.
Improvements for this iteration include more interactive formats, enhanced mentoring,
targeted webinars, and emphasis on leadership and programmatic planning. The
program encompasses four phases for each annual class of 18-22 fellows: (1) self-
assessment and goal setting; (2) 4-day in-person workshop; (3) 2 years of mentoring,
training webinars, and community building; and (4) annual career and program
evaluations. The program directors, advisory board, and website provide a thorough,
centralized foundation for the program. CDI alumni from across the country serve as
faculty. The proposed longitudinal program will increase the number of scientists
committed to research careers in mental health and provide a foundation for improved
progress toward preventing and treating mental illness."
10800321,"All cancers must solve the problem of elongating telomeres to achieve replicative immortality. Roughly 90% of
all cancers accomplish this task by reactivating the expression of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)
gene, and a large fraction of them achieve this transcriptional dysregulation by mutating regulatory sequences
in the TERT promoter. In the previous two funding segments, we have discovered that the molecular function of
these highly recurrent mutations is to recruit specifically the transcription factor (TF) GABP to TERT promoter.
Understanding and targeting the regulatory network of GABP thus provides an unprecedented opportunity to
develop effective strategies for treating numerous cancer types. Despite the clear significance of this opportunity,
however, there still remain several urgent questions surrounding the TERT promoter mutations and GABP
function, partial answers to which we have recently uncovered. This renewal application thus seeks to integrate
rigorous computational and experimental analyses to initiate a novel framework for dissecting the transcriptional
regulation of telomere-associated genes and for circumventing potential resistance mechanisms against
precision therapies targeting the GABP network.
 The long-term goal of our research program is to establish a rigorous computational framework for
understanding aberrant transcriptional and epigenetic networks in cancers and to apply the resulting knowledge
to develop effective therapeutic interventions that can a priori predict and avoid potential resistance mechanisms.
The objective of the current renewal application is to initiate a new direction in this endeavor and develop rigorous
approaches for dissecting the co-regulation of several hallmarks of cancer by TF modules involving GABP. We
will accomplish our objective by pursuing the following aims: (1) develop and apply predictive models for
distinguishing specific ETS factor binding patterns; (2) identify key transcriptional regulators of telomere-
associated genes; (3) dissect the genome-wide co-localization and regulatory patterns of GABP and its
cooperating factors; and, (4) develop and apply methods for predicting the transcriptional regulators of immune-
checkpoint genes coordinated with telomere maintenance.
 The results of our research will establish a hitherto-unrecognized integration and coordination of mutant
TERT promoter function, telomere maintenance, and immunotherapy resistance mediated through GABP and
its interacting TFs."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease initiated by genetic predisposition and environmental
influences culminating in the destruction of pancreatic β-cells with irreversible loss of insulin production. Despite
strong predictive biomarkers of T1D, there is no cure and only one recently approved interventional therapy with
moderate effects. Therefore, identification and development of novel T1D interventional therapeutics are needed
and explored in this proposal. A potential source for novel interventional therapies is from the frequently used
Cornus officinalis (CO) in the field of ethnopharmacology.
We have recently shown that CO could inhibit cytokine mediated pancreatic β-cell death, promote cell
viability/oxidative capacity, and increase expression of critical transcription factors necessary for pancreatic β-
cell function (Mol.Cell.Endo.2019:494:110491). Our recent in vitro proteomic examination of CO stimulation of
1.1B4 cells revealed activation of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway in the 1.1B4 pancreatic β-cell line
(Mol.Cell.Endo.2022:557:111773). Specifically, we have shown that CO induces Nrf2 nuclear translocation along
with increased protein expression of Nrf2-stimulated antioxidant genes such as Glutathione reductase (GR),
Glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic (GCLC), Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and Superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2)
along with others. To determine feasibility of a CO interventional approach in NOD mice, we performed a small-
scale preliminary study examining if oral delivery of CO by gavage could be well tolerated and safely delivered
daily. Ten wk. old female NOD male mice were given CO or water by oral gavage for 14 wks. once daily 5 days
per wk. No detrimental effects were observed and mice in all treatment groups grew to similar sizes. In addition,
diabetic onset, appearance of hyperglycemia (single glucose reading >130 mg/dl) and pancreatic insulitis was
significantly inhibited in the CO treated NOD mice. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that CO can
promote pancreatic β-cell viability via stimulation of the KEAP1/Nrf2 pathway to inhibit the progression
of T1D. The hypothesis will be examined by the following specific aims:
• Aim 1: Determine the effect of CO on T1D pathogenesis in the NOD mouse.
• Aim 2: Measure the impact of CO on the KEAP1/Nrf2 pathway in primary islets.
• Aim 3: Examine if Nrf2 activation is necessary for CO induced biological effects in the NOD.
Our proposal will employ an interdisciplinary approach with combined expertise from an established research
team to address a significant need for T1D treatment. The overall experimental design is innovative and will
utilize state of the art proteomic technology in combination with in-vivo and in-vitro methods to reveal the
pharmacological action of CO to serve as a novel supplemental interventional preventative treatment of T1D to
promote β-cell survival and delay clinical progression."

separates the pulmonary and systemic circulations. This Fontan circulation eventually fails with high long-term
mortality. A failing Fontan includes cavopulmonary failure (CPF) and/or ventricular failure. No cavopulmonary
assist (CPA) device is available for CPF. Our ultimate goal is to develop a percutaneous CPA system for total
ambulatory support of CPF patients. Our enabling technology is a CPA dual lumen cannula (DLC) with paired
membrane umbrellas. Via ony 1 venous cannulation, this DLC connects the TCPC to an external pump without
major surgery. This system provided total CPA and reversed CPF hemodynamics/renal dysfunction in our
lethal CPF sheep model, enabling 96 hr survival. To move our CPA DLC toward clinical application, the
following specific aims were developed: Specific Aim 1: To design, optimize, and fabricate a new CPA
DLC for least thrombogenic/ hemolytic potential and smooth installation/deployment. Two membrane
umbrellas ensure efficient/reliable performance. Slipknots ensure easy DLC installation/umbrella deployment.
Validated computational fluid dynamics will be used for design optimization. The CPA DLC body will be made
of ultrathin reinforced polyurethane (PU) with a PU membrane sleeve infusion lumen. The two membrane
umbrellas will be molded onto DLC. Specific Aim 2: [To assess the anatomic fittingness of the CPA DLC
in patient specific TCPC silicone models and evaluate the potential of reversing pathophysiology in
CPF patients using our established mathematical model validated with CPF patients’ comprehensive
hemodynamic data]. Patient specific silicone TCPC models will be made from MRIs in our Fontan database.
A mock loop with these models will assess the CPA DLC for: 1) ability to fit/function well; 2) flow stasis/high
shear stress areas. Our patient specific Fontan simulation platform will quantify CPA flow rates that mitigate
liver congestion. Specific Aim 3: To evaluate final CPA DLC prototype in a [patient specific TCPC mock
loop] for performance, reliability, and 30 day durability. This mock loop with 37% glycerin will test CPA
DLC for: 1) flow efficiency/reliability at 360° [axial] rotation/8 cm dislocation, and 2) 30 day durability at 4 L/min
flow. Specific Aim 4: To evaluate the CPA DLC prototype for in vivo performance, reliability, and ease of
installation/deployment in a CPF sheep model. Ease of installation/deployment and performance/reliability
will be assessed in 6 hr studies (n=15). A 2-week preclinical study (n=15) will confirm full reversal of CPF
hemodynamics/end-organ dysfunction and will assess biocompatibility."

The Triple Risk Model describes SIDS occurrences when an intrinsically vulnerable infant experiences an
exogenous insult resulting in a chronically hypoxic/hypercapnic environment particularly during a critical
developmental period. SIDS pathophysiology includes evidence of chronic hypoxia exposure, brainstem gliosis
and serotonergic abnormalities, as well as respiratory/autonomic dysfunction and carotid body abnormalities.
Although animal models have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of SIDS, the lack of models
that recapitulate the hallmark features has hindered our ability to confirm SIDS pathophysiology and resolve
the major hypothetical/proposed features. We resolved this hurdle after discovering a rat model that closely
simulates postnatal hypoxia component of SIDS as an exogenous stressor in a vulnerable neonate. In this
model, prolonged/sustained (days) hypoxia exposure during a uniquely critical period of postnatal development
results in spontaneous unexplained death several days later. Importantly, in both published and preliminary
studies (this proposal) the model recapitulates ALL of the aforementioned SIDS features. Here, using our novel
model, we propose the novel hypothesis that the hallmark brainstem abnormalities (microglia and 5-HT) in
SIDS is in response to chronic disruption of carotid body afferent inputs into the brainstem. We propose that
these disrupted inputs over several days are sufficient to elicit a localized brainstem microglial response (as
seen in SIDS), ultimately leading to the fatal abnormalities in brainstem neurochemistry in key
respiratory/autonomic control regions. A particularly novel component of our proposal is the discovery of a
microglial inhibitor, which prevents the adverse effects of hypoxia exposure, thus for the first time in any
setting, we may be on the path to a preventative measure against SIDS. We also propose that aberrant
expression of several components of the extracellular matrix may be a new central (brainstem) and peripheral
(carotid body) pathophysiological mechanism in SIDS. Finally, given the compelling similarities in our model
with SIDS cases, we are poised to assess serum and urine biomarkers for identifiers of at-risk infants and
predictors of later mortality. Overall, this proposal will: 1) be fundamental to our understanding of respiratory
and autonomic dysfunction associated with SIDS, 2) provide a mechanistic perspective on the root cause of
the common brainstem abnormalities, 3) discover potentially new SIDS pathophysiology (per the requirements
of the NOSI, and 4) reveal a glimmer of hope at a prophylactic treatment toward SIDS prevention."

The cancer burden in Zambia is increasing, making it one of the leading non-communicable causes of disability
and premature death. This trend will continue and accelerate. However, cancer research in Zambia,
particularly population-based research, is limited, primarily due to a lack of well-trained investigators,
supportive research infrastructure, and adequate funding. Currently, Zambia has no cancer-specific research
training programs to address the workforce gap. Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) and the
University of Zambia (UNZA) are expanding their longstanding research training partnership to establish a new
cancer epidemiology training program, the Vanderbilt-Zambia Cancer Research Training Program (VZCARE).
The overall goal of VZCARE is to develop a cadre of researchers and educators equipped with modern
knowledge and expertise to lead cancer epidemiology research and training in Zambia, to encourage US-
based researchers to engage in cancer research in low- and middle-income countries, and to ensure long-term
program impacts and sustainability. Specifically, VZCARE seeks to: 1. Train a cadre of researchers and
educators (trainers) to conduct multidisciplinary cancer epidemiology research and build training
capacity in Zambia, targeting faculty members and researchers from UNZA, University Teaching Hospital,
Cancer Diseases Hospital, and the Zambia Ministry of Health. This will be accomplished via an intensive 3-
month Visiting Faculty Scholars program at Vanderbilt, Zambia-based epidemiology workshops, and
augmenting the UNZA PhD program with advanced cancer epidemiological curricula. 2. Train scientists and
future leaders in cancer epidemiology research in Zambia. This will include US- and Zambia-based
“sandwich” training and dual-mentored research for two Zambian PhD students and three Zambian
postdoctoral trainees, and field research experience in Zambia for two US postdoctoral trainees. 3. Ensure
and document VZCARE’s long-term impact. In addition to documenting the career development and
research accomplishments of our trainees, we will provide continued support for their career development and
foster collaborations beyond their supported training periods. With a very successful 23-year UNZA-Vanderbilt
Training Partnership on HIV-related research and education, and Vanderbilt’s substantial global cancer
epidemiology research and training programs, we are well positioned to launch this new training program with
a focus on building world-class cancer epidemiology research and training in Zambia and promoting US
investigators to engage in global cancer research."

Cardiac injury predisposes patients to heart failure (HF), and ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF).
Development of HF and VT/VF after cardiac injury is tightly linked to sympathetic neural remodeling. Although
several medications targeting cardiac sympathetic excess reduce mortality following cardiac injury, significant
shortcomings of these drugs include off-target effects, limited efficacy, and focus on downstream
consequences of neural remodeling such as excess catecholamine release, rather than preventing it upstream.
In this proposal, we build on strong preliminary data from humans, porcine, and murine models demonstrating
that satellite glial cell (SGC) activation is a central feature of chronic cardiac injury. Activated glia release
inflammatory cytokines, ATP, and other factors that modulate neuronal function. Chemogenetic upregulation of
glial calcium signaling (as observed in activated glia) increase cardiac sympathetic neuronal excitability,
synaptic efficacy, and tonic firing. Based on these novel findings, the goal of this proposal is to test the
hypothesis that satellite glial activation and enhanced glial-neuronal signaling is a primary driver of cardiac
sympathetic neuronal dysfunction, heart failure and VT/VF after cardiac injury.
 We will test our hypotheses using novel tools from a multidisciplinary team of investigators in 3 specific
aims in two murine models of cardiac injury (ischemia-reperfusion and dilated cardiomyopathy). We will test
whether following cardiac injury, satellite glial cell activation within stellate ganglia exacerbates neuronal and
cardiac remodeling (structural and functional) to promote LV dysfunction and VT/VF (Aim 1). We will
investigate the mechanisms by which cardiac injury activates SGCs in stellate ganglia after injury (Aim 2).
Finally, we will determine whether targeting glial Gq-GPCR Ca2+ signaling or Cx43-mediated glia-neuron/glial-
glial communication mitigates adverse remodeling and arrhythmogenesis following cardiac injury (Aim 3). The
results of this proposal will 1) indicate whether and how satellite glial cell activation contributes to sympathetic
imbalance after cardiac injury; and 2) determine whether targeting satellite glial cell activation offers
therapeutic potential in chronic cardiac injury."

Urgent expansion of telehealth due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have consequences for evidence based
primary care, including worsening disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. Implementing
evidence based guidelines to reverse CVD risk would prevent more than 50% of annual deaths in middle-aged
US adults but is already uneven. Guideline adherence can be improved by tailoring strategies to local barriers
as in Dr. Ramly’s prior work that increased follow up on blood pressure and smoking with higher gains among
Black patients. Yet tailoring is too expensive and burdensome to be used in practice and is even less feasible
with the rapid telehealth expansion. There is a critical need for an alternative to tailoring to enable primary care
clinics to rapidly adapt how they implement CVD guidelines after telehealth expansion to avoid worsening
disparities. In engineering, configurable solutions make menus of options available to avoid expensive
individual tailoring. This approach could enable clinics to use known strategies to address local barriers without
engaging in an expert-led individual tailoring process. Preliminary qualitative work found many barriers to
optimal care with telehealth that are modifiable with known strategies. Yet configurable solutions using known
strategies have not been applied in health care despite the potential to reduce cost and reduce disparities by
addressing local needs. Applying this approach will require multi-stakeholder design of a configurable toolkit
informed by large clinical data and tested by a pragmatic clinical trial. Dr. Ramly’s long-term goal is to become
a clinical investigator in primary care leading an independent research program to improve rapid
implementation of evidence based care for chronic conditions. This 5-year K01 will fill his clinical investigation
training gaps with mentored research and training in large clinical data, mixed methods, and pragmatic clinical
trials. As a systems engineer faculty in a clinical department, Dr. Ramly is well prepared for a successful K01
to transition from engineer collaborator to independent clinical investigator. The overall objective of this
proposal is to develop and pilot a configurable toolkit for CVD prevention. Four CVD quality metrics will be
targeted: blood pressure control for patients with hypertension, and aspirin, statins, and smoking cessation for
patients with coronary artery disease. The specific aims are to: 1) characterize barriers to implementation of
CVD guidelines in primary care after telehealth expansion, 2) develop a configurable toolkit of strategies to
address local barriers, and 3) pilot test the toolkit to assess reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation,
and maintenance, including subgroup differences. Expected outcomes are an intervention addressing a critical
gap in evidence based care after telehealth expansion, with preliminary data for an AHRQ R18 trial. Dr. Ramly
will become an independent clinical investigator building on prior expertise in engineering and implementation
science. His current and future research aims will advance AHRQ’s mission by focusing on AHRQ-relevant
priority populations (chronic conditions, older adults), problem (heart health) and emphasis (primary care)."

Mast cell response to stimuli was recently described to be sexually dimorphic with female mast cells exhibiting
increased ability to produce and release mediators upon activation. This suggests that female mast cells may
have evolutionary advantages and an important role in innate immunity. Our studies indicate that mast cells
contribute to host defense against systemic Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection. The finding of sexual
dimorphism of mast cell function is particularly relevant as GBS is associated with pregnancy associated
infections apart from its ability to infect nonpregnant adults. The overall goal of this proposal is to test the
hypothesis that female mast cells are more efficient than male mast cells in supporting innate immune defense
against GBS infections.
Our preliminary data indicate that female mast cells produce abundant amounts of coagulation factor XIIIA
(FXIIIA) and that FXIIIA deficiency exacerbates GBS systemic infections. Based on these observations, we
hypothesize that mast cell-derived FXIIIA plays crucial roles in defense against GBS infections. We will use
pregnant and non-pregnant models of GBS infection to test our hypothesis.
In Aim 1, we will assess the contribution of FXIIIA and mast cell-derived FXIIIA in preventing GBS
dissemination and adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth. In Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanisms
by which interaction between FXIIIA and GBS surface proteins limit bacterial dissemination and adverse
outcomes. In Aim 3, we will determine the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the sexual dimorphism of
mast cells, release of FXIIIA and the consequent susceptibility to GBS infections.
Together, these studies have the potential to provide novel mechanistic understanding into how mast cells
contribute to defense against GBS infection and promotes successful pregnancies. Finally, these studies will
lay the groundwork for future projects aimed at exploring the therapeutic potential of mast cell-derived FXIIIA
and evaluating sexual dimorphism of other immune cells."

TB remains a major source of mortality in young children in endemic areas, particularly in areas where there is
a high rate of HIV infection. These children are difficult to diagnose with existing assays, and it is believed that
many of the >230,000 children who died because of TB in 2017 could have been saved with better diagnostics.
A highly promising biomarker for diagnosing TB is lipoarabinomannan (LAM), a major mycobacterial surface
glyolipid that accumulates at different concentrations in the great majority of actively infected TB patients. Our
lab has recently made major contributions towards understanding the diversity of the antigenic properties of
LAM and the complexity of the humoral immune rsponse against this antigen. One surprising discovery
resulting from our work is that the urinary form of TB LAM (uLAM) is antigenically distinct from the bacterially
associated form (ManLAM), and we have identified novel combinations of monoclonal antibodies that allow the
sensitive and specific detection of uLAM. This has recently led to the production of a new lateral flow assay
(the Fujifilm SILVAMP TB LAM assay) that has a significantly increased sensitivity for uLAM over that of the
commercial assay. However, despite this improvement, the sensitivity and robustness of this assay is still not
sufficient to meet the WHO requirements for an optimal assay. This proposal will build on our previous work to
further improve the affinities and specificities of our existing reagents, and identify new reagents with increased
sensitivity and accuracy for uLAM. To better understand the nature of uLAM and provide standardized samples
for future assays we will solate large volumes (~ 2L) of urine from positive patients with a range of uLAM levels,
and freeze away multiple aliquots of these samples for future use. A selected set of these urines will be used to
purify high concentrations of uLAM from multiple patients, and the structural and immunological properties of
these antigens will be compared. We have engineered forms of existing capture and detection reagents that
have improved affinities/avidities for ManLAM, and the sensitivity of these reagents will be compared to those
of existing reagents and lateral flow assays against several cohorts of pediatric urine samples that meet the
requirements of this RFA (<5 years old, >20% HIV+). We will screen memory B cell populations from selected
patients to identify new mabs with high affinities and/or specificities for uLAM, and select yeast display libraries
generated by randomization of the key CDR regions of our lead detection reagent for variants with higher
affinities and specificites than the parental antibody. The binding properties of these new mAbs will be
characterized, and their efficacy in detecting uLAM in the pediatric samples will be tested. Antibody
combinations with demonstrably better sensitivities than existing reagents will be transferred to our commercial
collaborators at Fujifilm and other companies for incorporation and testing in their platforms. The overall goals
of this study are to develop an improved LAM detection assay that meets or exceeds the Target Product Profile
(TPP) proposed by the WHO for high priority biomarker-based, non-sputum-based, POC tests for TB detection."

Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) is the largest long-term study of brain development and
child health in the United States. The ABCD Research Consortium consists of 21 research sites across the
country, a Coordinating Center, and a Data Analysis and Informatics Resource Center. In its first five years,
under RFA-DA-15-015, ABCD enrolled a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10 year olds from across the
consortium, and will track their biological and behavioral development through adolescence into young
adulthood.
All participants received a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging,
neuropsychological testing, bioassays, careful assessment of substance use, mental health, physical health,
and culture and environment. A similar detailed assessment recurs every 2 years. Interim in-person annual
interviews and mid-year telephone or mobile app assessments provide refined temporal resolution of
developmental changes and life events that occur over time with minimal burden to participating youth and
parents. Intensive efforts are made to keep the vast majority of participants involved with the study through
adolescence and beyond, and retention rates thus far are very high. Neuroimaging has expanded our
understanding of brain development from childhood into adulthood. Using this and other cutting-edge
technologies, ABCD can determine how different kinds of youth experiences (such as sports, school
involvement, extracurricular activities, videogames, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and vaping)
interact with each other and with a child’s changing biology to affect brain development and social,
behavioral, academic, health, and other outcomes.
Data, securely and privately shared with the scientific community, will enable investigators to: (1) describe
individual developmental pathways in terms of neural, cognitive, emotional, and academic functioning, and
influencing factors; (2) develop national standards of healthy brain development; (3) investigate the roles and
interaction of genes and the environment on development; (4) examine how physical activity, sleep, screen
time, sports injuries (including traumatic brain injuries), and other experiences influence brain development;
(5) determine and replicate factors that influence mental health from childhood to young adulthood; (6)
characterize relationships between mental health and substance use; and (7) specify how use of substances
such as cannabis, alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine affects developmental outcomes, and how neural,
cognitive, emotional, and environmental factors influence the risk for adolescent substance use."
10810985,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of disability in the US affecting almost 30 million people at an annual cost of
$128 billion. Initiation of osteoarthritis is tied to genetic predisposition, chronic overload, or acute injury due to
joint trauma. The development of osteoarthritis after acute injury is particularly prevalent with more than 50% of
injury developing full blown symptomatic osteoarthritis 10-20 years after injury. Despite the importance of this
topic and decades of research, the local mechanical events that occur in cartilage during tissue injury and how
they affect chondrocyte phenotypes and ultimately cell fate are still poorly understood. Importantly, developing
an understanding of the mechanotransduction response in cartilage tissue is confounded by the heterogeneity
of cellular responses arising from spatially complex strain fields induced during impact and the heterogeneity of
cartilage tissue itself. These factors indicate that to understand the coordination of mechanotransduction
throughout the tissue it will be critical to develop a framework capable of simultaneously analyzing the real time
response of multiple signaling pathways for thousands of cells distributed in locations throughout the tissue.
Recently, we developed a novel SpatioTemporal Response Analysis IN Situ (STRAINS) tool that combines in
situ real time measurements of chondrocyte behavior with big data machine learning analysis techniques to
provide a spatiotemporal map of cellular behavior throughout a tissue explant. In this proposal we take advantage
of this newly developed microscopy and image analysis techniques to determine the location dependent
distribution of cell phenotypes and how they change after an impact. Our aim is to use these techniques to probe
the peracute response of chondrocytes to impact trauma to more fully understand the processes that occur
during the very early disease process, and, more specifically, the effects that manipulating Ca2+ signaling or
protecting MT bioenergetics have on cell fate after joint injury. Such studies have the potential to identify a
window of opportunity for intervening in the disease process of post traumatic osteoarthritis, when disease
modification is still possible. The specific aims of the proposal are to: 1) Determine whether local peak strain
magnitude affects the distribution of cellular phenotypes similarly in the superficial and middle zones. 2)
Determine how altering known calcium dependent mechanotransduction pathways alters distribution of
phenotypes after impact. 3) Determine how altering mitochondria related cellular responses affects the
distribution of phenotypes after impact. The proposed work will develop an understanding of the mechanisms
that govern cell fate after traumatic injury. Identifying the specific cellular behaviors that accompany
hyperphysiologic loading will provide new targets for future therapies in post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Consistent
with an R21 mechanism, this work focuses on developing the model and experimental techniques on healthy
tissue. Future work will expand these methods to study diseased tissue ex-vivo and in-vivo using intravital
imaging in animal models."

10814797,"Dose analysis for translating animal based vibrational force study for accelerating orthodontic tooth
movement to clinic
ABSTRACT
 Controlled Differential Tooth Movement (CDTM) refers to the ability to move teeth to be displaced faster, or
to minimize the movement of teeth to be stationary (i.e., anchorage teeth or teeth during the retention phase).
CDTM is highly desired in common orthodontic treatments such as canine retraction, canine impaction, molar
protraction, and space closure. Successful CDTM drastically shortens treatment time and reduces common side-
effects such as root resorption and anchorage loss. Studies show that an intermittent vibration force (IVF)
superimposed on orthodontic force accelerates tooth movement. Further, in the absence of orthodontic force,
IVF strengthens bone mineral density of the alveolar bone. However, currently there is little evidence to facilitate
optimal selection of stimulation level. Furthermore, lack of control on stimulation level on the target tooth
inevitably results in inconsistent reporting of outcomes. The overarching goal of the proposed work is to enable
CDTM in the clinic by transitioning from successful animal studies to clinical applications. Objectives of the
proposed project include: 1) identifying optimal IVF stimulation level for accelerating orthodontic tooth movement
in rats as well as associated side-effects; 2) verifying effects of IVF on bone strengthening resulting in tooth
stabilization; and 3) determining the threshold that can be used to scale stimulation level up for larger species
like dogs and humans. We hypothesize that: (H1) there is an optimal level of IVF that accelerates movement of
targeted teeth without side-effects; (H2) the same IVF can strengthen the bone surrounding the tooth without
orthodontic force and reduce relapse during retention; and (H3) stress in the periodontal ligament (PDL) can be
used as the threshold to effectively scale up the stimulation level from rats to larger species for achieving
accelerated tooth movement. These hypotheses will be tested through three specific aims. Aim 1: Determine
the optimal level of IVF (OLIVF) stimulation superimposed on an orthodontic load system that accelerates tooth
movement in a rat model (H1) and the associated biological responses. Aim 2: Determine the effects of OLIVF
on the tooth without orthodontic force (H2). Aim 3: Scale up stimulation level for larger species including dogs
and humans, by normalizing to stress in the PDL, and validate the theory on dogs (H3). A PDL stress threshold
will be used as the criterion for scaling up IVF from rats to dogs in this proposed study, with an eye toward scaling
up to humans in future studies. Thus, a novel method to ensure delivery of the specified IVF on each individual
tooth in the clinic will also be tested. This comprehensive study will pave the way for clinical trials using this
technology. Further, associated biomechanics and biological studies will elucidate the mechanism behind IVF
based CDTM, which will further advance the field as well as methods for applying this technology."

of entrepreneurial skills through our Translational Research and Entrepreneurial eXploration (TREx) Program;
7) development of Community Engagement training through our new Community Engagement Core, 8) a focus
on Informatics education and training, and 9) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other
CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the greater national CTSA Consortium. An important
feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from
graduate student training in our TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded clinical and
translational faculty members. Our program is enhanced with financial support from our Provost's office for
scholar and programmatic research expenses, education administrators, the ARM, and our Office of Faculty
Affairs and Professional Development. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance
our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center
of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Scholars Program is well-integrated with
other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine
graduate program, with courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career
faculty as TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their
first independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become independent investigators and members of
the ARM. We project continuously supporting 2 KL2 Scholar slots for a period of up to 3 years per slot, over
the cycle duration of the project, and we intend to include externships as part of our Proposed Novel Training.
Thus, our ICDC integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the
career development of future leaders in clinical and translational research."

 The long-term goal of this project is to understand how DNA lesions are recognized and repaired in the
actively transcribed genome. Harmful DNA lesions, caused by endogenous and environmental agents, must be
promptly recognized and repaired in order to avoid deleterious threats to genome integrity. Transcription-
coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) is an important DNA repair pathway as it removes DNA lesions
within the transcribed genome. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of eukaryotic TC-NER
initiation. Cockayne Syndrome B protein (CSB), a master TC-NER coordinator, is recruited to the DNA lesion-
arrested Pol II site and plays a key role in the initiation of eukaryotic TC-NER. Previously, we reported the first
yeast Pol II-Rad26/CSB ternary complex structure, shedding new lights on this important process. However,
there is still a fundamental knowledge gap in understanding what happens after CSB recruitment to the DNA
lesion-arrested Pol II. Several long-standing questions in the field remain unanswered. First, how does CSB
use its DNA translocase activity to remodel the DNA lesion-arrested Pol II and switch Pol II from the
transcription elongation mode to the repair mode that leads to the initiation of TC-NER? Second, how is the
DNA lesion-arrested Pol II moved away from the DNA lesion to allow the access of repair proteins during TC-
NER initiation? Third, are there any missing TC-NER factors that remain to be discovered? If so, how do they
fit into this decades-old puzzle? The objective of this proposal is to address these key mechanistic questions in
TC-NER initiation. We propose to tackle these challenging questions with an innovative hybrid approach that
combines X-ray crystallography, Cryo-EM, computational biology, biochemistry, genetic, and genomic
methods. We hypothesize that CSB plays important roles in remodeling lesion-arrested Pol II and coordinates
the displacement of elongation factors and Pol II with other repair factors to promote downstream lesion
verification steps during the initiation of TC-NER. To test this hypothesis, we propose to investigate the
functional interplays between lesion-arrested Pol II complex, Rad26/CSB, and other transcription/repair factors.
We propose to elucidate the molecular basis of the enigmatic mechanism of TC-NER initiation. We expect to
determine key protein complexes involved in the initiation of TC-NER. Our project has three Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Determine the molecular basis of the interplay between Rad26/CSB, Spt4/5, and the DNA lesion-
arrested Pol II complex. Aim 2: Elucidate the role of Elf1 in the initiation of TC-NER. Aim 3: Investigate how
the lesion-arrested Pol II is displaced during TC-NER initiation. The proposed research is significant and
groundbreaking because novel knowledge and structures obtained from this proposal will have a
transformative impact on the field of DNA repair field. Ultimately, such knowledge will provide a framework for
developing novel TC-NER targeting therapeutics against cancer and other human diseases."

Hispanic and Latinx (H&L) family caregivers of individuals living with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias
(ADRDs) are uniquely at risk for poor mental health outcomes due to increased stress associated with earlier
ADRD onset and increased severity of symptoms among the H&L population. While the link between caregiving-
related stress and health outcomes is well-documented among the general ADRD caregiver population, limited
knowledge on dynamic predictors of H&L ADRD caregiver mental health trajectories exists. Further, the
interactions between risk/protective and cultural factors that increase resilience and reduce the risk of poor
mental health outcomes over time are relatively unknown. The purpose of this study is to investigate how
interactions between contextual, individual-level, and cultural factors impact daily and long-term patterns of
depression and anxiety symptoms among H&L caregivers. Using an innovative, multi-time scale design and
analytical strategy grounded in resilience theory, we will examine intra-individual variability (e.g., fluctuations in
daily experiences) and inter-individual differences (e.g., variations within distinct groups such as those with high
levels of acculturation vs. those with low levels) and possible relationships among them. We will use multilevel
modeling and group-based trajectory modeling to test the hypothesis that contextual, individual-level, and cultural
factors interact to impact daily and long-term patterns of mental health outcomes among H&L ADRD caregivers.
To test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: (1) to examine contextual, individual-level, and cultural
factors that impact the day-to-day mental health experiences of H&L ADRD caregivers; (2) to characterize mental
health developmental trajectories among H&L ADRD caregivers using group-based trajectory modeling, and (3)
to determine risk/protective factors and mental health trajectories that predict distal health outcomes among H&L
ADRD caregivers. Results from this study will inform a dynamic framework of H&L ADRD caregiver mental health
by identifying modifiable intervention targets associated with resilience over time. This study represents a critical
step forward in developing effective, culturally sensitive interventions to support the health and well-being of H&L
ADRD caregivers who are underrepresented and underserved in the field of aging."

The Boston Health Equity & community-Aligned Learning Health System (Boston HEALHS) e-STAR proposal
will expand existing Learning Health System (LHS) capacity in a combined academic-safety net system to
create a robust and innovative program of research and training in LHS science. The integrated efforts of three
distinct cores will be managed by an experienced team of researchers and health system leaders, working
closely with and informed by a network of patients, community groups, clinicians, educators, and other local
stakeholders to ensure that the LHS research and training are community-engaged, patient-centered, and of
the highest quality, and that findings from LHS research are rapidly employed to improve care delivery.
The Administrative (Admin) Core will coordinate the overall activities of Boston HEALHS, creating an
organizational structure that provide efficient, responsive, and inclusive governance, with a particular focus on
engaging community, patient, and health system stakeholders in collaborative decision-making. The Admin
Core will oversee the recruitment and retention of LHS scientists participating in the training program, centering
diversity and equity at all stages, from job descriptions and initial outreach, through candidate selection, to
long-term professional development and retention. The Admin core will conduct a data-informed, community-
engaged process to identify priority topics for embedded LHS research, selecting those for which rapid-cycle
research results will have a meaningful impact on clinical operations and patient outcomes.
The Research Education Core (REC) will implement the LHS scientist recruitment, training, and retention. REC
leadership will fully develop the recruitment plans, drawing on multiple existing programs in our academic-
safety net partnership that promote equity. The LHS scientists matriculating in the program will be linked with
mentorship teams including both experienced researchers and health system leaders and will work with them
on detailed individual development plans that will be continuously updated during and beyond the training
period. The REC includes a large group of experts in the AHRQ-defined LHS competency domains who will
provide the LHS scientists with the tools to master these competencies, and the curriculum team will work with
scientists to identify didactic training opportunities in the PCORI methodology standards.
The Research and Data Analysis Core (RDAC) will connect LHS scientists participating in the training
program, as well as embedded LHS researchers across the institution, with linked data resources ideally suited
for rapid-cycle, clinically impactful research. The RDAC will employ community-engaged participatory research
principles to inform the selection of priority research topics, while simultaneously developing innovative
methods for the rigorous conduct of comparative effectiveness and patient-centered outcomes research in a

10797325,"Project Summary/Abstract. Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis, SSc) is a progressive multisystem, autoimmune
fibrotic disease with a high morbidity and mortality. SSc associated interstitial lung disease is a leading cause
of death. Despite important advances in our understanding of SSc, treatment options remain limited. Identifying
novel therapeutic targets for SSc is a major unmet need. Fibrosis, the cardinal manifestation of SSc, is the
excessive extracellular matrix deposition, that damages the normal lung architecture and compromises the
function of tissues. Our laboratory has identified cadherin-11 (Cdh11) as a novel regulator skin and lung
fibrosis. How Cdh11 regulates fibrosis is not completely understood and the current proposal will add to our
understanding of the mechanism by which Cdh11 regulates fibrosis as well as apply our understanding of
Cdh11 in fibrosis to identify new fibrosis targets and Cdh11 targeted therapeutics
 The current proposal will prove the hypothesis that cadherin-11 regulates the development of lung
fibrosis through modulation of macrophage, alveolar epithelial cell and fibroblast behavior. We also
hypothesize that understanding Cdh11 regulation of fibrosis can help identify new regulators of fibrosis such as
MafB and that Cdh11 can be used to target nanocarriers in the treatment of fibrosis. Proposed herein are three
independent aims. Aim 1 will further our understanding by using our unique Cdh11 transgenic mice that will
enable cell specific deletion of Cdh11 on macrophages, type II alveolar epithelial cells and fibroblast. Lung
fibrosis will be investigated in these mice and transcriptomic approaches will help understand the mechaniss
that Cdh11 regulates fibrosis. Aim 2 use transcriptomic approaches to identify new Cdh11 dependent
pathways involved in the development of lung fibrosis and will determine the extent to which MafB, a Cdh11
dependent transcriptional footprint in lung fibrosis, contributes to the development of lung fibrosis. Aim 3 will
develop novel anti-Cdh11 monoclonal antibody containing liposomes to deliver STAT3 inhibitors to Cdh11
expressing cells to prevent and treat fibrosis. These studies will take advantage of unique tools such as our
unique mouse strains and anti-Cdh11 mAb liposomes along with our team's expertise in cadherins,
macrophage biology, fibrosis, transcriptomics and nanotechnology to accomplish these aims.
AIM 1. To elucidate the requirement of cadherin-11 in macrophages, type II alveolar epithelial cells and
fibroblasts in the orchestration of macrophage recruitment and lung fibrosis.
AIM 2. To investigate the extent to which MafB regulates fibrosis in vitro and in vivo and use transcriptomic
approaches to identify additional novel cadherin-11 regulated pathways that regulate fibrosis.
AIM 3. To develop cadherin-11 targeting liposomes and determine the extent to which cadherin-11 can serve
as a molecular target for liposomal delivery of fibrosis therapeutics."

Relative to matched normal tissue, recent large scale sequencing efforts indicate that colorectal cancer (CRC)
tumors are specifically enriched in loss of function mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA); however, the
significance and functional consequences of high mtDNA mutational burden in CRC remains unknown. Given
that mtDNA encodes critical subunits in 4 out of the 5 complexes of the electron transport chain (ETC), high
mtDNA mutational burden suggests that CRC incidence and/or pathogenesis is dependent on disruptions in
mitochondrial respiration. On the contrary, impairing tumor mitochondrial respiration, via pharmacological ETC
inhibitors or deletion of genes required for the function of the respiratory complexes, blunts tumor growth across
many tumor types, including CRC. Together, these seemingly contradictory data sets highlight an intriguing
paradox: how do accumulated mtDNA mutations support CRC tumorigenesis, if mitochondrial oxidative
metabolism is inherently required for tumors to grow? Generating targeted and efficient CRC therapeutics is
dependent on answering this question. In preliminary studies using purified human CRC mitochondria we
confirmed that, relative to matched normal, CRC tumors have more mtDNA mutations and discovered that
functional bioenergetic deficiencies exclusively localize to mitochondrial complex I, with 100% (12/12) of clinical
CRC tumors displaying partial loss-of-function in complex I activity. To model human CRC bioenergetic
deficiencies in the mouse, we reduced complex I activity by 50% in the colon using tissue-specific deletion of the
complex I accessory subunit NDUFS4. Partial complex I inhibition increased both tumor number and size
following CRC initiation with AOM/DSS and induced a pronounced growth advantage in tumor-derived
organoids. These results demonstrate that partial complex I loss of function provides a growth advantage
sufficient to accelerate CRC outgrowth. Surprisingly, despite it's role as the initiating complex of the ETC,
complex I deficient CRC tumors respired normally; although at the expense of increased matrix NADH/NAD+.
Additional bioenergetic analysis revealed that CRC tumors circumvent NADH/NAD+ hyper-reduction to sustain
mitochondrial oxidative metabolism by uncoupling respiration from ATP synthesis. Thus, our preliminary data
indicate that CRC mitochondria exhibit unique metabolic rewiring that allows respiration to proceed despite
partial complex I inhibition. The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that partial complex I deficiency
induces increased NADH/NAD+ and/or respiratory uncoupling that accelerates CRC growth. Successful
completion of this project will establish the mechanisms by which complex I deficiency accelerates CRC. Given
that complex I genes are the most frequently mutated mtDNA genes across tumor types, these findings will
provide broader insight on the interplay between mitochondrial function and cancer."

Dry mouth is a significant side-effect of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer patients. Several factors
contribute to dry mouth. Decreased production of saliva is called hyposalivation. Poor quality and function of
saliva is called salivary dysfunction. Together, these cause xerostomia, or what a patient experiences as simply
dry mouth. Xerostomia can lead to tooth decay, infections, difficulty speaking, impaired swallowing, poor
nutrition, and has a significant negative effect on quality of life. Doctors recommend that patients suck on hard
candy, chew gum, use saliva substitutes, and/or carry a water bottle with them at all times. None of these are
particularly effective. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes for patients suffering from radiation-induced dry
mouth. We seek to achieve this goal by providing convincing evidence that innovative cellular therapies can
safely and significantly improve salivary gland function and quality of life. The team of investigators tackling this
project is uniquely suited to complete the work. Success would lead directly to the next phase of clinical testing.
We have expertise in caring for head and neck cancer patients, developing bone marrow derived mesenchymal
stromal cells (MSCs) as cellular therapies, and studying salivary function. The overall objective of this application
is to perform a Phase 1 trial to test the safety and tolerability of IFN-g pre-licensed MSCs for treatment of
radiation-induced xerostomia in head and neck cancer patients.
To achieve our goals, we propose two aims spread across the two phases of this application. In Aim 1, we will
work closely with the NIH, NIDCR, and FDA to complete all necessary milestones to activate the proposed
clinical trial (Aim 1) and enroll our first patient (UG3 phase). In Aim 2, we will perform a Phase 1 safety and
tolerability study of IFN-g pre-licensed autologous MSCs in patients with radiation-induced xerostomia in order
to define the recommended phase 2 dose (UH3 phase). An expansion cohort at the recommended phase 2 dose
(n=12 additional patients) will be included in order to confirm the safety profile, better describe the toxicity, and
investigate the efficacy of MSC injection to treat radiation-induced xerostomia. We will assess the efficacy using
both validated patient-reported outcome measures and through assessment of salivary production and
composition. This trial is expected to provide key data used to design the next clinical trial. A phase 2 study
would further test the efficacy of MSCs in head and neck cancer patients. These studies will also provide
important data to support future grant applications aimed at improving the salivary response through ex vivo
engineering of MSCs."

Alcohol (ethanol) dependence and relapse in abstinent alcoholics are major health problems throughout the
world and neurochemical pathways that modulate these disorders are currently under investigation. However,
the neurobiology underlying binge drinking, a dangerous pattern of behavior that proceeds and contributes to
dependence, has received far less attention. Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify the neurocircuitry
in the brain that modulates binge drinking as such knowledge will provide insight into the initial stages of
alcohol use disorders (AUDs). In the last funding period of this grant we showed that NPY signaling in regions
of the extended amygdala modulate binge-like ethanol drinking via mechanisms that overlap with NPY
mechanisms involved with dependence-like intake. The goal of the present application is to extend our
understanding of the NPY neurocircuitry that modulates binge-like ethanol drinking with a novel focus on NPY
neurocircuitry originating in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The mPFC provides top-down regulation of
the extended amygdala, in part through a glutamatergic mPFC  basolateral amygdala (BLA) circuit that is
modulated by Y1 receptor (Y1R) signaling. Knowledge obtained from the proposed studies will greatly expand
our understanding of the NPY neurocircuitry that modulates binge-like ethanol intake by linking together
cortical and extended amygdala circuitry. The mPFC integrates information from limbic and cortical regions
and has been implicated in modulating goal-directed (via prelimbic (PL) circuits) and habitual (via infralimbic
(IL) circuits) seeking of ethanol and drugs of abuse, as well as anxiety and fear learning. Recent evidence has
revealed a critical role for NPY signaling in the mPFC, and we have provided strong pilot evidence showing
that infusion of an Y1R agonist into the PL, but not IL, region of the mPFC blunts early-experience binge
drinking, and that chemogenetic silencing of Y1R+ neurons originating from the PL and projecting to the BLA
blunt early-experience binge intake. The proposed aims will use powerful and innovative chemogenetic and
transgenic tools, electrophysiology, and histological approaches to determine if a history of binge-like ethanol
drinking induces alterations of NPY and NPY receptor signaling in the mPFC (Aim 1), if site-directed infusion of
a Y1R agonist or Y2R antagonist, or viral-mediated overexpression of NPY in the mPFC blunts binge-like
ethanol drinking (Aim 2), and if chemogenetic silencing of Y1R+ pyramidal neurons of the mPFC and which
project to the BLA blunt binge-like ethanol intake (Aim 3). Together results from these proposed studies will
address a critical gap in the literature regarding the role of the mPFC, NPY signaling in this region, and the
functional interaction between the mPFC and extended amygdala in the modulation of binge-like ethanol intake
in mice."
10816519,"PROJECT SUMMARY
One of the major goals of aging research is to understand how cells gradually degenerate overtime. Decades of
work by molecular and cell biologicals have discovered several conserved hallmarks of cellular aging, including
mitochondrial dysfunction and vacuole/lysosome defects. These aging hallmarks are usually studied one at a
time and left the causes and connections between them largely unknown. What are the triggers and connections
between molecular events that step-by-step culminate at the different hallmarks of aging? Without the big picture
of how each protein changes in a proteome, often the best we can do is guess and try when it comes to the
causes and connections between these hallmarks. To fill the gaps, we have developed and implemented a new
high-throughput imaging method to systematically track the fate of each individual protein, including its expres-
sion, localization, aggregation, and timing of these changes (4D fate map), during the replicative aging of budding
yeast. The ongoing 4D fate mapping effort has demonstrated its value in revealing novel age-related molecular
signatures and the primary causes for the well-known hallmarks of aging. A representative example from our
pilot fate mapping effort is that the age-associated reduction of Tom70 is a key event of mitochondrial aging.
Overexpressing Tom70 can prevent the age-associated defects in mitochondrial biogenesis and vacuole acidi-
fication--two hallmarks of cellular aging. The goal of this proposal is to take a deep dive into the molecular mech-
anisms of these novel Tom70 functions, which will serve as an example of using proteome fate mapping to reveal
unknown causes and connections of aging hallmarks (Aim 1 and Aim 2). As our preliminary study has cleared
the technical barriers, we will finish the mapping of entire yeast proteome within this grant cycle. The completion
of fate mapping (Aim 3) will not only complement the other two aims by unfolding additional mechanisms that
contribute to the aging of mitochondria and vacuole (Aim 1 and Aim 2) but also fill the gaps between all other
aging hallmarks. This is exemplified by our preliminary results that the ongoing fate mapping provided an unex-
pected mechanism of Tom70 reduction during aging. We expect to reveal additional mechanisms of Tom70
reduction and mitochondrial/vacuolar aging when fate mapping covers more proteins. Together, this project will
advance both the depth and breadth of our understanding of aging and provide examples of how the fate map
(Aim 3) can be used to comprehensively understand the multifactorial causes of aging hallmarks (e.g., mitochon-
drial and vacuole defects in Aim 1 and Aim 2). Mining the 4D map of proteome aging by the research community
will systematically unveil previous unknown mechanisms and connections between different aging hallmarks.
The completion of this project will benefit researchers seeking the triggers and connections between different
aging hallmarks."

Background. While miRNAs have not demonstrated to be easy therapeutic targets, growing evidence
suggests that they are reliable diagnostic biomarkers in germ cell tumors (GCTs). GCTs are embryonally and
biologically very distinct from other solid malignancies and retain most of the embryonal stem cells
characteristics, including expression of a specific subset of miRNAs. miR371a-3p (miR371) has high accuracy
to identify active germ cell malignancy (aGCM) in both seminoma and nonseminoma GCTs. In order to move
this biomarker forward into the clinical practice, 2 clinical trials have been designed and are currently accruing
patients in the pediatric (AGCT-1531) and adult GCT populations (S1823). S1823 is a SWOG-lead cohort trial
that has the objective to prospectively and clinically validate miR371 in adult GCT.
Taking advantage of our group leader position in S1823, we are proposing to utilize the plasma miR371
expression data and the radiologic images coupled with clinical data collected for S1823 to create a biological-
clinical predictive model of aGCM in patients with early stage GCT on surveillance.
Hypothesis. miR371 has higher PPV than standard of care clinical tools to identify aGCM in early stage germ
cell tumors and it can be used to identify tumor relapse earlier and with more accuracy.
Aims. The aims of this research project are to:
1. Measure plasma miR371 expression in S1823 specimens at baseline and during the follow-up.
2. Integrate/compare the qualitative and quantitative miR371 expression with the clinical annotation as detailed
in the S1823 trial design.
Methods. The baseline and the serial samples collected during the surveillance from the patients enrolled in
S1823 will be analyzed for miR371 expression using RT-PCR. The CT scan images data collected at the same
time point of miR371 will be compared to miR371 expression for the determination of the PPV, NPV, sensitivity
and specificity. The accuracy of the tests individually or combined will be analyzed to define the AUC of the
ROC and to create a predictive model of aGCM that integrates clinical and biological data.
Innovation. The innovation of this research proposal resides neither in the quite basic and universal RT-PCR
technique used for the miR371 expression, nor in the simple statistic and study design. The innovation consists
in the potential clinical utilization of this highly specific biological marker for early detection of aGCM which will
open more opportunities for replacement or integration of conventional images, treatment de-escalation and
personalization on the base of biological rather than clinical evidence of GCTs.
Significance and impact: Early and more accurate identification of aGCM during surveillance has the
potential to reduce treatment burden of the young GCT patients’ population and to prevent long term side
effects of chemo and radiation treatments with meaningful improvement of GCT patients’ quality of life."

The long-term goal of the research program is to develop and establish a novel electrophysiological source
imaging technology to localize and image epileptogenic brain tissues aiding pre-surgical planning in focal (partial)
epilepsy. Epilepsy is a common neurological disease impacting more than 3.4 million patients in the US and 70
million globally. The standard clinical routine heavily relies on using intracranial EEG (iEEG) implanted into the
brain to determine seizure onset zone, to aid in the localization of epileptogenic zone (EZ), despite the limited
coverage of iEEG electrodes and invasive nature of the multiple-day procedure. There is a clinical need to
develop a noninvasive neuroimaging approach based on electrophysiological recordings that can reliably image
and delineate the EZ from relevant epilepsy biomarkers. In this research project, we propose to establish a novel
unsupervised machine learning framework that will be able to process unmarked, continuous, and long-term
EEG recordings of focal epilepsy patients to detect high frequency oscillations (HFOs), automatically identify the
pathological HFOs (pHFOs, i.e., HFOs riding on spikes), and localize and image epileptogenic brain activity from
the identified pHFOs. The proposed techniques will be rigorously validated in over 120 focal epilepsy patients
against clinical findings from iEEG recordings and surgical resection outcomes. Our specific aims are: Aim 1.
Development and evaluation of a novel unsupervised machine learning technique to identify pathological HFOs
from continuous EEG recordings. This aim will establish a novel unsupervised machine learning approach for
automatically identifying pHFOs originated from epileptogenic activity, by incorporating data-driven feature
learning methods. Aim 2. Development and validation of a novel brain tensor decomposition imaging approach
for HFO source imaging. We will develop a novel source imaging framework imaging epileptic sources in
temporal, spectral, and spatial domains. This aim will establish a novel data-driven source imaging approach for
accurate mapping and localization of EZ from scalp recorded pHFOs. Aim 3: Validation of scalp-detected pHFOs
by iEEG-identified pHFOs, with clinical findings of EZ in focal epilepsy patients. We will test the hypothesis that
the scalp-EEG identified pHFO events reflect the essential features of iEEG-identified pHFOs, and that both are
indicative of the EZ determined from clinical iEEG and confirmed by surgical resection outcome. This aim will
establish the relationship between scalp-identified pHFOs with iEEG-identified pHFOs and the underlying
epileptogenic networks. The successful completion of the proposed research will establish a novel unsupervised
machine learning technology to detect and identify pathological HFOs from continuous and long-term scalp EEG
recordings, and localize and image the underlying epileptogenic zone noninvasively and accurately. The
establishment of such novel technology promises to significantly improve the clinical management of focal drug-
resistant epilepsy, which is currently limited, benefiting numerous patients and the healthcare system."

there are no translational mammalian models in an immune competent animal that are permissive to adenoviral
infection and that allow for integration of both the oncolytic and immune effects of these viruses. The overall
objectives of this proposal are to develop and characterize a Golden hamster model of GBM that addresses the
limitations of existing murine models with respect to pre-clinical testing of oncolytic adenoviral therapy. The
central hypothesis is that hamster GBM models will provide reliable pre-clinical data to decipher oncolytic
adenoviral therapeutic mechanisms and to evaluate preclinical strategies for translation to patients. The rationale
for the proposed research is that understanding the interactions between viral oncolysis and the immune system
will uncover mechanisms of therapeutic efficacy, identify which patients might respond best, and reveal new
combinatorial therapeutic approaches. The central hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) Develop
hamster glioma stem cell (hamGSC) lines that reflect common molecular alteration in human glioma, 2)
Characterize the hamster immune response to oncolytic adenovirus, and 3) Evaluate the effects of
pharmacological manipulation of the immune system on the efficacy of Delta-24-RGD. In Aim 1, CRISPR gene
targeting will be used to create hamGSC lines driven by specific driver alterations to reflect human GBM
molecular subtypes. In Aim 2, the immune response to oncolytic adenovirus will be characterized. Using T-cell
depletions strategies, the contributions of immune effector cells to oncolytic virus efficacy and long-term immune
memory and the impacts of pre-existing exposure to adenovirus will be evaluated. Aim 3 will evaluate the effects
of immune function via either corticosteroids or immune checkpoint inhibitors on oncolytic adenovirus therapeutic
efficacy. Collectively, the studies proposed in this application will result in the development and characterization
of a novel mammalian model for translational evaluation of oncolytic adenovirus in the treatment of GBM. This
contribution is significant because it will overcome many limitations of mouse glioma models and for the first time
provide a platform for pre-clinical studies to evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of oncolytic adenoviral therapy
against GBM. The proposed research is innovative because this is the first hamster glioma model that is
intracranial, immune competent, and adenoviral replication permissive. This represents a distinct advantage over
traditional murine models, particularly in the setting of evaluating immune-modulating therapies such as oncolytic
adenoviral therapy."

The use of e-cigarettes (e-cigs) has increased substantially since they were first introduced in 2003. E-cig
devices aerosolize e-liquids that typically consist of humectants with variable levels of nicotine and flavoring
chemicals. Although there are thousands of commercially available flavor mixtures, they routinely overlap in
individual flavor chemicals (flavorants), which are far fewer in number. Many of these flavorants belong to
common chemical classes and are generally recognized as safe for ingestion. However, their direct and indirect
cardiac effects following heating and inhalation, particularly in combination with nicotine, remain mostly unknown.
Direct exposure to nicotine alone distinctly affects the cardiac action potential waveform, potentially contributing
to the high incidence of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death among smokers. Recent evidence also suggests
that nicotine in e-cigs may similarly promote adverse cardiac outcomes. Yet, the influence of flavorants on the
cardiac effects of e-cig aerosols remains untested. In our ongoing work, we found that exposure to nicotine-
containing e-cig aerosols of various flavors acutely and differentially altered the electrocardiogram (ECG) in mice,
variably inducing QT interval prolongation, increasing heart rate, and evoking arrhythmia. As well, two separate
e-liquids with the same characterizing flavorant consistently increased ventricular arrhythmias. Furthermore, we
observed in cardiomyocytes that treatment with several flavorants common to e-cigs directly altered contractility,
rhythmicity, and action potential duration. Nonetheless, it remains unknown how individual flavorants in e-cig
aerosols exert direct or indirect cardiac effects in vivo. Considering the growing popularity of e-cigarettes and
the urgent need for studying the in vivo toxicological profile of constituents in these products, we propose to test
the hypothesis that e-cigarette flavorants modify the effects of e-cig aerosol exposures on cardiac
electrophysiology, leading to arrhythmias and functional remodeling of the heart. To test this, we will
systematically identify both acute and long-term effects of flavorant exposure on cardiac electrophysiology using
a combination of state-of-the-art in vivo, in vitro, and ex vivo approaches. Specifically, we will: 1) Identify the
acute effects of flavored e-cig aerosol inhalation on cardiac electrophysiology in vivo, 2) Examine the
direct impact of flavorants on cardiac electrophysiology in vitro and ex vivo, and, 3) Elucidate deleterious
impacts of acute and chronic flavorant aerosol exposure on cardiac electrophysiology, structure, and
function. These studies, which are responsive to the research priorities of the FDA/CTP, will provide new data
showing how different flavor chemicals affect cardiac excitability and potentially promote arrhythmogenesis.
Such results would aid in formulating policies regulating the manufacture, distribution and marketing of flavored
e-cigarettes."

Tobacco use is the single leading cause of preventable death, disability and disease in the United States.
Adolescence is a critical developmental period to intervene as 90% of adult tobacco users initiate during this
period. Use of electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS), which are noncombustible tobacco products (e.g.,
e-cigarettes), has increased dramatically among youth and is associated with numerous adverse health
outcomes as well as use of alcohol and other illicit substances. National guidelines recommend counseling to
address tobacco use at every adolescent clinical visit; however, many at-risk adolescents do not routinely
attend primary care. There are more than 1.5 million adolescent hospitalizations annually and many of these
patients are at increased risk for tobacco use and tobacco-related poor health outcomes due to underlying
comorbidities (e.g., mental health disorders, substance use disorders, asthma). Although evidence supports
treatment of tobacco use during an adult hospitalization, no interventions have been developed or tested in the
pediatric hospital setting. Based on promising theoretically-based evidence from the primary care and hospital
settings, we propose to design, iteratively refine and assess implementation of a novel tobacco and ENDS use
intervention for hospitalized adolescents and young adults (AYAs). We will develop the intervention to treat
tobacco and ENDS use in hospitalized AYAs utilizing the 5A’s framework with motivational interviewing,
pharmacotherapy and computerized decision support tools. We will iteratively refine the intervention based on
key stakeholder feedback, including AYAs, parents/guardians and hospital providers. We will conduct a
randomized controlled pilot study (n=144) with 3-month follow up to evaluate preliminary efficacy as well as
implementation outcomes (i.e., acceptability, feasibility, fidelity). Through conduct of these formative research
activities I will gain critical skills and expertise in the design and preliminary evaluation of behavioral
interventions within the context of complex health care systems. We anticipate these findings will directly
inform future plans for a hybrid implementation trial of the intervention to determine efficacy for short and long-
term ENDS abstinence. This work is significant as it has the potential to increase screening and treatment of
tobacco and ENDS use in AYAs leading to decreased rates of use and related poor health outcomes."
10821409,"Transgender-specific Differentiated HIV Care Models:
 An Implementation Science Study
Project Summary/Abstract
Despite a disproportionate burden of HIV, transgender people are less likely to achieve viral suppression than
the general population and have low engagement in PrEP services. Intervenable barriers to their engagement
in HIV services include facility-based stigma and lack of access to gender affirming care, including hormone
therapy. Transgender-specific differentiated service delivery models have recently been implemented as
demonstration projects in South Africa, providing a unique opportunity to assess feasible and acceptable
implementation strategies as well as analyze the effectiveness and cost of integrating gender affirming
hormone therapy and stigma-reduction strategies into HIV care for transgender people. This observational,
multi-site, mixed methods prospective implementation study will be guided by the Gender Affirmation
Framework and the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) implementation
science evaluation framework to meet the following aims: (1) assess barriers, facilitators, acceptability, and
feasibility of transgender-specific differentiated service delivery using site observation checklists, key informant
interviews with facility staff, and longitudinal in-depth interviews with transgender clients; (2) evaluate the effect
of transgender-specific differentiated service delivery on viral suppression and PrEP adherence - testing
stigma and gender affirmation as mediators, using a longitudinal cohort of TGP clients that compares
transgender people enrolled at transgender-specific differentiated service delivery sites with transgender
people enrolled in standard service delivery sites (200/arm on ART and 100/arm on PrEP for a total N = 600);
and (3) estimate the cost associated with transgender-specific differentiated service delivery versus standard
service delivery sites using a micro-costing approach to estimate the cost per service user served and per
service user successfully treated at transgender-specific differentiated service delivery sites relative to
standard service delivery sites, as well as the budget needed for successful South Africa-wide implementation."
10933529,"What we know: There are 1.2 million people in the US who meet the indications for PrEP; yet, disparities exist
in uptake. For example, only 9% of Black and 16% of Latino individuals, compared to 65% of White individuals,
have been prescribed PrEP. At Henry Ford Health (HFH) system, only 10% of eligible patients have been
prescribed PrEP. Primary care is an ideal setting for PrEP to be offered as an HIV prevention method since
providers see large numbers of patients who are HIV negative, with some who are at increased risk for HIV,
and the primary care setting is often the point of entry to the healthcare system. The multiphase optimization
strategy (MOST) framework is a novel, innovative way to identify an efficient intervention. What we will do: In
this optimization trial, we will test the effectiveness of intervention components, alone and in combination, on
new PrEP prescriptions in primary care at HFH. First, we will generate feedback on context-specific (system
and individual level) factors for intervention component delivery via focus groups with providers (n=15) and
patients eligible for PrEP (n=30). Then, we will test the four intervention components in an optimization trial,
with 16 conditions being implemented at 32 clinics. Finally, we will generate feedback on the factors that
affected implementation via semi-structured interviews with providers (n=30) and patients (n=30). Participants
will be primary care providers (PCPs) and patients eligible for PrEP in Henry Ford Health System. Clinics will
be randomized (yes/no) to receive any combination of provider and patient intervention components. Provider
intervention components include computer-based simulation training and/or best practice alerts delivered via
the electronic health record (EHR). Patient intervention components include HIV risk assessment and/or PrEP
informational video – both delivered via the EHR. Primary outcome is the rate of new PrEP prescriptions at the
clinic level. Secondary outcomes will include PrEP maintenance, number of HIV tests ordered by a PCP, and
number of PCPs trained. Sub analyses will test which factors moderate (e.g., patient sex, race, age, gender,
sexual orientation) or mediate (e.g., perceived HIV risk, provider and patient PrEP knowledge) PrEP uptake,
focusing on priority populations and disparities in rates of PrEP prescription. Implications: 1) Understanding
which intervention components lead to increased PrEP prescriptions will represent an important advance in
HIV prevention efforts. 2) Optimizing a multi-level intervention for providers and patients to increase PrEP
prescriptions would lead to a new, efficient, evidence-based option. 3) Determining what factors are related to
PrEP uptake will help reduce disparities in PrEP initiation among those most in need. 4) Understanding the
context specific factors related to intervention component implementation will help identify best methods for
replication/adaptation in other healthcare systems. In sum, our team brings a novel, innovative approach,
robust interdisciplinary experience, strong preliminary work in HIV, PrEP, MOST, and primary care, and
scientific rigor to make a significant impact on the field."
10818949,"Abstract
With the advent of single cell sequencing and multiplexed imaging technologies, several pancreas and islet
phenotyping efforts in the United States and Europe are generating multimodal datasets, but information
across different resources is fragmented. There is an unmet need in the pancreas and diabetes research
community to connect and integrate information generated at the tissue and single cell level by complementary
programs in order to define phenotypes and spatial relationships of pancreatic cell types and how they change
developmentally and in diseases such as type 1 diabetes (T1D). Through aggregation and integration of
diverse data generated from these unique pancreatic tissues and islets, we will build a pancreas
knowledgebase (PanKbase) as the third pillar of the Human Islet Research Network (HIRN) community along
with the Human Islet Research Enhancement Center (HIREC) and Human Pancreas Analysis Program
(HPAP). The knowledge housed and built within PanKbase will be disseminated to the broader scientific
community based on FAIR principles. Better access to and integration of these rich datasets will accelerate
progress toward understanding T1D etiology and pathophysiology and lead to new diagnostic tool
development, and transformative changes in diabetes prevention and care.
Our project aspires to capitalize on features of the Pancreatlas and GenomicKB platform to build Pankbase
that will connect and integrate pancreas and islet datasets generated through international tissue mapping
efforts. In addition, PanKbase will have an analytics component that will enable the generation of new insights
into molecular signatures of T1D and importantly facilitate cross-organ analysis (for example, pancreas and
immune organs) for different stages of T1D development. We will make these insights openly accessible to all,
including: basic scientists, pharmaceutical industry, clinicians designing and conducting clinical trials to prevent
and treat T1D, and the macine learning community. PanKbase-fostered cross-disciplinary collaborations will
promote innovation, with the ultimate aim of improving the lives of people with T1D."
10819606,"Project Summary:
To fulfill the increased demand for clinical and commercial grade lentiviral vectors (LV), considerable efforts are
being made to transition in-efficient and often crude laboratory scale LV production processes to more robust,
high yielding and scalable production processes that will satisfy the more restrictive quality and regulatory
requirements for clinical and commercial supply in a cost-effective manner. However, unlike AAV vectors, where
it has been possible to establish standardized, cost-effective downstream processes (DSP) built around an highly
efficient immunoaffinity purification step that specifically enriches for the AAV vector, DSP for LV has remained
a major bottleneck owing to the intrinsic fragility of the virus that makes it highly susceptible to degradation and/or
inactivation by the often harsh elution conditions that are required to desorb the lentivirus from the affinity matrix.
Consequently, there is a significant unmet need for high-yielding and scalable immunoaffinity purification
methods for LV. These would require currently not available materials which allow for very mild conditions to
desorb the fragile vector particles from the immunoaffinity matrix. The objective of this proposal is to assess the
feasibility to selectively isolate and enrich for functional lentiviral vectors from production supernatants via the
use of Switchable Affinity Mild-Elution (SAFE) immune-affinity ligands that can be formatted into matrices for the
purification of lentiviral vectors under mild non-destructive conditions. This will be a disruptive achievement for
LV DSP as it will allow an easily scalable and cost-effective method to obtain high yields of infective LV particles
for therapeutic applications. Specifically, in Aim 1 we will develop switchable forms of an antibody scFv with
allosterically regulatable affinity to a common lentivirus glycoprotein. The allosteric regulation does not require
the large changes in pH or salt concentration typically needed for immunoaffinity chromatography. We will
produce sufficient quantities for testing in Aim 2 for initial affinity, affinity changes, specificity, stability and yield.
In Aim 3 we will undertake ligand induced release studies under mild conditions utilizing the allosteric affinity
switch built into the antibody fragment to evaluate the feasibility of selective enrichment of the soluble
glycoprotein as well as respectively pseudotyped lentiviral particles from a typical LV production supernatant. At
the conclusion of this work, we will have demonstrated that the incorporation of a ligand controlled affinity switch
into the binding domain of an antibody scFv that recognizes a lentivirus glycoprotein allows for high yielding
immunoaffinity purification of the soluble glycoprotein and the respective pseudotyped lentiviral vectors under
mild conditions with minimal inactivation of the lentivirus. Future work will be directed at generating affinity
matrices for scalable mild elution immunoaffinity purification of LV and improving the stability of the best variants
using established in-vitro evolution approaches, with the aim to improve on-site regeneration capability of the
affinity matrix. The work will also be a first in class case study to demonstrate the usefulness of our approach for
many other fragile biotherapeutic reagents where currently immunoaffinity purification is not yet feasible."

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2), has impacted global public health in an unprecedented manner. Vaccination is considered one of the
most effective countermeasures against infectious diseases, including COVID-19. Although rapid development
of first-generation COVID-19 vaccines (principally targeting the viral Spike protein) provided early hope for
ending the pandemic, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants has posed a constant challenge. A pan-COVID-
19 vaccine that provides broad protection against current and emerging variants is urgently needed to end
the pandemic and to prevent future recurrences.
mRNA formulated in lipid-nanoparticles (mRNA-LNP) has emerged as a safe and versatile vaccine delivery
platform. RNA Therapeutics, Inc. is a startup biotechnology company focused on the development of novel,
mRNA-based vaccines and therapeutics for infectious diseases. Its academic partner, Dr. Haitao Hu’s laboratory
at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), recently reported a promising pan-COVID-19 mRNA vaccine
candidate (Hajnik RL, STM 2022). The Hu laboratory generated an mRNA vaccine expressing the nucleocapsid
protein (N) of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain, which is more conserved among variants (termed as mRNA-N).
Animal studies showed that mRNA-N is highly immunogenic and elicits strong T-cell and binding antibody
responses. The vaccine alone confers modest cross protection against SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants
of concern (VOC). Interestingly, combining mRNA-N with the clinically proven ancestral spike mRNA vaccine
(mRNA-S) induces robust cross protection against both Delta and Omicron VOCs (mRNA-S+N). These data
support a hypothesis that a vaccine approach targeting conserved viral protein, in addition to S, will elicit cross-
reactive immunity and provide broad protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants.
With this technology in hand, RNA Therapeutics, Inc. and UTMB propose a Phase-I STTR application to further
develop the mRNA vaccine candidate through two specific Aims. Aim 1 will examine the durability of protective
efficacy of the vaccine in hamsters. Aim 2 will determine protective efficacy of mRNA-N as a component of
booster regimens. Impact: Upon successful completion of this Phase-I STTR, we will submit a Phase-II
application that will focus on advanced product development. Our project is expected to develop a pan-COVID-
19 mRNA vaccine that provides broad protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and the long-term goal
is to advance this vaccine to clinical testing and approval. Given the proven safety of mRNA-LNP, the vaccine
has high potential to be approved for human use in future."

The discipline of Clinical Pharmacology seeks to apply an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of
drug action to improve the therapy of human diseases. The Division of Clinical Pharmacology at Vanderbilt
offers an outstanding research-based, postgraduate fellowship program committed to training future leaders in
the discipline. The mentoring faculty includes 16 members of the Division of Clinical Pharmacology, along with
17 members of other divisions or departments. Collaborations among investigators focusing on common
research themes are well-established in the Division; this includes a strong focus on pharmacogenetics
Collaborative efforts exist in pediatrics, cardiology, rheumatology, bioinformatics, genetics, and nephrology
among others. The primary activity of trainees is research training in a mentored setting on questions directly
relevant to drug action in man. Research can vary from bench-based translational work to clinical studies. The
duration of training is 2-3 years. In the ~4 ½ year period since the last competitive renewal, 17 new trainees
were appointed to the training grant: 11/17 were women (65%) and 4/17 (24%) belonged to an under-
represented minority population group. Of the 17 fellows supported, 11 had an MD or equivalent degree (65%),
3 dual MD/ PhD (18%), 1 Pharm D (6%), and only 2 with a PhD (12%). 4/12 fellows that graduated from the
program have received K-awards from NIH (33%). Research training under the direction of individual faculty
mentors is supplemented by didactic course work and seminars. Required courses of trainees include research
ethics, responsible conduct of research, biostatistics and study design, drug regulation and development, and
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. In addition, attendance at Clinical Pharmacology Grand Rounds
and a weekly Fellows Lecture Series is required. This curriculum supplements the trainees' research
experience and provides a broad knowledge base that will allow for fellows to develop into successful leaders
in Clinical Pharmacology. There is a strong emphasis on teaching the principles of reproducible research. The
excellence of the training program has resulted in substantially more applicants than positions. Growth of
clinical pharmacology at Vanderbilt offers unique opportunities to further enhance the training program. Such
growth includes the Oates Institute of Experimental Therapeutics that focuses on pharmacogenetics and
personalized medicine; the Vanderbilt Center for Bone Biology; and the Vanderbilt Center for Arrhythmia
Research and Therapeutics (VanCART) - all components of the Division of Clinical Pharmacology. The overall
mission of the Vanderbilt Clinical Pharmacology Fellowship Program is to train investigators who will ultimately
assume leadership positions in the discipline; it has been highly successful in this mission. Of trainees
supported by the award in the past 15 years, approximately 88% are in academic medicine, industry, or
government. Clinical Pharmacology at Vanderbilt is a vibrant and dynamic enterprise supported by a training
program that is continually evolving to better meet the needs of its trainees."
10823355,"Project Summary (Abstract)
We propose to separate scintillation and Cherenkov photons produced in scintillator crystals to improve the time
and energy resolution of time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) detectors far beyond those
achieved in state-of-the-art systems. With its pico-molar sensitivity and a few millimeters of spatial resolution,
TOF-PET is the leading nuclear imaging modality for a number of diseases, from cancer to neurological and
cardiovascular disorders. A significant improvement of the coincidence time resolution (CTR) and energy
resolution would boost the signal-to-noise ratio and hence enhance image quality, resulting in more accurate
diagnoses, lower patient doses and exposure times, and granting access to a new broad range of applications
for TOF-PET. The ultra-fast picosecond emission of Cherenkov light has demonstrated to achieve the best CTR
ever reached of 30ps FWHM using PbF2, a pure Cherenkov emitter. However, this provides a very poor energy
resolution due to the low light yield of Cherenkov emission. The combination of Cherenkov and scintillation
emission has been proposed as a way to obtain both good time and energy resolution, which has been
demonstrated in bismuth germanium oxide (BGO), a high stopping power scintillator for PET, to obtain a CTR of
120ps FWHM with an energy resolution of 14%. The main reason why it is very challenging for BGO to reach
CTRs of 30ps FHWM is due to the presence of the slower scintillation light and the inability of current detectors
to disentangle between Cherenkov and scintillation. Additionally, the difference between the Cherenkov and
scintillation light emission spectra, makes it very hard to obtain a BGO detector that provides both good time and
energy resolution. We propose to separate Cherenkov and scintillation photons in order to provide a detector
that can be optimized independently for each of the signals, maximizing time resolution with Cherenkov and
energy resolution with scintillation without hindering each other. This separation can be achieved by exploiting
the different emission spectra of each mechanism using dichroic filters, which are able to classify photons by
wavelength with a negligible photon loss. This project aims to 1) obtain a CTR of 50ps FWHM and reduce the
scintillation background by a factor of 5 through wavelength classification in BGO, 2) increase photon
detection efficiency in BGO by at least a factor of 2 without compromising time resolution, and 3) reach
a CTR of 30ps FWHM with a 7% energy resolution by leveraging the hybrid Cherenkov-scintillation
concept with thallium chloride (TlCl). This project will pioneer the exploration of wavelength information as a
way to dramatically improve TOF-PET performance. We will combine this technique with other cutting-edge
technologies such as fast or high quantum efficiency photosensors, in order to demonstrate a novel a cost-
effective approach to a next generation TOF-PET. Our goal is to enable a new technology that can bring CTR
closer to the 10ps FWHM milestone with a good energy resolution in order to be further exploited in future
projects for the construction of a full TOF-PET system."
10823356,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The 2016 outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas demonstrated how quickly and dramatically a mosquito-borne viral infection can affect human life. Like related flavivirus family members such as West Nile virus, ZIKV can invade and infect the central nervous system (CNS), but is unique in causing in utero infection which leads to developmental abnormalities including microcephaly. ZIKV seems to have a predilection for infecting neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and persists for months in the fetal CNS after in utero infection, which suggests an ineffective immune control of the virus. We hypothesize that impaired innate immunity in neural progenitor cells underlies increased susceptibility to infection by ZIKV and contributes to microcephaly.
The innate immune system includes pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that detect pathogens and signal through effector molecules including interferon (IFN), which drives the expression of hundreds of antiviral interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Using induced neural progenitor cells (iNPCs) as a model for fetal CNS development, we have identified key innate immune signals that are attenuated in neural progenitors compared to mature neurons and glia: the expression levels of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I, a PRR that detects viral RNA); and the IFN-driven upregulation of two ISGs (IFIT1 and IFITM1). We now propose to extend these findings as follows: (1) we will define the developmental changes in expression and function of PRRs during neural differentiation using the iNPC system and an established embryonic stem cell line as a control; (2) we will use CRISPR knockout or overexpression of RIG-I in bulk iNPCs and in a cerebral organoid model to test whether insufficient RIG-I signaling underlies iNPC susceptibility to ZIKV infection and microcephaly; (3) we will perform single cell RNA-seq on ZIKV-infected neural progenitors, neurons and glia to identify differentially expressed genes and gene networks, revealing innate immune components that confer susceptibility or resistance to ZIKV; and (4) using CRISPR knockout or overexpression of IFIT1 and IFITM1 we will test the role of these proteins in limiting ZIKV infection in progenitors and cerebral organoids. These experiments will define key innate immune proteins that influence susceptibility or resistance to ZIKV, identifying therapeutic targets to protect the fetal brain during ZIKV infection.
Dr. Stokes’ development plan builds on a background in neurosciences with coursework and hands-on training in immunology, neural stem cells, and bioinformatics. The proposal establishes a mentoring committee including faculty in immunology, neurosciences, and infectious disease to provide guidance and career development. A K08 award will allow Dr. Stokes to make maximal use of UW’s extensive scientific resources to achieve scientific independence, advancing his career goal to develop therapeutic interventions that protect neural function from injury during viral encephalitis."

This competitive renewal of TACT2 is required to support completion of follow-up, database lock, analyses of
study hypotheses, reporting, publication, and dissemination of trial results
The combined CCC/DCC Specific Aims of TACT2 for this competitive renewal are to:
 a. Determine if the chelation-based strategy in patients with diabetes and prior MI improves the
 primary composite endpoint of event-free survival;
 b. Determine if the chelation-based strategy in patients with diabetes and prior MI reduces all-
 cause mortality;
 c. Perform an economic analysis of the TACT2 chelation strategy;
 d. Determine whether the metal chelation regimen reduces body metal burden in the active
 treatment group, and to determine whether treatment effect size is larger among those with
 larger metal burden;
 e. Assess the effect of OMVM vs. placebo on clinical outcomes;
 f. Maintain a biorepository including DNA for future scientific questions.
TACT2, if positive, will not only result in the acceptance of chelation into clinical practice and clinical guidelines

radiolabeling. SAISR has a biomedical cyclotron, biomolecule radiolabeling facility, and a fully equipped
radiochemistry facility with state-of-the-art radiosynthesizers specifically designed to support PET imaging. Three
specific aims support the SAISR objective of providing investigators with technical imaging expertise and
facilitating the design, execution, and analysis of small animal imaging studies. Aim 1: to provide and support
state-of-the-art small animal imaging technologies; Aim 2: to provide routine radiochemistry and radiolabeling
production services; and Aim 3: to provide investigators with scientific support and training in radiochemistry,
preclinical imaging, and image analysis. Monthly two-hour training sessions educate users on the latest imaging
technologies and approaches, including topics on instrumentation basics, imaging biology, imaging procedures,
and safety protocols.
Examples of SAISR impact in the prior project period include SAISR support for David Nathanson, PhD
(CMINT) in developing novel combination therapies to target tumor metabolism in glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM). PET/CT imaging of rapid changes in GBM glucose utilization by [18F]FDG, a biomarker of glycolysis,
effectively predict therapeutic responses in vivo and is currently being tested in a clinical trial (NCT03732352).
PET and MRI imaging enabled a large inter-programmatic team led by Robert Prins, PhD (CMINT/TI) to
differentiate inflammatory responses in GBM by PET from other sources of contrast-enhancement seen by MRI.
The combination of these two imaging modalities distinguished tumor progression from pseudoprogression in
immunotherapy. In a collaboration between SAISR and JCCC Molecular Screening Shared Resource (MSSR),
an inter-programmatic team led by Caius Radu, MD (CMINT) developed a combination therapy targeting
deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) using [18F]FAC PET to assess the pharmacodynamics of novel dCK inhibitors.
Follow-on PET studies showed that dCK contributes to radiation resistance in cancer.
From 2013 – 2018, SAISR supported projects from 42 JCCC members in all six Programs, representing 84% of
SAISR usage. Of this, 53% of JCCC users had peer-reviewed funding. This resulted in 136 publications, with 73
(54%) in high-impact (IF ≥10, or field leading) journals. The SAISR is preparing to submit an NIH shared
instrumentation grant for a GNEXT PET/CT instrument, with the highest sensitivity currently available and based
on technology invented by SAISR Director Arion Chatziioannou, PhD."
10824416,"CANCER MOLECULAR IMAGING, NANOTECHNOLOGY, AND THERANOSTICS RESEARCH PROGRAM (CMINT)
ABSTRACT
The Cancer Molecular Imaging, Nanotechnology, and Theranostics Research Program (CMINT) boasts
accomplished leaders with complementary expertise, Johannes Czernin, MD (Director), Caius Radu, MD (Co-
Director), and Jeffrey Zink, PhD (Co-Director). The primary Program objective is to advance translational
imaging, nanoparticle design and delivery, and theranostics with the goal of improving cancer patient outcomes
by moving discoveries to preclinical and clinical applications. CMINT Program science is highly interactive and
transdisciplinary, with its 45 faculty members drawn from four UCLA schools and partner institution, Caltech,
representing 16 basic and clinical departments. Members have diverse and complementary expertise in biology,
nuclear medicine, physics, nanotechnology, urology, radiology, radiation oncology, drug development,
engineering, image reconstruction, chemistry, radiochemistry, and animal models of disease. The CMINT
Program merges the former Cancer Molecular Imaging (CMI) Research Program with the evolution and organic
development of the prior Cancer Nanotechnology (CN) Research Program, combined with a new emphasis on
heavy particle therapy and imaging. As of March 1, 2019, the Program has $10,033,965 in direct cost funding,
including $5.9M (59%) from the NCI, and $8.95M (89%) in total direct cost peer-reviewed funding. Program
discoveries resulted in 1,109 publications over the prior project period, of which 23% are intra-programmatic
collaborations and 29% are inter-programmatic collaborations. In addition, 49% of publications represent
collaborations with external institutions and 35% are in high-impact (IF ≥10, or field leading) journals. The
Program contributed 14 patents, five approved INDs, and nine start-up companies. In the prior project period,
there were 93 clinical trials initiated by Program members with 11,807 individuals accrued. CMINT has four
specific aims to advance the primary Program objective and goal, including: (1) Developing instrumentation,
analytical tools, and novel molecular imaging approaches; (2) Imaging immune responses and responses to
immunotherapy; (3) Engineering nanotechnology-based imaging and therapeutic delivery systems; and (4)
Translating diagnostic and theranostic approaches into the clinic. Embedded within these aims are studies to
uncover and then target resistance mechanisms in peptide receptor radionuclide (PRRT) and radioligand (RLT)
therapies, and to evaluate novel theranostic pairs with high translational potential. Additional studies include
developing and translating new molecular imaging technologies and methodologies to improve the diagnosis
and treatment of cancer, and using a spectrum of optical, radioactive [PET/SPECT], and MRI imaging and non-
imaging approaches, such as mass-spectrometry, to extend the reach of molecular imaging and therapy. CMINT
Program members continue to emphasize opportunities and lead in PET imaging while building strength in
additional imaging modalities that include mpMRI, along with adding powerful concepts in nanoparticle agent
delivery and theranostics to its core efforts."
10824418,"CANCER AND STEM CELL BIOLOGY RESEARCH PROGRAM (CSCB)
ABSTRACT
The Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Research Program (CSCB) is led by Director Gay Crooks, MBBS, who
specializes in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell transplantation and Co-Director Brigitte Gomperts, MD, who
studies lung carcinogenesis and the role of the microenvironment. CSCB links basic and translational
investigators studying biological processes shared between stem cells and malignancy. Program members
expect that a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of normal and aberrant cell self-renewal and
differentiation will reveal novel biological insights into cancer initiation, progression, and recurrence, thereby
enabling exploration of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers. CSCB basic, translational, and clinical
researchers study normal stem cells and their malignant counterparts originating from two biological sources,
hematopoiesis and epithelia. Scientific interactions between the two tissue platforms integrate by sharing
common conceptual frameworks and experimental tools. The Program objective is to understand the intrinsic
and extrinsic mechanisms that control homeostasis in healthy tissues that go awry in malignancy, and to harness
these mechanisms for cancer treatment. Three specific aims guide achieving the Program objective. Aim 1- To
understand how the biology of epithelial stem cells is regulated during malignant transformation and normal
development. Aim 2- To define the mechanisms that regulate growth and differentiation of hematopoietic stem
and progenitor cells during malignant transformation, normal development, and after transplantation. Aim 3- To
determine the role of the microenvironment in tumor formation and stem cell regulation.
The CSCB program has 36 faculty from 16 departments spanning four UCLA schools and affiliated institution
Caltech, that together provide the breadth and depth of expertise needed to achieve scientific and programmatic
goals. Program members are highly productive and collaborative with 633 cancer publications during the prior
project period, 31% of which are inter-programmatic, 6% of which are intra-programmatic, and 44% of which are
in high-impact (IF ≥10, or field leading) journals. Members have support from $11,389,786 in cancer funding, of
which $2.7M (23%) is from the NCI and $8.1M (71%) is peer-reviewed. Program science is highly dependent on
the JCCC, with significant member use of all six Shared Resources, the Seed and Impact grant programs, space
allocations, and recruitment and retention of key investigators. Each CSCB investigator has a dominant interest
in either hematopoietic or epithelial stem cells, although the shared biology of stem cells and cancer in all tissue
types has led to an immensely fertile and interactive Program environment across platforms. These interactions
benefit from a close collaboration between the JCCC and the UCLA Broad Stem Cell Research Center (BSCRC)
over the past 12 years. Almost every investigator in CSCB works on at least two of the three specific aims, using
combinations of animal model systems, human pluripotent stem cells, and primary human tissues to uncover
basic biologic processes and reveal new opportunities for cancer treatment."
10824420,"EPIGENOMICS, RNA, AND GENE REGULATION RESEARCH PROGRAM (ERGR)
ABSTRACT
The Epigenomics, RNA, and Gene Regulation Research Program (ERGR), led by Michael Carey, PhD
(Program Director) and Siavash Kurdistani, MD (Program Co-Director), is the most basic of the JCCC Research
Programs. Program objectives are to support exceptional JCCC researchers and teams, to ensure ongoing
Program robustness with strategic recruitments and training, and to innovate breakthroughs in gene regulation,
RNA biology, and bioinformatics with impact in cancer. The expectation is that ERGR investigator discoveries
will uncover vulnerabilities for targeting by novel diagnostic and anti-tumor treatment strategies. ERGR
investigators employ a range of model systems, from yeast and plants to cancer cells and small animals, to
elucidate mechanisms of gene regulation, from chromatin and transcription to RNA biology, to understand and
dissect alterations in cancer. Program studies extend to physiological and pathological processes implicated in
cancer including cell differentiation, inflammation, and lipid metabolism. ERGR leads in developing new
technologies and methodologies, such as advanced informatics for high-throughput experimental tools, and
provides expertise to researchers in all six JCCC Research Programs. Although focused on epigenomics and
gene regulatory mechanisms, ERGR strives to translate new knowledge to preclinical and clinical settings, with
Program discoveries underpinning clinical HDAC inhibitor development and cell free DNA diagnostics.
The ERGR Research Program has 33 members drawn from five UCLA schools and partner institution, Caltech,
representing 13 departments. As of March 1, 2019, Program support was $11,256,579 in direct cost funding, of
which $9,904,290 (88%) is peer-reviewed, and $1,031,199 (9%) is NCI funding. Program discoveries resulted in
506 publications during the prior project period, of which 10% were intra-programmatic collaborations, and 19%
were inter-programmatic collaborations. In addition, 271 (54%) Program publications were with external
collaborators and 337 (67%) of publications were in high-impact (IF ≥10, or field leading) journals. As an example,
one achievement in the prior period was enormous strengthening of bioinformatics via recruitment. Scientifically,
studies revealed how a viral oncogene exploits cell machinery to induce cell cycling and simultaneously block
an anti-viral immune response. Additionally, new insights into the metabolic dependencies of stem cell self-
renewal and differentiation informed how such dependencies may provide a permissive environment for
tumorigenesis in the presence of pre-disposing genetic mutations. ERGR investigators cultivate a collegial
environment with many structured opportunities to exchange ideas, research findings, and scientific discussions
amongst Program faculty, postdocs, and students. These interactions help establish valuable collaborations that
raise the quality of Program science and inspire interest in cancer-related problems. An ERGR Program guiding
principle is to foster the discovery of fundamental biological processes whose alterations may contribute to
cancer development and progression, which supports the ultimate JCCC goal of defeating this dreaded disease."
10824423,"SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION & THERAPEUTICS RESEARCH PROGRAM (STT)
ABSTRACT
Director Richard Finn, MD and Co-Director Edward Garon, MD lead the highly translational UCLA Jonsson
Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC) Signal Transduction and Therapeutics Research Program (STT). The
Program brings together basic scientists and clinicians to achieve the main objective of enhancing the
development of cancer therapies targeting growth signaling pathways, resulting from work focused on signal
transduction, the cell cycle, and cellular metabolism. To accomplish this objective, the Program built a robust
translational pipeline and clinical trials network that since the 1990s repeatedly delivers practice-changing, high-
impact research and applications. STT investigators provided the first cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor in cancer
medicine, palbociclib, that then enabled two additional CDK 4/6 inhibitors, ribociclib and abemaciclib, for globally
approved treatment of hormone-receptor positive breast cancer. Preclinical data from STT Translational
Oncology Research Laboratory (TORL) identified genes that associate with responses to CDK 4/6 inhibitors for
multiple tumor histologies, providing future targets for mining. Separately, STT investigator studies in melanoma
showed the added benefit of dual MEK and BRAF inhibition in the 50% of melanoma patients that harbor V600
BRAF mutations. This pioneering research led to the approval of combinations of dual MEK and BRAF inhibitors
for treating BRAF mutant melanoma, including dabrefinib/tremetinib and encorafenib/binimetinib therapeutic
pairings. With these practice-changing translational successes using commercially available compounds, there
is now an increased emphasis on targeting STT discovery and development towards in-house compounds for
clinical translation. New collaborations with UCLA affiliate Caltech and 1200 Pharma provide pathways for
moving in-house candidates towards clinical applications. Exceptional successes for enzalutamide, and more
recently apalutamide, in prostate cancer treatment provides a flexible roadmap for commercializing JCCC-
generated compounds for broad adoption and clinical impact that STT aims to continuously replicate.
The STT Program has 36 members drawn from four UCLA schools that represent 17 academic departments.
STT has support from $18,085,846 in direct cost funding, of which $2,649,209 (15%) is from the NCI and
$4,887,029 (27%) is peer-reviewed. Program discoveries from 2013 – 2018 resulted in 1,022 publications, of
which 15% were from intra-programmatic and 31% were from inter-programmatic collaborations. In addition,
66% of Program publications were collaborative with investigators at other institutions, and 41% of publications
were in high-impact (IF ≥10, or field leading) journals. The STT Program leverages its broad scientific foundation
and links laboratory scientists with clinical investigators to help translate early observations into clinical
opportunities and investigator-initiated studies. These activities emphasize malignancies with a high mortality,
prevalence, or population disparity in the JCCC Los Angeles County catchment area, informed by community
interactions and input, and includes breast, lung, prostate, skin, and liver cancers."
10824425,"TUMOR IMMUNOLOGY RESEARCH PROGRAM (TI)
ABSTRACT
AACR president-elect Antoni Ribas, MD, PhD (Director) together with T cell engineer Yvonne Chen, PhD (Co-
Director) lead the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC) Tumor Immunology Research Program
(TI). Ribas and Chen stimulate Program cohesion and goal-oriented achievement through two independent but
related objectives, which are to provide a highly interactive and supportive environment that deepens member
understanding of tumor immunology, and to develop novel immune-based therapies for patients with cancer. TI
brings basic and translational scientists together, guided by Los Angeles County (LAC) catchment area needs
and priorities, to spawn novel investigator-initiated immunotherapy clinical trials in melanoma, lymphoma, brain,
lung, and kidney cancer, and other tumor types. There are many TI Program strengths, including in the following
nine areas. (1) Bringing new cancer immunotherapies to drug regulatory approval. (2) Uncovering mechanisms
of response and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. (3) Clinical trials of genetically engineered T cells
and their precursors with T cell receptors (TCRs) or chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) to generate cancer-
directed immune systems. (4) Non-invasive imaging of tumor antigen-specific T cell distributions and tumor
targeting in vivo. (5) Engineering new platforms for immune monitoring of T cell responses to cancer. (6)
Examining the relationship between inflammation and cancer. (7) Generating and using antibody fusion proteins
for cancer therapy. (8) Investigating therapeutic combinations with targeted agents to sensitize cancer cells to
immunotherapy. (9) Studies aiming to improve the lives of patients with AIDS-related cancers. These nine and
additional basic and translational Program strengths rely heavily upon a CCSG-funded infrastructure and all six
JCCC Shared Resources. The Flow Cytometry Shared Resource (FCSR) is the most active core and the Small
Animal Imaging Shared Resource (SAISR) enables T cell imaging projects that move from preclinical models to
patients. Outside of the six official JCCC Shared Resources is the JCCC/Human Gene Medicine Program Good
Manufacturing Practices (GMP) facility, which TI investigators use to manufacture personalized cell products in-
house, meeting local, state, and federal regulations for use in humans. The TI Program has 31 members from
11 departments in four schools at UCLA and affiliate, Caltech. As of March 1, 2019, the Program had
$19,280,597 in direct cost funding, including $4,823,507 (25%) from the NCI, and $14,028,565 (73%) in direct
cost peer-reviewed funding. Program discoveries resulted in 627 publications, with 13% from intra-programmatic
and 37% from inter-programmatic collaborations. In addition, 57% of publications are from collaborations with
external institutions and 44% are in high-impact (IF ≥10, or field leading) journals. Impactful Program research
yielded paradigm shifting discoveries in mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance and practice changing
advances with three FDA approvals since 2014, the first FDA approvals for immune checkpoint inhibitors in
cancer, for melanoma and lung cancer, and FDA approval for anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in large B cell lymphoma."
10824428,"CANCER CONTROL AND SURVIVORSHIP RESEARCH PROGRAM (CCS)
ABSTRACT
For over 25 years, the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC) has produced impactful research
in cancer prevention and control, spanning the entire cancer control continuum. This work is based in the Cancer
Control and Survivorship (CCS) Program, which has the breadth and depth of faculty expertise to tackle existing
and emerging cancer control problems using approaches from genomics, machine learning, smarter cancer
prevention and screening strategies, health outcomes research, and implementation science which can guide
cancer care delivery from primary prevention through end-of-life settings and can inform health policy.
There are 46 members in the CCS Program representing 16 departments spanning the Fielding School of Public
Health, the David Geffen School of Medicine, and the College of Letters and Sciences. As of March 1, 2019,
Program support was $26,487,925 in direct cost funding, of which $3,850,239 (15%) was from the NCI and
$12,843,034 (48%) was peer-reviewed. Program research resulted in 1,127 publications between 2013-2018, of
which 21% were intra-programmatic and 13% were inter-programmatic collaborations, with extensive use of the
BASE shared resource. Also, 73% of total publications were inter-institutional collaborations, with 34% of the
total in high-impact (IF ≥10, or field leading) journals.
The CCS Program has three specific aims. Aim 1: To identify risk and protective factors for cancer as well as
the most effective strategies for reducing cancer risk in the population. Aim 2: To determine the best
methodologies for cancer screening and diagnosis and to identify the most effective strategies to increase uptake
of cancer screening at the population level. Aim 3: To conduct research with findings that have the potential to
reduce avoidable morbidity and mortality among patients with cancer and long-term survivors of cancer. CCS
research is informed by, and highly responsive to, the cancer burden and needs of the JCCC catchment area,
Los Angeles County (LAC). The county cancer burden is high, with large differences in cancer risk factors and
cancer outcomes by ethnicity, gender, and socio-economic indicators. Thus, cross cutting themes that address
health disparities and improvements in health outcomes permeate the research conducted by CCS investigators.
Examples of impactful program research in the prior project period include: (1) Research showing very low rates
of HPV vaccination for low income, ethnic minority adolescents in safety-net settings, resulting in multiple trials
to improve vaccine uptake. (2) A study demonstrating the cost effectiveness of low-dose lung cancer CT
screening that influenced the national dialog on lung cancer screening guidelines. (3) Findings that incidence
rates for several childhood cancers among children of US born Latinas were higher than for children of immigrant
Latinas, implicating lifestyle and environment during pregnancy. (4) A study in breast cancer survivors with
severe insomnia showing that standard-of-care cognitive behavioral therapy-insomnia (CBT-I) or Tai Chi Chih
(TCC) were both effective, but access to CBT-I therapists is limited, whereas TCC is widely accessible."
10822702,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death and a global public health burden.
Myocardial injury with infarction (MI) is a common CVD that is associated with heart failure and even death. Cell-,
especially stem cell (SC)-based therapies has been of great interest for treating heart diseases, because 1) the
adult heart has a limited number of SCs and thus limited capacity of self-repair and regeneration, and 2) current
treatment strategies are only able to limit the ensuing adverse dilatation and impaired contractile function.
However, clinical translation of SC-based therapies remains cumbersome with very few successes, in a large
part due to the safety and ethical concerns over uncontrollable differentiation of injected cells in patients. As
mounting evidence reveals the SC-induced repairing functions predominately derived from the paracrine effect
mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs), therapies based on SC-derived EVs (SC-EVs) have emerged as a
highly promising approach for cell-free regenerative medicine that delivers high potency but less side-effect
associated with conventional cell-based therapy. A major limiting factor to the efficacy of EV-based treatment is
the effectiveness of EV delivery to target tissues. Indeed, most animal studies employed direct cardiac injection
in order to achieve significant treatment effects, although systemic administration is much preferred in the clinic.
Moreover, clinical translation of new EV therapies requires non-invasive imaging for monitoring and quantification
of EV delivery and treatment responses inpatients, which have not been fully developed yet. The overall goal of
this STTR Phase I project takes an important first step to translate an MRI-guided, theranostic (therapeutics +
diagnostics) EV platform developed in the research lab for effectively treating injured myocardium in acute MI.
This collaborative project, between 5M Biomed and Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI)/Johns Hopkins University
(JHU), is built on our innovations in magnetic labeling and purification of therapeutic human SC-EVs, MRI-based
EV tracking, and ultra-magnetic iron oxide nanorods (IONRs). We will focus on developing and validating a
translatable theranostic EV system, using multifunctional ultra-magnetic IONRs that are suitable for efficient
magnetic purification/enrichment, magnetic targeting, and non-invasive MRI of EVs. We will collaborate closely
to 1) develop and optimize ultra-magnetic IONRs for efficient preparation of MagEV with high MRI contrast effect,
and 2) test and validate the delivery and efficacy of MagEV labeled with IONRs in imaging and treating MI. The
benchmark of success is to achieve an optimal formulation of MagEV, i.e., minimal interference of IONRs on
MagEV functionalities and therapeutic potential together with high MRI capability and magnetism. The success
of Phase I study will lead to the Phase II project, which will focus on scale-up manufacturing of MagEVs towards
investigational new drug (IND) application and large-animal testing which will guide subsequent first-in-human
studies."
10820806,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Every year, roughly 10 million people are diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) and it is responsible for over 1.5
million deaths annually. Currently, TB is treated with a four-drug regimen over a period of 6 – 9 months and it
has cured ~ 85% of the infected people. With good facilities and support, RIPE regimen can cure up to 98% TB
cases. However, if there are no sufficient resources to monitor the treatment, success rate can quickly drop to
65% and unfortunately, most of the new TB cases are identified in developing countries with limited medical
resources. Treatment failure can lead to drug resistance, which is harder, more expensive and takes much longer
time to treat. To avoid treatment failure, it is crucial to ensure an individual receive enough drug exposure (drug
level in blood) from the pills he or she ingested, especially for people co-infected with HIV or with diabetes, since
these conditions can greatly alter the drug exposure. Furthermore, due to the natural properties of these drugs,
significant blood level variation can be observed based in individual’s physical, dietary and clinical status.
 In areas with sufficient medical resources, blood concentration of anti-TB drugs can be measured via
therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) to assess drug exposure. However, current TDM methods rely solely on time
consuming laboratory analyses using instrument that requires substantial cost and trained personnel, which are
not practical on a large scale in nations trying to eradicate TB. As a result, we proposed to develop a TDM
platform for anti-drugs that is more suitable for these areas. In the Phase I project, we are going to demonstrate
the feasibility of such TDM platform by first developing a test for rifampicin, an anti-TB drug used through the
treatment that would benefit from close monitoring due to its wide variation between individuals. The proposed
rifampicin test is based on the existing blood glucose meter (BGM) hardware and a disposable cartridge to allow
affordable testing with accuracy, convenient operation and short testing time at the point-of-care. As the
culmination of decades of R&D, today’s BGM is designed for small footprint, simple operation, affordability and
large-scale production. Leveraging the BGM technology with a familiar assay format for uses allows us to reduce
the risks and costs associated with device development and scale-up production. The final product we envision
will be a completed system that can perform TDM tests for all first-line drugs while requiring only minimal cost
and training to operate. Such system, in conjugation with better treatment program oversight may provide the
foundation for reducing the overall TB burden."
10820854,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nanopath proposes to develop a point-of-care molecular diagnostic that can identify UTI-causing
pathogens and key genetic markers of antibiotic resistance directly from a patient urine sample in
15 minutes, without the need for nucleic acid amplification. Despite the severity and prevalence
of UTIs, the current diagnostic standard-of-care relies on culture-based methods, which take an
average several days to return species-level and antimicrobial resistance information. This time-
intensive diagnostic workflow leaves many patients in pain and/or at-risk of severe infection before
they are prescribed targeted antibiotic therapy. Critically, empiric treatment of UTIs is one of the
largest contributors to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. Nanopath’s product is a single-
use assay cartridge coupled to a low-cost readout instrument. The assay cartridge integrates
sample preparation with our proprietary molecular nanosensor. Our multiplexed molecular
nanosensor is functionalized with an array of probes complementary to 1) species-specific genetic
sequences and 2) genetic markers of antimicrobial resistance. In our preliminary work, we
designed a 5-target proof-of-concept panel encompassing three bacterial species and two
antimicrobial resistance genes that are commonly observed in UTIs. Our preliminary data
demonstrate highly selective and robust target detection in a variety of sample matrices, including
healthy patient urine. Our Phase II effort will focus on four Specific Aims. First, we will expand our
target panel to encompass >95% of UTI-causing organisms and key markers of antimicrobial
resistance. This will involve rational design and bench-top validation of candidate PNA probes to
inform a finalized panel and probe set. Second, we will optimize the design of the assay cartridge
to integrate sample handling functions, lower limit-of-detection, and enable high throughput
sample processing. This aim will also support low-volume manufacturing of the assay cartridge in
preparation for verification studies. Third, we will perform a series of comprehensive analytical
verification studies on the assay. Finally, we will characterize clinical performance of Nanopath’s
UTI assay in pilot clinical study (n>200) in collaboration with Brigham & Women’s Hospital.
Successful commercialization of this technology will enable point-of-care characterization of UTIs
in <15 minutes, enabling the immediate targeting of antibiotic therapy and alleviating ongoing
contributions to antibiotic resistance. The applications of the proposed platform extend beyond
UTIs and are translatable to other clinical scenarios that currently employ lengthy culture-based
steps and molecular testing workflows, such as respiratory infections, bloodstream infections, and
prosthetic joint infections."
10790434,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Diabetic patients are known to have a higher incidence of infection, with increased disease severity and an
increased rate of multi-drug resistance. In the diabetic (DM) cornea, this results in increased susceptibility to and
the rapid progression of microbial keratitis. To date, the mechanisms underlying this are unknown. To address
this critical and understudied question, Pseudomonas (P.) aeruginosa and Staphylococcus (S.) aureus keratitis
models with Streptozotocin-induced type 1 (T1) and db/db type 2 (T2) DM mice were established. In our models,
higher inocula of both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were required to infect mouse corneas and bacterial keratitis
progressed faster in DM, compared to normoglycemia B6 mice, mimicking human diabetic infectious keratitis.
High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), in combination with comprehensive bioinformatics, was used to
identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and biological processes associated with the increased
susceptibility and severity of diabetic BK. Our preliminary data show that P. aeruginosa infection resulted in many
DEGs, some of which have not been linked previously to the pathogenesis of bacterial keratitis. Gene Ontology
enrichment analysis revealed that programmed cell death (PCD) pathways, known to play a key role in
homeostasis and in the pathogeneses of many human diseases, including DM and sepsis, were altered during
P. aeruginosa infection. Our preliminary data showed that while noninflammatory apoptosis was decreased, lytic
PCDs, including caspase-8, receptor-interacting protein family of serine/threonine protein kinases (RIPK)-1 and
-3, mediated necroptosis, NETosis, a biological process to generate neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), as
well as efferocytosis that removes cell corpses, were elevated in DM, compared to NL corneas in response to P.
aeruginosa infection. The hypothesis that DM causes lytic PCD pathways and impairs efferocytosis,
resulting in increased susceptibility and severity of BK will be tested with three specific aims:
(1) To test the
hypothesis that DM skews PCD from apoptosis to necroptosis, resulting in hyperinflammation and tissue damage.
This can be tested by assessing the levels of cleaved (activated) caspase-8 (apoptosis), phospho-RIPK1, and 3
(necroptosis), and by targeting Casp8 and RIPK1, 3 in both T1 and T2 DM mice. (2) To test the hypothesis that
DM primes PMNs for NETosis, increasing bacterial burden, and keratitis severity in B6 mouse corneas. This
can be tested by assessing the generation of Neutrophil extracellular traps containing neutrophil granule proteins
and host DNA that were modified by peptidyl arginine deiminase (PAD)-4 and nuclear neutrophil elastase and
blockade of DAD4 in T1 and T2DM mice. (3) To test the hypothesis that DM impairs efferocytosis, resulting in
secondary necrosis and tissue deterioration in bacterial infected B6 mouse corneas. This can be tested by
measuring macrophage efferocytosis of dead corneal epithelial cells and neutrophils and assessing the
effectiveness of promoting efferocytosis on bacterial clearance and tissue preservation. This proposed study will
allow for a better understanding of cornea immunity, identify factors and pathways responsible for the increased
susceptibility of diabetic corneas to microbial infection, and lead to the identification of mechanism-based
therapies for treating microbial keratitis, for both T1 and T2DM patients. CDC (1/22/2023) reported one death,
three (five more recently) with permanent vision loss, and at least 50 people infected with antibiotic-resistant P.
aeruginosa, linked to the use of EzriCare eye drops. Hence, our proposal is timely, necessary, and relevant."
10807396,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death globally and the identification of
individuals at high risk to target early prevention strategies is a major public health need. Commonly used
clinical risk estimators are validated for limited age and ancestry groups and are poorly calibrated to
contemporary populations, limiting their utility. Polygenic scores (PGS) – which quantify inherited risk by
summing information from many common sites of DNA variation – hold considerable promise for improving
upon available clinical risk estimators, however available PGS for CAD currently lack proper actionability
due to limitations of input data, score methodology, and clinical applications. More comprehensive and
equitable tools incorporating genetic risk are needed to predict risk earlier in life to enable preventive
interventions and reduce morbidity and mortality of CAD. Dr. Patel proposes to develop more generalizable
PGS for CAD using multi-ancestry genomic data; to construct clinically interpretable, absolute CAD risk
prediction models integrating genetic and non-genetic factors; and to investigate new clinical indications for
PGS use utilizing clinical trial data. In Aim 1, Dr. Patel will develop new PGS for CAD optimized for
individuals of diverse ancestries by harnessing the principle of burrowing information from functional
genomic annotations, cross-ancestry correlation, and cross-trait correlation to refine the effect estimates of
genetic variants included in these scores. In Aim 2, Dr. Patel will integrate polygenic risk with clinical risk
factors to develop a absolute risk prediction models for CAD, which he will then calibrate, validate, and
deploy in external datasets. In Aim 3, Dr. Patel will define clinical use indications for PGS using secondary
analyses of CAD prevention clinical trials within the context of individuals with inflammatory mediators
including HIV and elevated C-reactive protein. The overall goal for this application is to advance the
actionability of PGS by addressing their limitations in equity, interpretability, and indication. Upon successful
completion of these aims, Dr. Patel expects to deliver better-performing and cross-ancestry portable CAD
PGS, share externally validated, integrated absolute risk prediction models, report utility for PGS use in
specific sub-populations for guiding therapies, and nominate inflammatory mechanisms to target in future
trials. These endpoints will collectively advance the actionability of PGS models for CAD, moving closer to
their clinical deployment for disease prevention. This research will be accomplished in the setting of a
comprehensive career development program designed to provide Dr. Patel with the skills needed to
become an independent physician-scientist in cardiovascular genomics. This proposal brings together a
unique interdisciplinary advisory team of experts in the fields of epidemiology, genomics, statistics, and
clinical trials research that will guide Dr. Patel in his transition to scientific independence."
10807829,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are devastating childhood brain tumors for which there are no effective
therapies. While histone mutations are thought to be a critical tumor initiating event, they are insufficient for
glioma formation and co-occur with somatic alterations in other pathways, including MYC and growth factor
receptor signaling. I have recently discovered that a subset of DMGs aberrantly express the forkhead
transcription factor FOXR2. FOXR2 is sufficient to enhance DMG formation and also required for FOXR2-
expressing DMGs. FOXR2 DNA-binding is highly enriched at E26 transformation-specific (ETS) motifs, and
FOXR2 specifically activates ETS transcriptional circuits. Moreover, FOXR2-expressing DMGs lack
amplifications and genetic events in growth factor receptor pathways, suggesting functional redundancy. Indeed,
phosphoproteomic evidence shows that FOXR2-expressing cells activate MAPK signaling. These findings
provide the rationale to study how aberrant FOXR2 expression cooperates with ETS transcription factors to
enhance DMG formation by activating downstream pathways, including MAPK signaling. To advance our
understanding of FOXR2-expressing DMGs, this proposal will pursue the following two Specific Aims: 1) Test
the hypothesis that ETS transcription factors are required for FOXR2-mediated oncogenesis and 2) Test the
hypothesis that the oncogenic phenotype of FOXR2 is mediated through MAPK signaling.
 I am currently an Instructor in Pediatrics and a Pediatric Neuro-Oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
with 80% of my time protected for research. I am fully committed to a career as a physician-scientist, with the
goal of elucidating DMG disease mechanisms to advance patient care. The purpose of this career development
award is to fill a critical gap in my training and enable me to gain specific skills in in vivo animal modeling of
pediatric brain tumors and high-throughput genetic perturbation approaches. I have chosen an outstanding
mentorship team, Dr. Pratiti Bandopadhayay and Dr. Myles Brown. Dr. Bandopadhayay is an established leader
in pediatric brain tumor genomics, and Dr. Brown is an international leader in epigenomics and chromatin biology
with extensive experience in mentoring physician-scientists. My scientific advisory committee includes experts
reflecting key areas of my training plan: Drs. Eric Fischer (proteomics), Timothy Phoenix (murine glioma models),
Keith Ligon (immunohistochemical analyses of murine models), and Kim Stegmaier (pediatric cancer genomics
and high-throughput genetic perturbation assays). I will moreover collaborate with Dr. John Doench (high-
throughput genetic perturbation methods and analyses) to gain expertise. Under the mentorship of my co-
mentors and the commitment of my scientific advisory committee, I will train in the stimulating environments of
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Broad Institute, both outstanding institutions with tremendous resources.
The K08 award offers me further mentored research time and essential career development training to ultimately
emerge as an independent physician-scientist investigator in the field of Pediatric Neuro-Oncology."
10807458,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Drug-resistant epilepsy affects approximately 1 million people in the United States. Responsive neural
stimulation (RNS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) offer novel treatment options for refractory seizures. These
neurostimulation therapies have significant advantages over surgical resection, though they are generally less
effective. Treatment optimization has been challenging due to inter-patient variability, electrode placement, and
the vast range of available stimulation parameters. This project aims to provide a more comprehensive
description of the spatial and temporal dynamics that underlie neurostimulation and evaluate novel therapeutic
effects that could prevent and modify the disease course in epilepsy.
 This proposal also outlines a five-year career development program focused on acquiring the skills necessary
to perform an in-depth mechanistic analysis of neurostimulation in a rodent model of temporal lobe epilepsy.
Washington University provides an excellent environment of collaborators and resources to develop skills
necessary for investigating neurostimulation as a treatment modality for epilepsy. The outlined proposal builds
on Dr. Foutz's prior research in deep brain stimulation and his clinical training in the field of epilepsy. Under the
mentorship of Michael Wong, M.D., Ph.D. (basic scientist, clinical epileptologist), and Dominique Durand, Ph.D.
(basic scientist, biomedical engineer), he will investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics underlying electrical
neurostimulation and evaluate anti-epileptogenic effects. Dr. Foutz has a career goal to become a translational
scientist focused on developing and optimizing device-based neuromodulatory treatments for patients with
epilepsy. The career development plan outlines formal and informal training in animal models of epilepsy and
neurostimulation. This work's potential impact is to optimize existing devices, guide the development of next-
generation neurostimulation technology and discover novel therapeutic effects of neurostimulation in epilepsy."
10807560,"Project Summary
Synaptic loss is theorized to occur early in the course of common neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as
Alzheimer disease (AD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD). Until recently, the evaluation of synaptic loss in the
human brain depended on the availability of pathologic/autopsy material, which inevitably did not represent early
stages of disease. In the past few years, development of radiopharmaceuticals that target SV2A, a ubiquitous
synaptic protein, have made it possible to quantify synaptic density in the human brain in vivo. One long-term
goal of the collaborative neuroimaging programs at UW-Madison is to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to understand and detect preclinical stages of neurodegeneration in
AD and ADRD. The objective of this proposal is to use SV2A PET, acquired simultaneously with diffusion and
structural MRI, to evaluate the sequence and topography of synaptic, white matter microstructural, and
volumetric changes that correspond to prodromal and manifest stages of LBD. The central hypothesis is that
lower synaptic density in neocortex and hippocampus will be detectable at earlier disease stages than reductions
in white matter microstructural integrity and will correspond to or predict cognitive decline. The rationale for this
proposal is that participants selected and carefully characterized to represent the spectrum of disease stages
from healthy aging to prodromal LBD will provide a representative cohort from which to draw conclusions
regarding the sequence of brain changes that occur prior to clinical disease onset. For this project we will recruit
160 human research participants, 120 of whom have significant risk factors to develop LBD: Forty participants
with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and normal cognition (RBD-NC), 40 participants with early-
stage Parkinsonism and normal cognition (PD-NC), and 40 participants who meet research criteria for mild
cognitive impairment with Lewy body (MCI-LB), as well as 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We are
experienced in and will perform extensive motor and cognitive characterization of these individuals at baseline
and 2-year follow-up intervals. All participants will undergo structural and diffusion MRI as well as SV2A PET at
baseline; a subset of participants (~35) who show cognitive decline during the study will be re-imaged with SV2A
PET/MRI at follow-up. Using the SV2A PET and MRI data, the specific aims will be to (1) map differences in
synaptic density between control, RBD-NC, PD-NC, and MCI-LB at baseline, (2) determine the relationship
between synaptic density within prespecified neo and allocortical regions and cognitive decline, and (3)
determine the degree to which reduced synaptic density occurs independent of microstructural and structural
change prior to dementia. The significance of this project is that it evaluates important hypotheses regarding
the role of synaptic loss as an early event in and cause of cognitive change in LBD. This project is innovative
because few studies have evaluated SV2A in prodromal stages of LBD, including RBD and MCI-LB. The positive
impact of this work will be to develop biomarkers for the future evaluation of intervention therapies."
10930920,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 In the past two decades, over half a million people in the United States have died of an opioid
overdose, and currently nearly 3 million Americans struggle with opioid use disorder. Medications for opioid
use disorder (MOUD), such as buprenorphine and methadone, are effective in decreasing a person’s risk of
death and disease from opioid use. However, only a small minority of people who would benefit from these
medications have access to them. Although this treatment gap is multifactorial, treatment initiation locales
outside of the current addiction paradigm are necessary to address the increasing morbidity and mortality of
the opioid epidemic.
 Existing evidence demonstrates that buprenorphine dispensed from the Emergency Department (ED)
increases the likelihood a person will be in treatment at 30 days, and treatment adherence is strongly linked
to morbidity and mortality. Based on the known effectiveness of MOUD, the American College of Emergency
Physicians recently released a recommendation that all appropriate patients be offered these medications
when seen for ED care. However, most patients seen in a US ED are not offered these medications.
Research demonstrates that interpersonal barriers such as stigma and mistrust may preclude effective
conversations regarding these treatment options. Shared Decision-Making (SDM) – where clinicians
specifically invite patients into clinical decision-making when options are available – has been used to
increase the patient-centeredness of care in numerous settings but has generally not been employed in the
ED for patients with opioid use disorder. Through stakeholder engagement, our team has created an
intervention, Talk About It, which uses an SDM framework to facilitate conversations about MOUD in the ED.
Conversations can foster empathy, build trust, diminish stigma, and help people start their path to recovery.
Additionally, U.S. policy regarding the prescription of MOUD recently changed, vastly increasing the number
of potential prescribers. These providers, however, will need tools for these challenging conversations.
 Our long-term goal is to increase and improve discussions about MOUD in the ED, increasing initiation
and adherence, and decreasing morbidity and mortality. In Aim 1 of this R34, we will refine our intervention
via qualitative and quantitative feedback from clinicians and patients. In Aim 2, we will pilot procedures for a
fully powered multicenter trial. Aim 2 includes: A) a pilot of the training intervention for clinicians, including
the collection of baseline and 12-month data; B) prospective enrollment of patients and collection of patient-
centered outcomes; C) assessment of clinical outcomes; and D) a feasibility analysis of study procedures.
This will be the first study to use the patient-centered framework of Shared Decision-Making to address this
substantial treatment gap – increasing the ability of ED clinicians to meaningfully address the devastating
morbidity and mortality of the opioid epidemic."
10811714,"NIH SBIR PA-18-871 w/o Clinical Trials A Safe and Compact Neonate to Adult Neuroimaging MRI System
The intriguing human brain is the most imaged end-organ non-invasively, without ionizing radiation using
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). High spatial resolution brain MRI is an established diagnostic tool to
assess injury mechanisms affecting newborn growth and the adult human connectome. To predict neuro-
developmental outcome necessary to validate effectiveness of therapy in infants and adults, mapping
dynamic anatomical and functional connectivity in the human brain is essential. However, many unstable
premature newborns are kept from stat MRI diagnosis because transport to adult MRIs located remotely
in the radiology department is highly risky. Serial MRI necessary to validate effectiveness of therapy or
clinical intervention requiring multiple transports between the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and MRI
sections places additional burden on the NICU staff and the baby. In its current form adult MRI's with many
unrelated and unsuitable features for kids are expensive, complex and impractical for routine clinical use.
The overall goal of this SBIR project is to create a compact MRI system, by combining innovations in
patient-centric care and salient imaging technology. This safe system can be installed for whole-body
imaging of sick children in the neonatal, pediatric and cardiac intensive care units. The `low-intrinsic risk'
design ideal for safe pediatric use will be widely accepted by the hospital staff. The compact MRI is
concurrently designed for imaging the adult brain, and suitable for installation in any hospital department
or on a truck. The human connectome project (HCP) uses diffusion and BOLD-based functional MRI to
derive whole-brain structural and functional connectivity maps for individual subjects at 1.25-2mm
resolution (2-8µL voxels). Our research imaging goals are to attain targets between 0.125µL and 0.5µL
isotropic voxels with the 100mT/m strong gradients over the neonatal and adult brain in support of research
in reasonable scan times. Enhanced image quality obtained with the strong gradients can help unravel
brain development and repair associated with a variety of neurological, psychiatric, neurodegenerative and
congenital disorders. Our technology alleviates cost and safety burdens imposed by large foot-print adult
whole-body MRIs on the hospital and pediatric patients. Multiple uses of the custom, compact MRI system
with its combined patient-centric care and radiology approach proposed is original. A successful project
will shift the trend from radiology based scanners to clinical departments where stat diagnosis is possible
for pediatric patients and adults. Success of this project will stimulate development of a mobile mental
health and stroke detection MRI systems, ultra-compact MRIs for extremity and small animal imaging, and
mid- to low-field off-grid MRI for world use. A safer compact MRI for 0-2 year olds and adult is needed and
will dramatically increase the quality of clinical MRI and connectome research. This project will also support
advanced diagnosis in patients with lung, cardiac and musculoskeletal disorders."
10800356,"Abstract/Project Summary
Studies of physical and cognitive decline in persons older than 85 years are limited but suggest that late
measures of traditional risk factors have little predictive value and some inverse associations with risk.
Rigorous evidence regarding modifiable risk factors in midlife and older age could improve dementia
prevention efforts and health among the oldest old. In ARIC-NCS, with its large population and >35 years of
follow up, including the longest followed cohort of African-Americans for cognition, midlife vascular risk factors
(VRF) strongly predict dementia, frailty, physical function, and both cognitive and physical decline occurring
before age 85. Only cognitive status and physical function reliably predict dementia after 85. This raises a
compelling need to better understand risk among the oldest-old (85+ years) including deeper phenotyping to
discover markers which may explain the attenuation and distortion of risk associations at older age. The use of
blood-based biomarkers in dementia diagnosis and prediction requires assessments across the lifespan and
extension to diverse cohorts. ARIC allows exploration of differences in predictors of dementia (measured from
midlife to older age) among distinct risk groups (<85 vs 85+ years, sex, multimorbidity, and race). The
proposed fourth cycle of ARIC-NCS builds on high productivity (245 papers since 2009) to continue rigorous
data collection (proposed visits 11-13 and dementia surveillance on ~4,000 living participants ages 81-101,
~70% female and ~25% African-American; accumulating 4732 dementia cases, half over age 85 by 2028) and
address pressing questions. ARIC-NCS offers major advantages over most published studies, with over 30+
years of data in a diverse cohort starting in midlife on: (1)VRF, multimorbidity and medications; (2)behaviors
and social determinants of health (SDOH); (3)genetic, genomic, and metabolic markers; (4) longitudinal
plasma biomarker assessment; (5)quantitative brain imaging (5438 MRIs and 1146 amyloid PET; an additional
~400 of each expected in 2023); and (6)clinical outcomes, to which we will collect additional measurement of
multimorbidity, repeated biomarkers, cognitive and physical function, sleep and activity. ARIC-NCS can control
for an extensive range of covariates and modifiers, and we will consider race- and sex-specific analyses. The
specific aims are: 1) Longitudinally study blood biomarkers (~5000 proteins and targeted blood AD
biomarkers (amyloid, p-tau, NfL and GFAP) across 4 decades) in relation to: (i) dementia; (ii) mild cognitive
impairment; (iii) multimorbidity and frailty; (iv) cognitive and physical function (e.g. short physical function
battery, gait speed) decline. 2) To evaluate the association and interaction of midlife VRF, multimorbidity
(including disturbed sleep), and SDOH with blood (proteomic and targeted AD and neurodegeneration
markers) and brain imaging (MRI & amyloid PET) dementia biomarkers and their progression. 3) Contrast
associations of vascular risk factors, cognitive and physical function and multimorbidity with dementia,
cognitive and physical decline across ages (65-84 vs. 85+) and their modification by health at older age."
10800378,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Polymicrobial infections are a significant health concern to humans. Multi-species biofilms exhibit greatly
increased antibiotic resistance, and systemic infections with more than one etiologic agent are difficult to treat
and often more lethal than infections with a single pathogen. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm)
is a food-borne bacterial pathogen that causes gastroenteritis in over 1.35 million people in the US every year.
Recently, a clinical study with 2500 patients uncovered that the under-studied fungal component of the
microbiome is an important modulator of Salmonella enterica infections. When patients were colonized with the
opportunistic pathogenic yeast Candida spp, they were more likely to be infected with S. Typhi or S. Paratyphi.
C. albicans is a frequent gut colonizer and can be found more than 60% of people. The commensal yeast can
easily transition to become pathogenic and breach epithelial barriers with its filamentous hyphae. It is also
associated with gut inflammatory diseases like Crohn’s disease. The two gut pathogens STm and C. albicans
thrive in an inflamed intestine and are likely to co-occur frequently. Nevertheless, the role of C. albicans during
Salmonella infection is currently completely unknown. Our long-term goal is to understand the role of
gastrointestinal fungi during STm pathogenesis. The specific goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism
of how the presence of C. albicans in the gut increase STm colonization and systemic dissemination. Our data
show that commensal C. albicans abundance in the mycobiota increased after STm infection of mice and
positively correlated with disease severity. During co-infection with STm and C. albicans, mice showed
significantly increased STm load in cecum, spleen and liver, and more weight loss compared to STm single
infection. Despite two pathogens present, the early host immune response to co-infection was significantly
blunted compared to single infections. The lower inflammatory response might result in inefficient clearance
and increased dissemination of STm. In the presence of C. albicans in vitro, STm upregulated virulence genes
and showed significantly increased invasion of colonic epithelial cells. We hypothesize that the increased
virulence of STm in the presence of C. albicans is the result of two distinct mechanisms: (A) direct bacteria-
fungi and (B) host-dependent interactions. With this proposal, we will therefore determine in Aim 1 which C.
albicans factors directly modulate STm virulence gene expression, mediate binding to STm, and result in higher
STm dissemination in two mouse models. In Aim 2 we will elucidate which host cells, signaling molecules and
microbial determinants are involved in modulation of the immune response during co-infection. In summary, we
will study the cross-kingdom interaction of two important gut pathogens and will provide mechanistic detail on
how the presence of C. albicans modulates STm pathogenicity."
10811039,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Common fragile sites (CFSs) are recurrent “wounds” in every person's genome that predispose
the chromosomes to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and rearrangements. Known features
associated with CFSs include late replication timing, which is further enhanced upon replication
stress, and large transcribed genes, which may cause replication-transcription conflict. CFS
formation/breakage underlies a wide variety of human diseases, including cancer and neurological
disorders. We recently mapped replication stress-induced DNA DSBs in a normal human
lymphoblastoid cell line, using Break-seq, a powerful NextGen-sequencing based technique
developed in my laboratory. DSBs, with or without replication stress, are associated with late
replication timing. However, these DSBs were not enriched inside large transcribing genes, nor are
they enriched inside cytologially defined CFS core sequences. We hypothesize that the differences
between Break-seq signals and CFS core sequences are attributable to the inherent differences
between technological platforms as each is biased toward a partial feature of the human CFS, with
Break-seq detecting the DSBs whereas the cytological methods detecting ssDNA gaps. The main
objective of our proposal is to directly test this hypothesis by creating an upgraded sequencing
technology, Fragile Site (FS)-seq, to simultaneously map ssDNA gaps and DSBs (Aim 1). Moreover,
preliminary evidence suggests that the ssDNA inside the CFS core sequences is a consequence of
“rogue” DNA initiation events upon high levels of DNA replication stress. Therefore, we will test if
alterations in replication timing gives rise to ssDNA at the CFS core regions (Aim 2). The proposed
project will bridge the gap in our current understanding of the mechanisms of CFS formation and
genome instability."

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to estimate the correlations between brain regions. De-
spite the many insights into brain function provided by fMRI, the ﬁeld is currently experiencing a reproducibility
crisis. For instance, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is thought to be the result of disordered brain connections,
but the ASD literature contains conﬂicting reports of both hypo- and hyper-connectivity. Participant head motion
is a crucial factor, and the exclusion of high-motion participants can reduce the impacts of motion. However,
motion quality control removes more than 50% of data in pediatric fMRI studies. In ASD, the most severely im-
paired children tend to be removed – we are characterizing a limited part of the autism spectrum. In addition,
methodological development and empirical studies have focused on functional connectivity measured at rest.
Children move less during some tasks, such as watching a movie. Dynamic connectivity during a task may offer
crucial insights into diseases of brain connectivity with larger effect sizes, but popular methods do not utilize task
information during model ﬁtting. The overall objective of this grant is to develop statistical methods that decrease
bias and improve efﬁciency in functional connectivity studies. Our proposal is motivated by a resting-state fMRI
study on ASD with hundreds of children from the Kennedy Krieger Institute and Johns Hopkins University. We
will assess external validity in an independent test dataset that will be collected at the Marcus Autism Center and
Emory University, where we will also conduct a study of engagement during a movie with social interactions. To
achieve our objective, we propose the following: 1) Develop a missing data method for deconfounding to reveal
functional connectivity signatures of ASD. This aim addresses sampling biases due motion quality control. 2)
Develop a causal mediation framework for signal decomposition of functional connectivity and motion. This aim
will be used to disentangle neural versus motion contributions to function connectivity in ASD. 3) Develop a novel
covariance regression model for dynamic functional connectivity during a task. This aim will test the scientiﬁc
hypothesis that the neural underpinnings of engagement differ in children with ASD compared to typically devel-
oping children. We will develop software so that the proposed methods can be broadly applied to neuroimaging
studies including neurological disorders and mental health. Completing these aims will 1) provide tools that will
improve reproducibility in functional connectivity studies and 2) reveal the neural underpinnings of ASD. This can
aid in the development of treatments and educational strategies."
10814776,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Successful memory retrieval is one of the most important functions in our brain. Numerous studies have shown
that hippocampal-entorhinal (HPC-EC) circuits play crucial roles in encoding and retrieval of specific episodic
memories. Many human patients who suffer from Alzheimer's disease, dementia and the broad spectrum of
psychosis, including schizophrenia, show various ranges of memory deficits along with the HPC-EC damage.
However, little is known about how specific memories are accessed and formed into meaningful memories to
accomplish given tasks, especially at the systems level. This proposal focuses on the neural dynamics for
successful memory access and retrieval during episodic working memory tasks to elucidate the neural circuit
mechanism in the hippocampal-cortical (HPC-CTX) network. My long-term goal is to elucidate neural dynamics
during psychotic states and to establish novel early-stage diagnostic measurements / analyses in human patients
that are hinted at by in vivo recordings in animal models. I have previously demonstrated two forms of memory
access in the HPC-EC circuits that are crucial during episodic memory tasks. The first form is called `gamma
phase synchrony', which was observed during the running period of a spatial working memory task when the
animal was about to make turns at the junction point of a T-maze. The second form is called an `extended
interregional ripple burst', a memory replay event that is made of alternating chains of burst activities within HPC-
EC network during quiet awake or stopping periods on a large running maze. These two forms of memory access
turned out to be crucial for subsequent spatial working memory behavior. However, the circuit mechanism or
memory contents during these neural activities under different behavioral states are still unknown. Revealing
such memory contents during the memory access period will be crucial to understanding of how exactly our
memory system works. We hypothesize that (i) the content of burst activities between HPC and EC index each
other to retrieve longer episodes as an inter-regional communication during the off-line state and then (ii) the
previously potentiated or activated group of neurons gets briefly activated in gamma phase synchrony during the
active state to successfully execute the memory process. We will test three hypotheses in this proposal by
combining transgenic mouse technology, circuit specific optogenetics, large-scale in vivo electrophysiology, and
a spatial working memory task in mice. The first two specific aims will focus on neural content decoding during
two forms of memory access and the third specific aim will investigate whether the two distinct forms of memory
process have a causal relationship on the successful accession of memory in the HPC-EC network."
10814920,"Project Summary/Abstract
Although KRAS is mutated in 20% of all cancers and 40% of colorectal cancer (CRC), it has long been
considered an “undruggable” target 1. Recently, novel covalent inhibitors selective for KRASG12C have entered
the clinic, offering the unprecedented opportunity to target KRAS directly, and other mutation-specific KRAS
inhibitors (i.e. G12D) are under development 2,3. However, prior efforts to target the RAS-MAPK pathway have
been hampered by adaptive feedback, which drives pathway reactivation and resistance, particularly in CRC.
For example, BRAF inhibition in BRAFV600 CRC leads to loss of ERK-dependent negative feedback and RTK-
mediated pathway reactivation, leading to response rates of only ~5%, compared to ~35% in lung cancer and
>50% in melanoma 4,5. Similarly, while early clinical data with KRASG12C inhibitors show promising response rates
of >35% in lung cancer, response rates in CRC appear much lower (~10%) with limited durability, suggesting a
similar mode of adaptive resistance may be operant in KRASG12C CRC 2,3. In support of this hypothesis, our
preliminary studies have suggested that robust adaptive feedback signals lead to rapid pathway reactivation and
lack of response in KRASG12C CRC models 6. However, prior studies in BRAFV600 CRC—including preclinical and
clinical collaborations between Drs. Corcoran and Kopetz—have demonstrated that combination therapies
targeting adaptive feedback signaling (e.g. EGFR) can improve clinical outcome, with the first such combination
FDA-approved this year (Corcoran et al, Cancer Discovery 2018; Kopetz et al, NEJM, 2019)7-10. Similarly, our
preliminary data support the importance of targeting adaptive feedback in KRASG12C CRC, but suggest complex
feedback signaling that will require strategies beyond targeting EGFR to optimize outcome.
Here, we propose to define the key mechanisms of resistance to KRAS inhibition in CRC and devise therapeutic
strategies to overcome resistance. To accomplish this goal, we propose to leverage a unique collection of ~100
patient-derived CRC organoids and a bank of ~300 CRC PDXs, generated through the MGH/MIT/Broad U54
DRSC and the MDACC U54 PDXNet teams, respectively. We will deploy these novel tools to comprehensively
map the adaptive feedback response to KRASG12C inhibition in vivo using clinically-relevant PDX and patient-
derived organoid xenografts (PDOX) CRC models. In parallel, we will model the evolution of resistance in vivo
to evaluate the potential role of RTK plasticity in driving resistance to specific KRAS inhibitor combinations and
will identify candidate mechanisms of acquired resistance through genomic analysis of serial tumor biopsies and
cfDNA from CRC patients on KRAS inhibitor combination trials. Utilizing this enhanced mechanistic
understanding, we will devise and test novel therapeutic strategies in vivo in our patient-derived models."

 Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) possess the ability to replenish a new functional hematopoietic system in
recipients following transplantation and are the only curative treatment for many hematopoietic malignancies and
disorders. However, the availability of donor human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–matched allogeneic HSCs is often
too low for successful transplantation. Haplotype mismatch (or haploidentical) transplantation, where donors are
matched at half of the HLA loci, is an attractive alternative but is limited by increased rejection, often requiring
high-dose immunosuppression to sustain donor grafts. Current clinical transplantation strategies primarily target
the adaptive immune response, however innate immune cells have recently emerged as key actors in the
allograft response in various transplantation models, contributing to both the success and/or rejection of the
transplant. Thus, better understanding of the innate immune response in transplantation and how to target it, is
critical. We have recently discovered a novel function for the HSC niche molecule Vascular Cell Adhesion
Molecule-1 (VCAM1) on HSCs, in which VCAM1 acts as a “don’t-eat-me” signal for innate immune phagocytes
in the context of haplotype mismatch transplantation. Hence, manipulating VCAM1 expression levels may
represent a promising immuno-regulatory approach to control the activity of innate immune cells promoting
haplotype mismatch engraftment. In our first and second aims, we propose to use mouse models of
transplantation to dissect the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which VCAM1 promotes immune evasion
from phagocytes in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I presentation. In our third aim, we
will assess the impact of engineering VCAM1 expression levels on donor stem cells in promoting engraftment
across the histocompatibility barrier. This proposal will provide valuable insights in the role of MHC-I engagement
in controlling the function of innate immune cells, and illuminate new molecular targets to improve outcomes in
immunologically mismatched stem cell transplantation assays."

Adolescent mental health in the United States has declined precipitously in the past decade. These declines in
mental health have coincided with an increase in social media use, especially as accessed on smartphones.
Because most existing research is correlational, however, it is unclear whether social media use causally
impacts adolescent mental health. We will advance scientific and public knowledge by conducting the first
longitudinal field experiment to examine the causal effects of social media on mental health in 11–14-year-olds.
We propose a basic experiment in which we will recruit 500 adolescents aged 11 to 14, whose parents have
decided to purchase them their first smartphone. Adolescents will be randomly assigned to use their
smartphones without study-imposed restrictions on social media (naturalistic social media condition) or to use
them without access to social media for three months (restricted social media condition). We are focusing on
this population because research shows that most parents buy their children their first smartphones during this
age range and the acquisition of one’s first smartphone is linked to greater exposure to social media. We
hypothesize that adolescents in the naturalistic social media condition will report greater symptoms of anxiety
and depression than adolescents in the restricted social media condition. Our experimental design will also
allow us to provide evidence for the causal impact of social media on key mechanisms, providing targets for
future interventions. We hypothesize that mobile access to social media will affect mental health by (A)
increasing upward social comparison, (B) displacing sleep, physical activity, and in-person social interactions,
and (C) interfering with the quality of in-person social interactions. Going beyond self-report measures of time
spent on social media, we will use passive mobile sensing (EARS tool) to get objective, fine-grained measures
of how adolescents use social media. Evidence shows that active social media (e.g., messaging, posting) use
predicts better mental health, whereas passive social media use (scrolling, browsing) predicts worse mental
health. We hypothesize that adolescents who use social media more actively will have better mental health
outcomes. Finally, recent research suggests that while some people experience negative effects of social
media use, others experience no or even positive effects. Individuals who already struggle to direct and sustain
their attention should be particularly vulnerable to the distracting effects of mobile social media. We
hypothesize that people in the naturalistic social media condition with greater deficits in attention at baseline
will show greater increases in symptoms of anxiety and depression. We will also probe the moderating role of
age, gender, and their interaction. To explore the role of a range of other moderators, we will employ an
exploratory machine-learning approach, which will allow us to explore the intersectionality between multiple
risk factors. In sum, our study will be the first field experiment to causally test whether social media impacts
younger adolescents’ mental health, and if so, why, how, and for whom such effects occur."

evidence that frequent cocaine use is associated with larger HIV latent reservoir size in CD4+ T cells. Low-
level/residual inflammation has been shown to foster a persistent HIV reservoir in CD4+ T cells. However, a major
knowledge gap is whether cocaine exposure supports long-term HIV expression in macrophages and microglia
and whether inflammation mediates this effect. A clear understanding of cocaine’s impact on HIV expression in
complex multicellular contexts is a prerequisite for the identification of novel targets for effective ART regimens,
adjunctive neuroprotective therapies, and latency reversal strategies. Our overarching hypothesis is that long-
term HIV expression in macrophages and microglia contributes to neuropsychiatric damage which is
exacerbated by cocaine. Addressing these key questions requires methods that can determine the identity of
cells that harbor HIV DNA and RNA and simultaneously link the presence of HIV DNA and RNA to functional
cellular outcomes via the transcriptome in the same cell. Proteogenomic approaches that combine DNA and
RNA sequencing with the analysis of surface marker expression to identify cell populations provide insight into
the expression of HIV DNA and RNA in specific CD4+ T cell subtypes. However, significant caveats hinder their
applicability in CNS cells. We will develop a novel molecular, high-resolution, single-cell level method we call
HIV integrated proviral DNA (HID)/single-nuclear RNASeq (HID-Seq). In this combined approach, dCas9-Tn5
tagmentation amplifies proviral DNA integrated in the host genome, and single-nuclear RNASeq uses validated
primer libraries to detect specific HIV RNA species along with the detection of all host-cell RNA species in the
same cell. HIV proviral DNA, HIV RNA, and host-cell RNA are molecularly barcoded using split-sequencing,
which tracks DNA and RNA products to individual cells. In the R61 phase (Aim 1), we will develop HID-Seq for
multilevel indexing of HIV DNA and RNA expression while simultaneously examining the host cell transcriptome
in vitro. In the R33 phase (Aim 2), we will use HID-Seq to determine the impact of cocaine on HIV DNA and
RNA expression in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia and macrophages in vitro (Aim 2a)
and in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CNS cells obtained from autopsy specimens of PWH (Aim
2b-c). Bioinformatic analyses will (i) confirm the identity and characteristics of cells harboring HIV DNA and RNA
in the CNS of PWH with history of cocaine use and (ii) determine how cocaine use alters the associations
between HIV DNA and RNA and host-cell transcriptomic profile."

To survive in the nutrient- and oxygen-deprived niche, cancer cells undergo a drastic metabolic reprogramming
where they upregulate their endogenous lipid synthesis and exogenous lipid uptake. Population-wide mass
spectrometry lipid analyses reveal that amounts of lipid stores, degree of lipid saturation, and acyl-chain length
provide survival advantages by making cells metabolically independent of external sources of energy, protecting
against oxidative stress, and stimulating immune response suppression. Hence, cancer cell lipid profiling
emerges as a powerful diagnostic tool and fundamental research goal. However, current technologies lack
single-cell resolution, do not provide spatial information, and are incapable of linking the cancer cell phenotype
to the lipid composition. Here, we describe a unique platform for simultaneous lipid profiling of multiple cell
types in intact tissue samples at sub-cellular level by probing inherent molecular vibrations using
spectral coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy. It promises transformative information
on how lipid profiles are shaped in different tumor microenvironments (TMEs) in both cancer cells and cancer-
associated cells, and relates this quantitative, spatial information to patterns of protein and gene expression. We
combine a custom, automatically tunable laser system with a commercial confocal microscope to enable
convenient mapping of a range of molecular vibrations to assess (i) amounts of lipids with sub-femtoliter
precision, (ii) degree of lipid unsaturation at single carbon double-bond precision, and (iii) acyl chain
length at single methylene group precision, which can be scaled up by programmable multipoint
measurements of multiple samples.
 Further, by implementing simultaneous single-cell RNA imaging, metabolic profiles can be linked
to upstream RNA transcripts controlling cell metabolism, including known oncogenes. For this purpose, we
will design a series of novel RNA probes, each with an isotope-specific nitrile group, which can be targeted
with high specificity through its distinct molecular vibration by stimulated Raman excited fluorescence (SREF).
Thanks to a multitude of possible combinations for isotope labeling, this innovative approach allows simultaneous
detection of a higher number of RNA transcripts than can be done with current fluorescence-based RNA labeling
techniques without disturbing the lipid landscape. Simultaneously, standard fluorophores can be used to probe
cell-type markers at the protein level with conventional immunocytochemistry. As a result, multiple RNA
transcripts can be mapped simultaneously with lipid profiles and protein profiles for multiple different
cell types. The development will be conducted in collaboration with cancer biologists, cancer metabolism
experts and clinicians, ensuring the biological and clinical relevance of our approach and data analysis."
10814507,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main cause of death in older adults in the US and the burden of aging-
associated CVD is expected to grow as the percentage of the older population steadily grows. A key
characteristic of vascular aging is arterial stiffening, which is a causal factor and independent prognosticator of
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Even though increased arterial stiffness contributes to the
pathogenesis of CVD, the mechanisms underlying arterial stiffening in aging remain poorly understood.
Further, there are currently no treatments available that directly target arterial stiffening. This project
addresses these significant gaps in knowledge. The long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
causing aging-related arterial stiffening that can be therapeutically targeted to prevent the development and/or
reverse the progression of CVD. Arterial stiffening has been attributed to remodeling of the extracellular matrix
of the vascular wall, particularly to increased deposition of adventitial collagen. However, the role of vascular
smooth muscle cell (VSMC) stiffening in the pathogenesis of aging-associated arterial stiffening is increasingly
recognized. Based on rigorous published research and preliminary studies, the central hypothesis of this
project is that VSMC activation of Ras homolog family member A (RhoA)/Rho-associated protein kinase
(ROCK) in aging causes LIM kinase (LIMK)-dependent actin polymerization, stress fiber formation, and
consequent arterial stiffening, an effect that can be reversed by inhibiting sodium glucose co-transporter 2
(SGLT2). A corollary to this hypothesis is that treating older adults with an SGLT2 inhibitor will reduce arterial
stiffness. The hypothesis will be tested using gain- and loss-of-function genetic manipulation and
pharmacological experiments in isolated arteries from younger and older individuals and in cultured VSMC.
Mechanistic studies will be complemented by the first clinical trial to purposely test the efficacy of SGLT2
inhibition in reversing aging-related arterial stiffening. Specifically, studies in Aim 1 will determine the role of
VSMC RhoA/ROCK activation and LIMK-dependent actin polymerization in arterial stiffening in aging, and the
effects of SGLT2 inhibition on this pathway. In Aim 2, the effects of empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, on
arterial stiffness in older individuals will be determined. It is posited that SGLT2 inhibition holds extraordinary
promise for reversing arterial stiffening in older adults, and ultimately ameliorating CVD."
10816394,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The formation of neuronal laminae is a fundamental feature of cortical regions of the mammalian brain. This
proposal aims to generate a defined 3D system of human cerebellar neurons that faithfully reproduces the native
lamination of the cerebellar cortex. The cerebellum is a key area to study, as an archetypal cortical structure and
as a brain region that functions both in sensory-motor control and in non-motor functions, including cognition,
emotion and language. We will use two protocols in place in the Hatten Lab to differentiate the two primary
classes of cerebellar neurons from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and state of the art bioengineering
methods to develop a defined 3D laminar culture system (Aim 1). We will then use calcium imaging of cell-type
specific genetically encoded calcium sensors to determine correlations in neuronal firing rates as a first step
toward recording circuit properties of human cerebellar neurons in a 3D in vitro laminated system (Aim 2) and
transcriptomic profiling against native developing tissue (Aim 3). Among cerebellar interneurons, unipolar brush
cells are important modulators of the cerebellar circuit, yet no protocols are available to derive them in vitro. We
will develop the first differentiation protocols to derive these glutamatergic neurons and incorporate them into
laminar models (Aim 4). This research will combine the expertise of the Millen Lab in human cerebellar
development with that of the Hatten Lab in generating human cerebellar neurons from hPSCs to provide the first
properly stratified human cerebellar circuit for the purposes of disease modeling and drug screening."
10784997,"The proposed NIDCR Dentist Scientist Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) will provide me advanced
research and academic training to become an independent dentist-scientist at the interface of oral microbiology,
biophysics, and spatial omics with impact in Early Childhood Caries (ECC). ECC is a major public health problem
characterized by high microbial carriage forming intractable plaque-biofilms on teeth exposed to sugar-laden
dietary habits. The disease leads to rampant tooth-decay, is costly to treat and can cause systemic complications
in children. Previous studies and a recent multi-omics analysis of dental plaque from two large community-based
cohorts of pre-school children (>400) have identified Selenomonas sputigena (Ss), a motile bacterium, to be
strongly associated with ECC. This finding was further validated in an in vivo caries model whereby Ss
exacerbated the severity of carious lesions when co-infected with Streptococcus mutans (Sm). However, the
role of Ss and its motility on biofilm formation, interspecies interaction with Sm, and cariogenic functions are
unknown. To address this, I will focus on the overall hypothesis that the motile Ss colonizes tooth surface and
interacts with Sm to mediate biofilm spatial structuring and community functions that promote emergent caries-
causing properties of supragingival biofilms through three Aims: (1) Characterize Ss motility on surface
colonization and biofilm initiation; (2) Determine the dynamics of biofilm assembly, spatial transcriptomics and
disease-associated functions; (3) Investigate Ss-mediated colonization, interspecies spatial structuring/omics
and biofilm virulence in vivo. The outcome will elucidate the role of Ss and its motility in supragingival biofilm
formation and Ss contributions to the etiopathogenesis of ECC. During the K99 mentored phase, I will conduct
research in the lab of my primary mentor/co-mentor, while developing key expertise in 3 areas: 1) advanced
skills in biophysical methods to study motile bacteria; 2) acquiring knowledge and technical skills in single-cell
RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics; 3) improving scientific communication and grant writing skills. In
addition, I will incorporate mentoring and laboratory managing skills as well as networking. In transition to
independent R00 phase, I will implement and complete the spatial transcriptomics studies to understand how
Ss influence biofilm interspecies interactions and determine its pathogenic role in dental caries in vivo. The data
will provide ample opportunities for further mechanistic studies and targeted strategies for ECC. In addition, it
will provide a platform to study other motile oral bacteria in health and disease, which remain understudied.
Collectively, the proposal will broaden my vision and skills by capitalizing on highly experienced mentor and co-
mentor with an interdisciplinary advisory committee with complementary expertise in biophysics, spatial multi-
omics, oral microbiome, and clinical research. I will gain essential knowledge, skills, and experience to build my
own research program with the goal of receiving an R01 prior to the end of award, and successfully guide me to
pursue independent dentist-scientist career in oral microbiology and cariology with multidisciplinary vision."

10821390,"Abstract
The cardiac myocyte has long been the primary focus of studies attempting to elucidate the
regulatory aspects underlying cardiac development and disease. However, recently the
involvement of nonmyocytes has emerged as potentially just as important as myocytes in
contributing to and controlling cardiac remodeling during progressive pathogenesis associated
with heart failure. More specifically, the cardiac fibroblast and its ability to convert to
myofibroblasts in promoting extracellular matrix (ECM) production, ventricular remodeling and the
fibrotic response is now viewed as an equally critical regulator of cardiac biology. Here we will
address how fibroblasts in the heart function as key determinants of disease and pathologic
remodeling. We have developed important genetic tools that specifically target the fibroblast in
the heart so that we can manipulate the activity of these cells. Thus, here we can now test the
novel hypothesis that activated fibroblasts (myofibroblasts) are critical regulators of cardiac
disease processes, not only involving fibrosis but also the ability of cardiomyocytes in the heart
to properly hypertrophy. We will test the more specific hypothesis that fibroblasts regulate the
density and integrity of the cardiac ECM and collagen that cardiomyocytes must sense as
increased structural support in order to effectively hypertrophy in vivo. Indeed, we further
hypothesize that the tension sensing mechanism within the cardiomyocyte extends outward to
the ECM and its integrity or stiffness. This application has 3 specific aims: 1) To increase the
structural rigor of collagen in the heart to investigate the impact on cardiomyocyte hypertrophic
growth potential in vivo, 2) To genetically impair type I collagen formation in the heart to reduce
ECM structural rigor, and 3) To examine the actin filamentous network as a central signaling
mechanism whereby ECM integrity or stiffness impacts myocyte growth in vivo. Collectively,
these specific aims will uncover how fibroblasts communicate with cardiomyocytes in the heart
through the ECM and its properties. Such an understanding will lay the foundation for future
studies into specific therapeutic targets in treating longstanding fibrotic heart disease states or
hypertrophy in general."
10819738,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Over 6 million Americans currently live with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and this number is projected
to increase to 16 million by 2050. The consensus is arising in the field that in order to treat AD
effectively, early detection at the MCI stage is a must. Thus, there is a critical need for a novel
minimally invasive and cost-effective diagnostic assay capable of such early detection. Cell-secreted
extracellular vesicles (EVs) recently gained significant attention in the fields of liquid biopsy and AD
research. Within the scope of biomarker detection, EVs offer numerous benefits for clinical analysis,
including non-invasive collection, a suitable sample source for longitudinal disease monitoring, ability
to cross the blood-brain barrier, higher stability and sample volumes, faster processing times and
lower cost. Multiple reports linked EVs to neurodegeneration and have been able to couple exosome
load in CSF to AD progression. However, the analysis of plasma exosomes and other EV has not
really been possible for early AD detection. The procedures for plasma biomarker analysis are very
long and cumbersome due to extremely low target levels and high background of free plasma
proteins. In order to enable better biomarker discovery and AD diagnosis, a more reliable and
efficient approach is needed, capable of enriching potential AD-associated proteins with higher purity.
In the NIH SBIR Phase I portion of this study, we have developed a novel method for fast and
reproducible capture and isolation of EVs with >95% recovery yield and >99.9% purity from plasma
samples. We then implemented this EV capture approach to discover novel potential AD markers in
plasma EVs with, which showed a clear and consistent differentiation from non-AD samples. In the
Phase II portion of this project, we propose to validate our discovered protein biomarkers in a much
larger cohort and translate the new marker panel into a clinically relevant ELISA format for the
intended clinical use of early screening and AD/ADRD progression monitoring. The following aims
will be completed in the Phase II of the proposal: Aim #1: Validate the discovered plasma EV
biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease and refine the panel. Aim #2: Carry out analytical evaluation and
validate the EXrich instrument for automated EV enrichment. Aim #3: Adapt the developed plasma
EV biomarker panel into a clinically relevant ELISA format. By the completion of this project, a
minimally invasive plasma-based early Alzheimer's disease detection assay will be validated that can
overcome the limitations of current approaches, and thus could have an enormous public health
impact and market potential."
10819880,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Thrombosis, often at unusual sites such as splanchnic vein and arteries, is a common complication and one of
the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).
Developing effective therapies for thrombosis in MPNs is in its infancy. Current first-line therapy of chronic
phase MPNs includes aspirin, hydroxyurea, interferon a, or anagrelide. However, these treatment approaches
remain suboptimal with ongoing risks for thrombosis, hemorrhage, and impaired quality of life. Targeted
molecular therapy in this stage of MPNs for thrombosis is also lacking. Aplexis, Inc is a startup company
focusing on the development of new approaches to treat thrombosis in the chronic phase of MPNs, especially
targeting the downstream effectors of the JAK2 pathway that is commonly activated in these disorders. One of
these effectors is Pleckstrin-2 (Plek2) that is a novel target of the JAK2-STAT5 pathway. Previous studies have
shown that loss of Plek2 ameliorated JAK2V617F mutant-induced myeloproliferative phenotypes, and reverted
thrombosis and lethality of the JAK2V617F MPN mouse model. Importantly, Plek2 is overexpressed in the bone
marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from JAK2V617F positive chronic MPN patients. Given the
significance of Plek2 in thrombosis pathogenesis in MPNs, Aplexis has been collaborating with Ji laboratory at
Northwestern University and has identified hit compounds of Plek2 small molecule inhibitors using in silico-
based high-throughput screening and cell-based assays. With the support of the Phase I SBIR grant, Aplexis
achieved another milestone by developing a lead compound APX-052 with potent efficacies and safety
profiles. Mechanistic studies further revealed that APX-052 binds to Plek2 and disrupts Plek2-Akt interaction,
which reduces Akt activation and inhibits cell proliferation. The goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to
determine the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of APX-052 and test it in various in vivo MPN models. We will also
initiate IND-enabling studies and conduct a pre-IND briefing with FDA. Aplexis has a strong support from
Northwestern University’s Innovation and New Ventures Office (INVO) on an exclusive license for the
associated patent-pending intellectual property from this technology. The collaboration with the Ji laboratory at
Northwestern University will ensure the success of the proposed research, which will position Aplexis to the
next step in the production of clinical candidate of Plek2 inhibitors."
10824430,"COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT
ABSTRACT
A core mission of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC) is to reduce the burden of cancer
in its catchment area of Los Angeles County (LAC) and beyond. LAC is the most populous and diverse county in
the US, and a signature example of a majority minority community. Over 70% of LAC’s 10.2 million residents are
from racial/ethnic minority groups, 45% are immigrants, and 57% speak a language other than English at
home. The cancer burden in the county is high, with large differences in cancer risk factors and cancer outcomes
by ethnicity, gender, and socio-economic indicators. Given the immense socio-economic and racial/ethnic
diversity of the catchment area, the Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) goals are to ensure that the
research, outreach and other strategic activities of the JCCC are collectively responsive to the cancer burden
and needs of LAC residents, with particular attention to addressing and ameliorating cancer-related disparities.
These goals are being advanced through three broad COE specific aims. In Aim 1, the COE monitors the cancer
burden and cancer-related needs in LAC. This includes monitoring cancer outcomes such as incidence,
mortality, survival, and stage at diagnosis as well as cancer risk factors, cancer screening, preventive vaccine
uptake, and receipt of appropriate cancer care. Patterns and trends are examined by race/ethnicity,
age, immigrant status, socio-economic characteristics, insurance status, and geographic location. This
information is regularly shared with JCCC leaders and members as well as community representatives to inform
JCCC research, community engagement, and other strategic initiatives. In Aim 2, the COE promotes JCCC
basic, clinical, and population research that spans the continuum from primary prevention through end-of-life
and is relevant to the cancer burden and needs of LAC residents. An emphasis is placed on research focused
on the most prevalent cancers in LAC as well as cancers that disproportionately affect marginalized groups. The
COE promotes the inclusion of diverse populations in all JCCC research and clinical trials. It also prioritizes and
supports research beyond the catchment area as well as global cancer research conducted by members. In Aim
3, the COE conducts and supports a wide range of cancer-related outreach and engagement activities
throughout LAC and adjacent counties with an emphasis on vulnerable population groups. Activities aim to
disseminate basic cancer information and recent scientific advances to diverse county residents through
partnerships with numerous community organizations and coalitions. The COE also strives to enhance
enrollment of racial/ethnic minority community members in clinical trials. In addition, significant efforts are made
to increase the capacity of community organizations to partner in cancer-related research. LAC is the archetypal
microcosm of our nation’s increasingly diverse future. This provides the JCCC with an unusual opportunity
to play a critical role in shaping our national response to addressing the cancer-related needs of our
diverse communities, with lessons that can ultimately help reduce the cancer burden nationally and globally."
10824434,"DEVELOPMENTAL FUNDS
ABSTRACT
Developmental Funds are an essential component of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC)
total resource package that Center leadership allocates for strategic imperatives to bolster high priority science
and support the Center mission of accelerating discoveries to prevent and cure cancer.
Use of CCSG Developmental Funds targets priorities identified in the 2019 – 2023 JCCC Strategic Plan,
leveraging combinations of additional resources obtained from philanthropy, foundations, UCLA schools and
departments, and UCLA Health. Funds deployed for Center development initiatives that originate from the CCSG
and other sources support multiple activities that enhance impactful JCCC research in its Los Angeles County
catchment area and beyond. These deployments include funds for research faculty recruitment, for innovative
transdisciplinary research through the competitive JCCC Intramural Awards Program, and for key initiatives,
such as development of interventional early phase clinical research studies in identified high priority areas, or to
enhance health care access and reduce disparities for Los Angeles County residents.
To maximize the impact that leveraged Developmental Funds have on the Center and the community it serves,
the JCCC embraces two overarching specific aims. Aim 1 is to support cutting-edge cancer research as
prioritized by the 2019 – 2023 JCCC Strategic Plan through added resourcing of the competitive JCCC Intramural
Awards Program. Supported strategic goals include development of highly innovative interventional early phase
clinical studies in multiple tumor types informed through Center community outreach and engagement activities
that identify top community needs. Aim 2 is to leverage non-CCSG sources of support to fund additional
intramural awards and to support recruitment and retention of faculty in areas elevated by the Center Strategic
Plan. Areas identified as priorities include expanding clinical research and increasing inclusion of underserved
populations, continuing to strengthen the JCCC Oncology Clinical Trials Network, initiatives focused on obesity
and metabolism, translational theranostics, and cancer immunotherapy, as well as a focus on cancer biophysics
and device commercialization."
10824435,"LEADERSHIP, PLANNING AND EVALUATION
ABSTRACT
Under strong new leadership from the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC) Director, Michael
Teitell, MD, PhD (CMINT), a fresh, thorough, and prioritized JCCC strategic plan details a practical Center
mission, to accelerate discoveries that prevent and cure cancer. A new JCCC leadership team infused
enthusiasm into a Center culture that strives to eradicate cancer in LAC, the nation, and the world through
impactful research as an aspirational vision. Driving mission success is a series of exciting and achievable goals
for the next five-year project period and beyond. The JCCC 2019 – 2023 Strategic Plan maps out a new
governance structure, increased institutional support that includes participation in a pending centralized funds
distribution mechanism, research priorities, patient-centered care initiatives, and addresses all 2013 CCSG study
section comments. Significant enthusiasm emanates from increased organizational and financial commitments
by new leaders in UCLA Health Sciences and an unprecedented organizational structure that elevates the JCCC
role in fully integrating cancer research and clinical care at UCLA. This governance structure provides the
infrastructure to support innovative and impactful basic, translational, clinical, and population science research,
with strengthened community engagement to serve, and benefit from, a diverse Los Angeles County (LAC)
JCCC catchment area. Adaptability helps the JCCC achieve its ambitious mission with continuous evaluation
and planning activities, periodic evaluations by a reformulated External Advisory Board (EAB), focused ad-hoc
reviews from consultants, and frequent opportunities for input from the breadth of the JCCC membership.
Working with Teitell to drive forward Center progress is a 12-member senior leadership team, with each member
having defined areas of expertise, oversight, and responsibility. JCCC leadership, planning, and evaluation
occurs through four independent but related specific aims. Aim 1 is to plan, set, and implement JCCC scientific
goals and mission through the Strategic Plan, with ongoing evaluation of progress and corrective actions, to
maximize basic, translational, clinical, and population research, emphasizing LAC catchment area needs. Aim 2
is to enlist the JCCC EAB and ad-hoc experts to evaluate progress and identify growth opportunities that enhance
cancer research productivity, education, training, and mentoring, and community outreach and engagement
activities. Aim 3 is to guide and foster impactful JCCC collaborative and transdisciplinary research through
prioritized resource allocation. Aim 4 is to facilitate Center-wide communications amongst Senior Leaders,
Program Directors, Shared Resource Directors, members, trainees, and staff to guide the development and
growth of the JCCC. With the vision of a new Director, there is excitement to build on historic strengths of the
JCCC with a fresh focus on patient-centered integration of research, education/training, clinical care, and
community engagement in the uniquely diverse setting of LAC. With this inflection point in the Center’s strategic
trajectory, the JCCC of the near future will have added new heights to its very strong and impactful foundation."
10824438,"CLINICAL PROTOCOL AND DATA MANAGEMENT (CPDM)
ABSTRACT
Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) is led by Dennis Slamon, MD, PhD (STT), UCLA Jonsson
Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC) Associate Director for Clinical/Translational Research. CPDM functions
reside fully within the JCCC Clinical Research Unit (CRU) under the direct authority of JCCC Director, Michael
Teitell, MD, PhD (CMINT). The overarching objective of the CRU and its specific goals are to ensure access to
clinical trials for oncology patients throughout the JCCC catchment area, Los Angeles County (LAC), and
beyond, to further the science of clinical/translational oncology, and to provide new and effective FDA-approved
therapies for widespread use. The CRU provides the necessary infrastructure to execute important and impactful
clinical/translational studies. A strong relationship between the JCCC Director and UCLA research leadership
enables the Center to establish the highest standards for oncology research. The CRU, led by Meghan Brennan,
RN, MSN, ONP, PhD, JCCC Senior Director for Oncology Clinical Research, serves all UCLA/JCCC faculty
conducting cancer-related clinical research. With 240 staff members supporting more than 60 principal
investigators, the CRU oversees and manages more than 500 interventional trials annually. The CRU has
centralized support functions for protocol development, regulatory submission to federal and institutional entities,
study activation and execution, data and safety reporting, monitoring, auditing, and regulatory compliance. The
JCCC, through the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) and the CRU Office of Regulatory Compliance
(ORC), provides oversight, data, and safety evaluations for interventional institutional trials. The JCCC ensures
that all clinical trials design is with scientific integrity, having clinical and scientific relevance, addressing safety
issues, and with performance according to state, federal, and institutional policies. Furthermore, the JCCC
applies these standards to all clinical research, from both internal and external sponsors.
Under Teitell, JCCC clinical/translational science and the CRU have grown and undergone transformational
changes in a short period. Working together with Slamon and Brennan, Teitell quickly identified challenges and
the potential for new opportunities influencing trial accrual performance and inclusion. Immediately, Teitell
secured ~$1.8 M in additional institutional funding to develop and support new inclusion initiatives, update and
augment the CRU infrastructure, and add more centralized programs for JCCC members. In the next project
period, the expansion of JCCC clinical research activity with a focus on inclusion and accrual of women,
minorities, children, and underserved populations in LAC and beyond are the highest priorities for Brennan and
Slamon. The JCCC has invested substantially in a more comprehensive inclusion program through four new
diversity initiatives in its catchment area, including the Burbank Gynecology Oncology Initiative, the Van Nuys
Breast Cancer Program, the Olive View Medical Center (OVMC) Program, and Miller Children’s and Women’s
Hospital Long Beach Partnership."
10824439,"PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM (PRMS)
ABSTRACT
The objective of the JCCC Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) is to ensure that all UCLA clinical
cancer studies apply sound scientific approaches to produce meaningful results for the JCCC, cancer and
scientific communities, providers, and most importantly for patients in and around the JCCC catchment area,
Los Angeles County (LAC). Under the purview of the JCCC Director, Michael Teitell, MD, PhD (CMINT), the
PRMS has oversight of all oncology-related clinical research conducted at UCLA. This oversight includes
interventional, non-interventional, and some more basic science cancer studies. The PRMS performs rigorous
scientific review of studies involving human subjects or specimens, including, but not limited to, treatment,
prevention, diagnosis, screening, and other interventions. The PRMS works to assure that clinical studies are
appropriately prioritized and utilize available JCCC resources and guidance efficiently.
Over the prior project period, JCCC leadership revised the PRMS structure and functions. The core of the PRMS
remains the Internal Scientific Peer Review Committee (ISPRC), under the authority of the JCCC, established
in 1993. The ISPRC serves as the JCCC protocol review and monitoring committee (PRMC). As part of the
reorganization of the PRMS, in further alignment with NCI-guidelines and meeting the needs of JCCC
investigators, the newly appointed Director of PRMS, John Glaspy, MD, MPH (STT), established a two-stage
review process for all JCCC institutional interventional trials. This process involves a new committee, the
Institutional Protocol Committee (IPC), which conducts an initial review of JCCC institutional trial concepts or
protocols prior to ISPRC submission. Only studies that receive IPC approval move forward for review by the
ISPRC. This process began in early 2019 as a pilot looking at the completeness, efficiency, and quality of study
submissions to the ISPRC. Once submitted to the ISPRC, members review the research protocol and associated
scientific approaches, statistical approaches, patient populations, and JCCC resources required for study
execution including staffing, expertise, clinical research facilities, and any necessary infrastructure. Of equal
importance is ISPRC review of on-going interventional trials to ensure study progress, appropriate execution,
and timely patient accrual to meet study endpoints. As part of study progress review, the continued scientific
contribution of the clinical trial is also considered. The ISPRC may request ad-hoc reviews of trials or researchers
based upon reports or identified issues related to trial execution according to the protocol and regulations, which
may possibly nullify data, results, and ultimately scientific contribution. The PRMS provides complimentary and
necessary, but non-overlapping, functions to the institutional review board (IRB)."
10821689,"Abstract: SNYTHETIC EGG:SPERM FUSION ASSAY: A DIAGNOSTIC TEST FOR MALE FERTILITY
 The establishment of PS-Fertility, C-Corp was motivated by: 1) our recent findings from the laboratory that
phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of viable sperm is necessary for sperm:egg fusion; 2) that sperm can
fuse with myoblast cells in a PS-dependent manner; and 3) the inability of conventional semen analysis assays
to provide meaningful information about sperm function. Our overall goal of this SBIR is to refine our simple rapid
synthetic egg:sperm fusion assay and further develop our business model. The fusion assay will serve as a
surrogate assay for sperm:egg fusion, to quantify the fusogenic fertilization-competent sperm in an ejaculate.
 Clinicians view semen analysis as a perfunctory assay, rather than an insightful test to acquire information
toward improved assisted reproductive technique strategies. Our market research, performed as part of the NSF
I-Corps program, revealed that, overwhelmingly, clinicians would welcome a diagnostic tool that could provide
new information about male infertility, specifically sperm health/function.
 The premise for this application stems our preliminary studies, where we find an unexpected exposure of the
lipid phosphatidylserine (PS), which is normally associated with apoptotic cells, on the surface of viable and
motile sperm. Further, PS recognition receptors are expressed on the oocytes, and blocking/loss of some of
these receptors impairs fertilization.
 In this Phase 1 SBIR application, we will further develop our synthetic egg:sperm fusion assay (SEFA) that
will test the fusion (fertilization) competency of sperm cells. To our knowledge, there are no semen analysis tests
that provide information about the potential ability of a sperm to fertilize an egg. In Aim 1 we will demonstrate
the feasibility of better quantifying male infertility though a new fertility kit and in Aim 2 we will perform a
pilot study to evaluate the use of the new kit with a larger cohort of real-world samples.
 Development of this male fertility test `SEFA' will provide fertility experts and thus patients with information
about male fertility that is currently not available from any other diagnostic. This information will aid in
personalizing fertility treatments and reducing emotional and economic costs."

For this proposal we intend to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel immunotherapeutic vaccine to prevent
and possibly treat Human T cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) associated diseases. HTLV-1 is a human
retrovirus that is the causative agent of a malignant T CD4+ cell lymphoproliferative disorder referred to as adult
T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), as well as several inflammatory disorders with the most problematic being
HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HTLV-1 infection is endemic in many
areas around the world including southern Japan, the southern United States, central Australia, the Caribbean,
South America, equatorial Africa, and the middle East. Over 10 million people may be infected worldwide. It is
estimated that approximately 5% of HTLV-1 positive individuals will develop ATLL, and 2% HAM/TSP.
Seropositive rates in certain areas reach 20–40% among people aged over 50 years. HTLV-1 is also a major
problem in southern Florida communities and remarkably, there are no effective vaccine or treatment
options to prevent HAM/TSP or ATLL afflicted individuals. Given this, aim to develop and test the efficacy of
a novel vaccine/immunotherapeutic to prevent HTLV1-mediated disease. For this proposal, and through our
previous STTR award (Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus GMP Vaccine Development; R41AI 165061), we
are happy to report that we have now successfully GMP manufactured vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)
with the VSV glycoprotein (G) substituted for the HTLV1 glycoprotein gp62. We have also designed our
vaccine to express two defective, regulatory HTLV-1 proteins (HBZ and TAX). We aim to confirm that our
candidate vaccine, referred to as (VSV-gp62-∆HT) generates neutralizing antibodies to the glycoprotein, as well
as cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) to gp62, TAX and HBZ (as we effectively demonstrate in murine models, data
enclosed herein).
Aim 1: To evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and clinical activity of VSV-gp62-∆HT in healthy, HTLV-1 infected
individuals at low dose inoculation (1 x 106 PFU x 3). Interim safety analysis will be performed, and detection of
recombinant viral vectors determined, post inoculation (by plaque assay and RT-PCR). The ability of VSV-gp62-
∆HT to generate neutralizing antibodies to the glycoprotein will also be analyzed, as well as the production of
cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) to gp62, TAX and HBZ and the vaccine’s impact on HTLV-1 proviral loads.
Aim 2: Should we achieve the first aim, we will perform a second stage analysis at a higher dose (1 x 107 and
plausibly 1 x 108 PFU x 3) and compare whether we observe an increases in neutralizing antibody to gp62 and/or
CTL activity to gp62, HBZ and/or TAX. We will also monitor safety and viremia, as above. Our objectives are to
collate sufficient information to warrant the consideration of utilizing VSV-gp62-∆HT in putative Phase II trials to
prevent HTLV1-associated malaise, such as HAM/TSP and ATLL."

The overall goal of this grant is to continue supporting the multidisciplinary Scientific Research Network on
Decision Neuroscience and Aging. The integrative emerging area that this grant will support combines the
strengths of several fields including psychology, neuroscience/neurology, medicine and economics to facilitate
rapid scientific progress and directly contribute to the development of effective interventions and policies to
improve health and well being across the life span and reduce the burden of Alzheimer’s Disease and related
dementias (ADRD). After ten years of establishing this network, the next five years will be focused on
strengthening the link between basic research on decision making and aging and clinical research on decision
making and ADRD. This will involve growing the network participation to include emerging scientists interested
in ADRD as well as expanding our advisory board to include ADRD experts. Over five years this network grant
will support scientific meetings, intensive training workshops for researchers at all stages, collaboration and
mentorship initiatives, and pilot grant competitions for researchers new to the field. These activities will directly
support the growth, development, and sustainability of the decision neuroscience of aging. This grant will
support growth of the network through dissemination activities. Scientific meetings will increase awareness of
the latest findings with the goal of drawing new researchers into the area and encouraging new collaborations.
A small grant competition will encourage scientists to join the area and will stimulate new research through
small scale pilots. This network grant will support development of the area through methods workshops and an
outside mentorship program. Short, intensive workshops will focus on training researchers at all stages in the
collection and analysis of various emerging behavioral and biological measures and introduce investigators to
new research areas to expand the scope of their own work and build new collaboration opportunities (e.g.,
clinical ADRD science for decision making researchers; decision neuroscience for clinicians). The development
of these skills is currently difficult to achieve in traditional single discipline training programs, but will be
essential for taking advantage of the growing number of large multivariate and multi-level integrative datasets
generated by this type of research, especially prevalent in ADRD research. The network will focus on investing
in the sustainability of this field by ensuring that students, fellows, and faculty are invited to participate in all
activities. Workshops, meetings, small pilot grants, and collaboration initiatives will facilitate the transition from
the current growing group of individuals managing network activities to a strong field of researchers leading
future work in this area. After completion of activities, this emerging area will be in better position for network
members to pursue funding to support the network in the future using more traditional mechanisms."

10824286,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), a common brain injury from loss of oxygen and
nutrients immediately prior to birth, results in long-term neurologic deficits even in the absence of significant
perinatal cell death. A major gap in the perinatal injury field is the limited mechanistic understanding of how
transient hypoxia results in persistent cellular deficits. A compelling mechanism linking prenatal hypoxia to
persistent deficits is that prenatal hypoxia permanently alters the epigenome because the epigenome integrates
development with response to the environment.
 To study the mechanisms underlying the pathology of HIE, I developed a novel mouse model of transient
late gestation prenatal hypoxic injury that phenocopies mild HIE. Prenatal hypoxia leads to persistent behavioral
and structural deficits in adult mice despite no significant increase in cell death in the fetal brain. My preliminary
data showed decrease in dendritic spine density in corticothalamic neurons at postnatal day 28 (P28), weeks
after hypoxia. Prenatal hypoxia was associated with upregulation of genes associated with the epigenome in
single nucleus RNA and assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (snRNA/ATAC-seq) in the fetal
neocortex within one hour of exposure. One of the most upregulated genes, the histone variant H3f3b, is a
candidate for protecting the brain from more severe brain injury. However, the epigenetic trajectories of
corticothalamic neurons seemed to be shifted even immediately after hypoxic exposure. Therefore, my central
hypothesis is that H3f3b upregulation is necessary and sufficient to protect neurons from severe injury
after prenatal hypoxia and distinct epigenetic regulators contribute to lasting neuronal injury.
 To test my hypothesis, I propose three aims. In Aim 1, I will use conditional knockout mice to test if H3f3b
depletion increases cell death immediately after hypoxia and worsens the persistent deficits in spine density in
P28 mice and behaviors in adult mice. In Aim 2, I will use in utero electroporation to test if overexpression of
H3f3b improves deficits from hypoxia in spine density in P28 mice and behaviors in adult mice. Lastly, in Aim 3,
I propose to use snRNA/ATAC-seq in the cortex of P28 mice to determine if prenatal hypoxia has a permanent
effect on the epigenome of corticothalamic neurons.
 My long-term goal is to be a child neurologist who leverages my research expertise in molecular biology
and clinical skills in perinatal brain injury both to develop targeted therapies towards this frequently devastating
injury. My mentors, Drs. Eric Marsh and Michal Elovitz, are excellent physician scientists devoted to using
translational research to improving outcomes in children with neurological disorders. Under their guidance for
this K08 proposal, I will gain additional skills in bioinformatics, a deeper expertise in translational animal studies,
and lab management skills necessary to become an expert in the epigenetics of neurological disorders and be
prepared for a career as an independent R01-funded physician scientist."
10825315,"PROJECT SUMMARY
lgG perform immunomodulatory signaling via lgG Fe-Fey receptor (FcyR) interactions that trigger different
effector functions according to the balance of activating to inhibitory (A/I) signals. Non-neutralizing, FcyR-
mediated effector functions can be critical for optimal protection in many infectious diseases, including both
influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2. Studies over the past decade have shown tremendous heterogeneity in
lgG Fe domains across individuals, with Fe domain structure (both protein and glycan components) being
one key determinant of effector functions that are engaged during an infection. Yet, it is clear from clinical
studies showing variable efficacy of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapeutics with homogenous Fe
domains that Fe domain
structure is not the sole determinant of antibody effector function in vivo. The functional capacity of effector
cells is almost certainly a critical determinant of lgG activity in vivo, but this has not been defined. This
proposal addresses key unanswered questions in immunity mediated by broad, FcyR-dependent antibodies
against influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2: 1) how much heterogeneity exists in the functional capacity
of human
effector cells and is function altered by influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2 vaccination or infection, 2) how do
obesity and diabetes - states that confer high risk during influenza virus or SARS-CoV-2 infections - impact
effector cell function 3) can the functional capacity of hypo- or hyperresponsive effector cells be ""tuned"" using
lgG engineering strategies. We will address these questions in experiments that include key collaborations
with Project 2 (Barnes), Project 3 (Khatri) and the Technology Project (Davis). Designed immunogen baits via
Project 2 will be used to pull out broadly reactive, anti-influenza and SARS-CoV-2 lgG from polyclonal
antisera to study the effector functions recruited by these antibodies. Effector cells will furthermore be
subject to transcriptomics before and after treatment with lgG immune complexes to define correlates for
responses through collaboration with Project 3. In collaboration with the Technology Project we will use
spleen, tonsil, and lung organoids to test the hypothesis that effector cell functions can be ""tuned"" using
engineered lgG immune complexes. Finally, to follow up on our observation from humans that effector cell
function is heterogeneous across individuals, we will use different collaborative cross mouse strains to test
the hypothesis that the ability of broad, non-neutralizing anti-influenza mAbs to protect is correlated with the
functional capacity of their effector cells (collaboration between Dr. Taia Wang and Dr. David Schneider).
Collectively, this work, alongside the other projects proposed, helps to establish a rigorous immunological
foundation for factors underlying protection against influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2."
10824288,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Every year, more than 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke, with currently around 4.7 million
survivors. Approximately 20% of survivors develop vascular contributions to cognitive impairments and dementia
(VCID) which is second only to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). While several putative biomarkers are known, a
considerable gap exists in stroke research in terms of validation and interaction of biomarkers of VCID. There is
a critical need to better understand the complex interactions of VCID risk factors, baseline cognitive and brain
health, and incident stroke lesion burden on post stroke brain changes and subsequent development of VCID.
The specific aims of this project will address this need innovatively by (1) utilizing a novel neighborhood
disadvantage atlas to geo-spatially map and quantify socio-economic disadvantage, (2) quantifying vascular risk
burden, (3) incorporating baseline brain and cognitive health, (4) leveraging technical advances in state-of-the-
art connectome MRI, and (5) applying network neuroscience and machine learning. In addition, we will recruit
participants from underrepresented minority groups (African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans),
rural/urban, low/high SES who might be at increased risk for VCID. Our central hypothesis is that VCID risk
factors, baseline cognitive and brain health, incident stroke damage, and post stroke brain changes will
act in concert through brain perfusion, structure, and connectivity pathways in determining whether a
stroke patient develops VCID. We will collect longitudinal connectome MRI and Neuropsychological data from
a prospective cohort of patients 55-90 years old with incident ischemic stroke in the left (n=50) or right (n=50)
middle cerebral artery territory. We will prospectively collect data on n=50 and retrospectively use n=100 from
AD connectome project for matched healthy controls. Aim 1 (Brain changes): Characterize how the interaction
of VCID risk factors (e.g., cardiovascular, demographics), baseline brain health and the extent of incident stroke
damage will affect post stroke brain changes at 6 months. Aim 2 (Brain-cognition relationships): Characterize
specific relationships between VCID risk factors, baseline cognition, brain, incident stroke, post stroke brain
changes and post stroke cognitive function at 6 and 12-months across 5 cognitive domains including executive
function, attention, language, memory and visuospatial. We will use advanced machine learning to build
predictive models that will identify contributory and deleterious brain changes associated with post stroke
cognitive outcomes. Successful completion of the project will provide currently lacking scientific understanding
of the intricate biological relationships between VCID risk factors, stroke MRI biomarkers, and their interactions,
that underlie the biology of cognitive outcomes after an ischemic stroke. The results will lay a strong foundation
for building accurate diagnosis, prognosis, disease monitoring tools, and future clinical studies that can aid in
positively altering disease progression and reducing illness burden on patients due to post ischemic stroke VCID."
10824293,"SUMMARY
Diet is a critical factor in the development of metabolic diseases, but dietary factors affect disease risk differently
across individuals. Gene-diet interactions (GxDs) can help resolve this inter-individual variability in diet response
by identifying genetic variants that modify the association between dietary behaviors and metabolic risk factors
(e.g., glycemic traits and waist circumference). Identifying many such interactions would enable genome-guided
precision nutrition recommendations (e.g., Mediterranean-style diet (MedDiet) vs. lower-fat dietary pattern to
decrease diabetes risk). However, imprecision and bias in self-reported dietary behaviors as well as small
variant-specific effects have largely impeded the identification of robust GxD interactions. These two key
obstacles can be addressed by using techniques from nutritional epidemiology and genomics to improve GxD
identification. Specifically, diet measurement can be improved by incorporating (1) longitudinal diet
measurements for more stable intake estimates and (2) objective metabolomic proxies for diet to complement
self-reported data. The problem of small effect sizes can be improved by adapting the polygenic risk score (PRS)
approach to create polygenic interaction scores (iPRS) that combine interaction effects across many variants.
These strategies can be explored in the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) cohorts, which have
self-reported diet at multiple timepoints and serum metabolomics. The MedDiet is a well-suited exposure with
which to explore these approaches: it is commonly consumed, impacts metabolic disease risk, has evidence of
GxD interactions, and has a validated metabolomic signature. The hypothesis to be explored is that improved
dietary measurement approaches and iPRS will allow replication of known and discovery of novel GxDs. The
principal investigator, Dr. Kenneth Westerman, Ph.D., is uniquely positioned to complete this work as an early-
career scientist with a nutrition background, expertise in GxD analysis, and prior experience with TOPMed dietary
data. He requires additional training to address current skill gaps in longitudinal data analysis, metabolomics,
PRS, and leadership, facilitating the completion of the following research aims. Aim 1: To improve the
reproducibility of standard gene-diet interaction models for metabolic risk factors by combining longitudinal
measurements and metabolomic dietary proxies. Aim 2: To improve upon standard PRS for interaction testing
by developing a polygenic score method that aggregates over genetic interaction effects Aim 3: To discover
novel genetic factors modifying the association between a Mediterranean-style diet and metabolic risk factors.
The proposed research will validate improved dietary modeling methods for GxD studies and create genetic
scores that predict diet response. The associated training will help Dr. Westerman achieve independence in the
field of precision nutrition and explore these ideas further in dietary trials in future grants."
10824294,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Understanding cellular processes and pathways in depth requires methods that not only investigate the
composition and arrangement of various protein assemblies, but that also elucidate their dynamics and
functional regulation. Experimental strategies delivering structural information beyond primary sequence; i.e.,
higher-order structure and protein modifications, connect proteomics to structural biology in ways yielding
potential insights into complex disease mechanisms. New techniques based on mass spectrometry (MS),
native MS (i.e., measuring biomolecules in their native solution environment preserving ligand- and other
molecular interactions), and top-down MS/proteomics will be advanced and applied to facilitate the
characterization of proteins and protein assemblies. Coupling sensitive ionization, solution- and gas-phase
separations, new electron-based dissociation methods (e.g., electron capture dissociation, ECD; electron
ionization dissociation, EID) and other activation/dissociation techniques to ultra-high resolution mass
spectrometry will provide an experimental platform for complete sequence and proteoform coverage. These
advanced tools will be employed to characterize important biological complexes for which high-resolution
structures have been difficult to obtain, including G-coupled protein receptors (GPCRs) and other membrane
proteins. The exploration of links between post-translational modifications (PTMs) and proteoforms to the
aggregation and toxicity of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) will be furthered by
our advanced MS methods. Our experimental strategies apply broadly and integrate with numerous
biophysical techniques to enable the detailed structural study of large and complex molecular machines and to
provide insights into their dynamics. Native top-down MS promises to advance structural biology and to hasten
drug discovery and development. Improvements in MS-based technologies can advance our understanding of
how proteins and protein machines drive biology."

COVID remains a major killer and disruptor worldwide. We made fundamental contributions to the understanding
of COVID and T and B cell immune memory after SARS2 infection and COVID vaccines. Those studies
predominantly examined human blood. In Project 1 we now aim to complement those fundamental findings with
studies of T and B cell memory of URT lymphoid tissue and nasal epithelium. Mechanistic studies, particularly
in humans, are essential to inform on URT immune memory and the roles of long GCs in adaptive immune
responses, but are currently sparse or nonexistent given the complexities for such experiments. Here we address
these important knowledge gaps, synergizing with Project 2 and 3. We will do so through a series of experiments.
Additionally, there are striking data demonstrating that (1) long GCs can exist after acute SARS2 infection, (2)
long GCs can exist after a protein immunization, and (3) long GCs can exist after mRNA vaccination. The recent
recognition of these long GCs to acute antigens significantly changes our understanding of immune responses,
and long GCs appear to have great value for protective immunity and immune memory. We hypothesize that
long GCs have broad impacts on adaptive immunity, including memory B cell affinity maturation, memory B cell
functional properties, the functionality and durability of memory follicular helper T (TFH) cells, and characteristics
of mucosal immunity in the upper airways. All of those attributes are directly examined in this Project. In both
components (analyses of long GCs and analyses of URT immune memory), we will study multiple human
cohorts, with particular focus on COVID-19 breakthrough infections and COVID-19 vaccinations."
10808602,"ABSTRACT
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a highly aggressive disease with dismal prognosis associated with high
rates of treatment resistance and disease recurrence. In the last decade, first line NSCLC treatment has been
substantially reinforced with the introduction of immunotherapy targeting immune checkpoints such as
programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or its ligand PD-L1. PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) shows very
promising clinical profile, yet long-term disease control occurs in less than 25% of NSCLC patients.
Understanding the mechanisms of treatment resistance is essential to address the dire need of introducing novel
synergistic therapies to target refractory disease in immune-privileged NSCLC tumors. Experimental evidence
shows that NSCLC tumors, belonging among the most hypoxic tumor types, display poor rates of immune cell
infiltration and impaired T cell effector function within the hypoxic tumor regions. This suggests that low oxygen
may contribute to the immune privilege and poor response to treatment in NSCLC. Interestingly, tumor hypoxia
has been associated with anti-cancer treatment resistance for decades, yet its role in clinical management of
NSCLC remains largely unexplored. Recent literature suggests that persistent antigenic stimulation of tumor-
infiltrating CD8+ T cells within the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) induces T cell exhaustion,
a dysfunctional state characterized by progressive loss of T cell effector function. In the current K22 Transition
Career Development Award application, we propose to investigate the role of tumor hypoxia as a modulator of
immune privilege in murine NSCLC models. We have previously identified that mitochondrial inhibitor papaverine
(PPV) and its experimental derivative SMV-32 can reversibly elevate partial oxygen pressure in murine NSCLC
tumor models by up to 90%. Our preliminary data show that PPV or SMV-32-mediated TME reoxygenation prior
to delivering PD-1 ICB led to significant enhancement of tumor growth delay in mouse syngeneic NSCLC tumor
models, compared to PD-1 monotherapy. Repeated treatment with either drug alone did not affect tumor growth.
We also show that hypoxia leads to enrichment of dysfunctional CD8+ T cell populations in vitro and in vivo and
that reoxygenation promotes elevation of PD-1 ICB-responsive progenitor exhausted T cell population while
decreasing terminally exhausted T cell population. The overall goal of the K22 proposal is to elucidate the TME-
specific mechanisms of hypoxic immune privilege in NSCLC tumors and to gain advanced research experience
and professional development required for transition into a successful independent investigator."

Candidate: My career goal is to become a leading tobacco control investigator combining epidemiological and
mobile health (mHealth) approaches to address substance use among diverse populations. The overarching
goal of this career development award is to become equipped with mHealth intervention in order to develop a
smartphone-based intervention reducing e-cigarette use (nicotine vaping) among young adults (18-25 years old).
Career development plan: To achieve my career and research objectives, I require three mentored training
goals: (T1) machine learning approaches to mHealth data analysis; (T2) clinical treatment for tobacco cessation,
and (T3) mHealth intervention development and implementation. The training and research plan will be guided
by my multidisciplinary mentoring team: Dr. Ling (clinical treatment for young adult vaping cessation), Dr. Marcus
(mHealth methods), Dr. Capra (machine learning methods), Dr. Rigotti (tobacco cessation intervention), Dr. Thrul
(smartphone-based intervention), and Dr. Koester (qualitative methods). Environment: The University of
California San Francisco (UCSF) with a distinguished record of research on tobacco control and mHealth
provides an intellectually outstanding environment for the proposed training and research. In addition to physical
resources, I have access to experts at multiple research centers at UCSF. Research Project: The proposed
research has three specific aims: (1) Assess patterns (e.g., vaping frequency and intensity) and real-time
predictors of young adult vaping (e.g., craving, stress, location); (2) Develop an intervention prototype that
delivers messages tailored to high-risk situations for vaping; and (3) Examine feasibility and acceptability of
delivering the intervention in real-time situations. This study will be the first to assess the potential of a
smartphone-based intervention delivering just-in-time adaptive supports during risky situations for vaping
occurrence. The study is highly significant because: it addresses a major public health concern (i.e., the vaping
epidemic) in a priority population for tobacco control (i.e., young adults); and it provides new scientific evidence
on innovative intervention strategies to curb the vaping epidemic and related negative health effects among
young people. Summary: This proposal uses a rigorous approach combining innovative methods of ecological
momentary assessment, machine learning, Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention, and user-centered design to
develop a personalized vaping cessation intervention that adapts the provision of supports to an individual’s
changing internal and contextual state. The multidisciplinary mentoring team and the outstanding institutional
environment ensure the success of this proposal. This proposal will provide me with critical knowledge and
expertise and preliminary data to launch my independent research career in tobacco control and successfully
submit an R01 application to examine the efficacy of the established vaping cessation intervention."
10809525,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Emerging evidence indicates that co-use of cannabis and e-cigarettes may perpetuate dependence on both
products and lead to adverse health outcomes in young people. Vulnerable groups, such as the Native
Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Filipino (NHPIF) young adults, often use these products at higher rates than
other racial/ethnic groups. However, substance use among NHPIFs has often been overlooked because of the
tendency among researchers to treat Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders (AANHPIs) as a
monolithic group. Although AANHPIs are often regarded as a “low risk” group, when disaggregated, AANHPI
subgroups show marked health disparities, with NHPIFs indicating disproportionately higher rates of tobacco
and other substance use and higher burden of mortality due to cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Thus,
there is an urgent need to examine the unique risk factors that drive higher substance use among NHPIF and
rapidly translate findings into scalable interventions. Despite e-cigarette and cannabis co-use being common, it
has not been studied in NHPIFs. The current phased study will utilize epidemiological data from two sources
(R61 phase) – the cross-sectional Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the longitudinal
Young Adult Health Behavior Survey (YAHB) – to guide the development of a Just-in-Time Adaptive
Intervention (JITAI) for e-cigarette and cannabis co-use (R33) among NHPIF young adults ages 18-30. JITAIs
allow for intervention components to be delivered in real-time through a smartphone application. In the R61
phase, we will identify the relative importance of various social determinants of health in predicting co-use
among NHPIF young adults. Across both surveys, we will examine associations between e-cigarette and/or
cannabis use, rates (prevalence and proportion of use), patterns, and progression (initiation, escalation, and
maintenance), with sociocultural (social vulnerability, family/peer influence and substance use), community,
and advertising/marketing factors, by ethnicity. We hypothesize that low-SES NHPIFs will be identified as the
most vulnerable group for co-use and that social influences will be most highly associated with use, initiation,
escalation, and maintenance. Findings will allow us to calibrate the proposed intervention and tailor the
balance of JITAI components in the R33 phase. Following initial development of the new JITAI, we will conduct
a pilot and qualitative interviews with 10 low-SES NHPIF young adults engaging in co-use to assess feasibility.
After additional intervention refinements, we will conduct an RCT (2-group) of the JITAI with low-SES NHPIF
young adults recruited from community sources who co-use e-cigs and cannabis assigned to intervention
(n=60) or ecological momentary assessment-only (n=60) to examine its impact on frequency and problem e-
cigarette and/or cannabis use."
10825550,"We propose a series of studies that apply a cognitive neuropsychological approach to investigate the
behavioral presentation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in Spanish-English bilinguals. We use models of bilingual
language processing and cognitive decline in AD to motivate experimental manipulations that will reveal the
mechanism/s underlying cognitive deficits in bilinguals with AD. We also address critical practical questions,
aiming to determine if bilinguals should be allowed to use either language during cognitive assessment, if
testing in one language hinders subsequent performance in the other, and more generally how to maximize
test performance and test sensitivity to AD in bilinguals. Theoretical considerations begin with evidence that
although bilinguals do not seem different from monolinguals when they speak in just one language, both
languages always remain active (they cannot just “shut one language off”). Bilinguals also switch languages
both across contexts (e.g., at home vs. at work), and within sentences (when conversing with other bilinguals).
By virtue of using each language only some of the time, bilinguals also use each language less frequently than
monolinguals who only use the one language they know. Thus, bilinguals face unique control requirements in
their everyday language use: choosing which language to speak, switching languages, retrieving less
frequently used linguistic representations, and managing competition between languages. Together, the
proposed studies will examine how these differences affect some of the most commonly used cognitive tests
(e.g., picture naming, list memory, verbal fluency). These studies will also examine experimental tasks
designed to elicit more naturalistic connected speech, including a referential communication task and a read-
aloud task that recently demonstrated sensitivity to AD in bilinguals. Each proposed study focuses on key
factors that we hypothesize can affect test performance – especially in bilinguals with AD, including: (a)
switching languages across testing blocks (order effects), (b) switching within a testing block (the “either
language” option), and (c) switching with varying degrees of support from semantic and syntactic context. We
hypothesize that relative to healthy controls, bilinguals with AD will exhibit larger testing order effects, and
reduced benefit from the option to “use either language” (which invites voluntary language switching).
Bilinguals with AD may also exhibit more prominent switching deficits and reduced ability to exert control over
the dominant language when language switches are not supported by syntactic context. The proposed studies
will develop unique tools for diagnosis of AD in bilinguals and will reveal which cognitive mechanisms are
critical for managing activation, representation, and use of two languages in a single cognitive system. In turn,
the proposed studies will constrain psycholinguistic models of bilingual language processing and will provide
clues as to how bilingualism leads to higher maintenance of cognitive functioning in older age by revealing
which aspects of bilingualism are most challenging in AD."

 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) outcomes in PLWH in South Africa (S.A.) are inferior to those in HIV(-) patients,
although outcomes compare favorably in clinical trials. Advanced stage disease and consistent EBV-association
are well recognized in PLWH. In S.A., at the time of diagnosis, some PLWH are in such poor clinical condition
that they are not treated. Diagnostic delays contribute to late presentations, as HL diagnoses require surgical
biopsies for a definitive pathologic evaluation. Resources and infrastructure in S.A. are limited in this regard.
 To better understand disparate outcomes in PLWH in standard-of-care settings, we propose a prospective
observational study of HIV(+) and HIV(-) HL in S.A. (Aim 1). Performance status (PS), organ function, clinical
stage, tumor histological subtype, EBV association, and mutational landscape will all be assessed, as will
chemotherapy regimen, response to treatment, and cause of death, as determined by a minimally invasive
autopsy in consenting participants. Since tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death in PLWH in S.A., the
symptoms of which mimic HL, HL patients are often empirically treated and repeatedly tested for TB before
excisional biopsies are pursued. A high co-infection rate coupled with immunosuppressive chemotherapy may
lead to TB progression in PLWH during therapy, and may contribute to ultimate mortality. Therefore, Aim 1 will
also have a major focus on the contributions of TB. The results of this study will lead to a better understanding
of the roles that PS, organ function and TB have in HL prognosis in PLWH, as well as aspects of the EBV
association and the mutational features.
 The near uniform association of EBV in HIV(+) HL may aid in the recognition of HL in PLWH via a non-invasive
plasma EBV test that can identify patients needing urgent excisional biopsy. To explore this possibility, we
propose to develop a diagnostic algorithm (Aim 2A) in a discovery cohort of PLWH with HL and without
malignancy. EBV DNA will be assessed along with additional plasma markers to increase specificity. The optimal
combination of markers will be used to develop an algorithm that will be tested in a validation cohort of high risk
PLWH (Aim 2B). Baseline PS and organ function will be obtained, and a rigorous yearlong follow-up will ensure
accurate classification of persons with lymphoma. In those who are diagnosed with HL or other lymphoma, PS
and organ function will be re-assessed. Participants who experience a marked decline in these measures, to the
point that they do not receive standard chemotherapy, will be considered potential “lives saved” if the diagnostic
algorithm could be applied clinically. We note that much of the infrastructure needed to implement the molecular
techniques is available in S.A., and that our South African collaborators have a track record of introducing
sophisticated molecular diagnostics for TB to the entire country.

Adverse drug reactions related to inadequately dosed or prescribed medications are a major cause of morbidity,
mortality, and hospital readmissions in the United States. Pharmacogenetics research has identified genetic variants
associated with response or toxicity for hundreds of drugs, and variant genotypes carried by some individuals may
contribute disproportionately to medication-related hospital admissions. Yet the clinical utility of pharmacogenetics
(PGx) when implemented in healthcare systems has not been widely established. In a resource-limited health system, it
is not practical to genotype every patient, but if we can identify patients at higher risk of hospital admission based on
medication prescribing events, we could be better able to discern which patients to approach with preemptive
genotyping. We propose a cohort study within two learning healthcare systems with established PGx implementation
programs – NorthShore University HealthSystem and The University of Chicago Center – in a pooled, ethnically diverse
patient population of 5,726 patients – to evaluate the aggregate impact of pharmacogenetic drug interactions on
readmissions and Emergency Department (ED) visits attributable to adverse drug reactions including inadequate drug
response, over a two-year follow-up period. The overall goal of this project is to develop novel analytic methods to
quantify the contribution of gene-x-drug interactions after hospital discharge to ED visits and readmissions, and to
identify those individuals at greatest risk of these outcomes. Aim 1 is to estimate the rate of combined 90-day ED visits
and readmissions attributable to inadequate drug response or toxicity and identify the clinical and demographic
predictors of those admissions. Aim 2 is to identify 90-day ED visits and readmissions associated with adverse drug
reactions among patients discharged on medications for which there is evidence of genetic variability for outcomes –
focusing on medications with high-level evidence guidelines from the Clinical Pharmacogenomics Implementation
Consortium and Food and Drug Administration labels prescribed and continued at hospital discharge on 90-day
readmissions. Aim 3 will be to determine the contribution of specific genotypes to medication-related 90-day ED visits
and readmissions visits among genotyped patients. This project is responsive to RFA HG-20-037 Advancing Genomic
Medicine Research by facilitating analysis of clinical genomic data and will leverage the extensive experience of our team
and dataset from two diverse, real-world healthcare systems across Chicagoland. Our multidisciplinary, collaborative
team, aided by use of natural language processing, will screen electronic health records to extract de-identified patient
data, curate, and apply innovative, integrated analytic methods to better identify patients who could benefit the most
from preemptive PGx genotyping and pharmacovigilance to prevent ED visits and readmissions. If, as we hypothesize,
our analyses demonstrate that gene-x-drug interactions contribute substantially to 90-day ED visits and readmissions,
these methods can be automated and will be transportable to other health systems to guide preemptive genotyping
protocols for the highest risk patients to prevent hospital readmissions. These results will inform the design of a future
clinical effectiveness trial of tailored, PGx interventions to prevent adverse drug reactions and associated readmissions."
10934372,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The opioid epidemic has skyrocketed in the United States. Despite the enormous public health impact, the basic
mechanisms underlying the development of opioid use disorder (OUD) remain unclear. Striatal dopamine (DA)
neurotransmission is critical for opioid reward-related behaviors. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) region within
ventral striatum serves as a crucial node for opioid-conditioned reinforcement via dopamine receptor signaling.
Furthermore, the medial shell of the NAc (mNAcSh) has increasingly been implicated in opioid reinforcement
behavior in a mouse self-administration model. Opioids enhance DA release from midbrain DA neurons, whose
projections converge with glutamatergic input in the NAc. 95% of the NAc neuronal population consists of
GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) are largely segregated into two populations based on expression of
DA D1 (D1R) versus D2 (D2R) receptors. Indeed, D1R+ and D2R+ MSNs project to different output structures in
the basal ganglia circuitry which have opposite effects on motor control: D1R+ MSNs exert stimulatory effects on
movement via the direct pathway whereas D2R+ MSNs exert inhibitory control over movement via the indirect
pathway. Moreover, the DA receptors expressed by D1R+ versus D2R+ MSNs are coupled to different G proteins
which signal via different intracellular pathways. In the context of opioids, morphine differentially acts on D1R+
versus D2R+ NAc MSNs. Specifically: 1) morphine administration increases glutamatergic synaptic strength in
NAc D1R+ MSNs, while D2R+ MSNs show opposite effects; and 2) morphine exposure preferentially generates
silent synapses in NAc D2R+ MSNs compared to D1R+ MSNs. Anatomic and functional evidence suggests that
the composition of striatal D1R+ and D2R+ MSN populations is more heterogenous than previously thought. Until
recently, the inability to selectively target D1/2R-co-expressing MSNs has made it very difficult to dissect the
respective contributions of these co-expressing MSNs given their close proximity in the striatum. As a result,
most studies have been in vitro and relied on ectopic receptor overexpression, leading to conflicting findings and
unclear relevance in vivo. Moreover, the specific roles of D1/2R-co-expressing MSNs in opioid abuse have yet
to be examined. To address this, we developed tools to dissect the functional and anatomical properties of
different MSN subpopulations within the same brain. This includes use of the intersectional genetic
INTRSECT2.0 system, which allows us to label and manipulate subsets of MSNs expressing D1R or D2R alone
versus those co-expressing D1R and D2R with great temporal and spatial specificity. With these tools, we will
determine if D1/2R-co-expressing MSNs represent a distinct MSN population, different from neurons that only
express D1R or D2R. We hypothesize that D1/2R-co-expressing NAc MSNs have unique anatomic, physiologic,
and behavioral functions critical for opioid actions. To address this, we will determine the physiological properties
specific to D1/2R-co-expressing NAc MSNs in opioid actions (Aim 1), and identify contributions of D1R and D2R
signaling in specific NAc MSN subpopulations to opioid-induced behaviors (Aim 2)."

Filaments derived from transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) were recently discovered to represent a
novel pathological hallmark in a range of neurodegenerative disorders, including TDP-43 proteinopathies,
synucleinopathies, and tauopathies. Notably, TMEM106B genetic variants are linked to risk of frontotemporal
lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP), particularly cases with progranulin (GRN) and
chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72) mutations, and limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43
encephalopathy (LATE) neuropathologic change. TMEM106B variants also associate with cognitive decline in
patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. While several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
TMEM106B have been identified and linked to disease risk, only one (rs3173615) introduces a coding change
(p.T185S) and it is in high linkage disequilibrium with other risk SNPs. To investigate the intriguing idea that
rs3173615 could modulate disease risk through regulation of TMEM106B deposition, we developed an
antibody against the TMEM106B filament core sequence. Consistent with recent reports, we detected
TMEM106B-positive filaments in the sarkosyl-insoluble fraction from FTLD-TDP and LATE patients.
Remarkably, we also observed increased accumulation of insoluble TMEM106B in FTLD-TDP patients
homozygous for the rs3173615 risk allele (encoding threonine at residue 185 instead of serine). Collectively,
these findings support the hypothesis that TMEM106B aggregation explains the link between genetic variation
at the TMEM106B locus and disease risk – and we suspect that it could also explain potential links between
rs3173615, TDP-43 proteinopathy, and cognitive decline. We also speculate that differences in TMEM106B
accumulation contribute to clinical and pathologic heterogeneity in both FTLD and LATE. Moreover, given that
LATE is associated with greater hypometabolism on [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose PET (FDG-PET) in the frontal
lobe, a region populated by TMEM106B fibrils, we predict that rs3173615 genotype will also associate with
neuroimaging measures of neurodegeneration. In this project, we will investigate the impact of rs3173615
genotype on TMEM106B aggregation and assess whether it associates with TDP-43 proteinopathy and clinical
outcomes. We will also explore the mechanism by which the rs3173615 coding variant affects TMEM106B fibril
formation, as well as the potential functional consequences of TMEM106B genetic variation and fibril
accumulation. Our approach to the latter will be two-fold: as a candidate-based approach, we will determine
whether TMEM106B genetic variants impact lysosomal function in neurons, and as an unbiased approach, we
will use proteomic analyses to build protein-protein interaction and co-aggregation networks from the soluble
and insoluble fractions of patient brains, focusing on differences observed in carriers of the T185 allele versus
carriers of the S185 protective genotype."

Cardiac arrest and stroke are serious health concerns and pressing public health issues in the United States,
affecting over a million people every year. However, the severity of the problem is largely underestimated,
because a significant portion of patients with asymptomatic cerebral ischemia following cardiac arrest or stroke
are unnoticed and undiagnosed, which is often referred to as “silent brain ischemia (SBI)”. As one type of SBI,
silent strokes are more common than strokes that cause detected symptoms. The SBI is usually categorized on
the basis of a standard neurological exam, which does not cause any disability or symptoms of cognitive decline.
Population-bases studies have observed a long-term association between SBI and an increased risk of
developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, research study on the strategies to determine
the underlying mechanisms and prevent SBI-induced dementia is urgently needed in a society with a growing
aged population. Herein, we propose that pulsed laser therapy could effectively protect the SBI brain from
developing AD dementia. We have recently demonstrated the beneficial effects of laser therapy in brain injury
and neurodegeneration, including global cerebral ischemia (GCI), stroke and AD. In this proposal, we will apply
technically innovative approaches to improve the laser’s efficacy that penetrates the brain at sufficient depth,
providing further beneficial evidence of laser therapy. In healthy wild type rats that subjected to a short-term
3-min GCI, we were unable to identify any pathological and behavioral changes in long term. However, such a
brief ischemic insult could significantly accelerate plaque formation and cognitive decline in the transgenic AD
rats. For the first time, the SBI model is combined with the clinically relevant AD rat model to simulate clinical
SBI conditions in increasing the incidence of AD dementia. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that
SBI-induced DNA damage response (DDR) and cellular senescence in the vascular endothelial cells plays a
causal role in the pathogenesis of SBI-AD dementia. We hypothesize that ions containing blood hemoglobin
exudes through the damaged blood-brain barrier gradually aggregates Aβ deposition, which ultimately
culminate in neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in the SBI-AD rats. We will further test the hypothesis
that pulsed laser therapy will increase internal levels of hydrogen sulfide, a key gaseous signaling molecule
mediating DNA repair and senescent inhibition, which was compromised in the SBI-AD animals. The proposed
research is both mechanistically and technically innovative as it will elucidate the causal pathological
progression underlying SBI-accelerated AD dementia in a novel AD-like rat model while also identifying novel
mechanism for pulsed laser therapy. Therefore, this proposal has valuable clinical novelty for the prevention of
SBI-accelerated AD dementia."

Osteochondral defects (OCDs) – localized damage to the cartilage and subchondral bone of a joint – often
lead to pain, loss of joint function, and osteoarthritis. This work seeks to develop a superior treatment (versus
autografting, allografting, and partial resurfacing implants) to treat OCDs of knees and other joints. Proposed
is a bioprosthetic implant – a “cartilage-capped, regenerative osteochondral plug (CC-ROP)” - that
combines a permanent synthetic resurfacing cartilage cap and a biodegradable bone regenerative
base. The cartilage cap will be prepared from a biostable, ultra-tough hydrogel, circumventing the low
regeneration potential of cartilage tissue and providing immediate matching of the strength, stiffness,
hydration, lubricity, and wear-resistance of native cartilage. The underlying biodegradable scaffold base will
promote new bone formation to anchor the cartilage cap. The CC-ROP’s autograft-sized, cylindrical geometry
will allow for implantation with existing surgical techniques. To promote healing and functionality, both the
cartilage cap and osseous scaffold base will be designed to also support integration with adjacent tissue.
Cartilage cap: Synthetic, biostable cartilage replacements (e.g., UHMWPE) lack the combined biomechanical
properties of native cartilage, and do not provide critical integration to adjacent tissue. Thus, CC-ROP’s
cartilage cap will be prepared with a new electrostatic, double network (DN) hydrogel that has been shown
by the team to mimic the stiffness, strength, and lubrication of native articular cartilage. Poration at the
perimeter of the cap and a bioactive polydopamine coating will encourage in-growth of adjacent tissue.
Osseous scaffold base: The base will be formed with a biodegradable, templated semi-interpenetrating
polymer network (semi-IPN) PCL:PLLA scaffold that the team has shown supports hBMSC osteogenesis in
vitro, as well as neotissue formation and integration in vivo. CC-ROP: To evaluate their potential to heal
OCDs, CC-ROPs will be evaluated in terms of metrics of cartilage resurfacing and integration, as well as
osseous tissue regeneration and integration. Prof. Melissa Grunlan (PI) will lead all efforts in Aims 1-2
related to the fabrication of the CC-ROPs. Prof. Mariah Hahn (Co-I) will lead in vitro cell culture studies
(Aim 1) to evaluate hBMSC behavior on the osseous scaffolds as well as the potential for chondrocytic
invasion into the cartilage cap and immunoreactivity of potential cap wear debris. In Aim 2, the in vivo
performance of the CC-ROPs in a rabbit femoral condyle OCD model will be assessed. Prof. Brian Saunders
(Co-I) will lead subcutaneous biocompatibility studies (in rats) and OCD studies (in rabbits) in terms of
histology and micro-CT. Prof. Michael Moreno will lead efforts to test the biomechanical properties of the
explanted rabbit knees and controls. A veterinary pathologist, Prof. Roy Pool (consultant), will read and score
histology slides (Aim 2). Dr. Patrick McCulloch (consultant), an orthopedic surgeon, will provide guidance."
10807831,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Ambient air pollution exposure is a significant risk factor for the development and progression of
pulmonary disease. Short- and long-term exposure to air pollution constituents such as fine particulate matter
(PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), black carbon (BC), and ozone (O3) has been associated with respiratory health
effects including negative impacts on lung function, increased incidence of respiratory infections, and
increased morbidity and mortality in patients with COPD. Individuals who live in communities with higher
proportions of historically marginalized populations and/or individuals with lower socioeconomic status (i.e.
“overburdened” or “Environmental Justice” [EJ] communities) have higher levels of air pollution exposure and
may be at increased risk of negative respiratory outcomes related to air pollution exposure. However,
disparities in exposures and their respiratory health effects in these vulnerable populations have been poorly
characterized. Additionally, there is a lack of adequate clinical tools to identify patients with higher burdens of
air pollution exposure and thus may be at increased risk of negative health effects.
 The objective of this project is to characterize the relationship between combustion-related air pollution
exposure and respiratory health among vulnerable populations, including those who live in environmentally
overburdened communities, and to investigate clinically useful biomarkers of air pollution exposure in high-risk
individuals. The first aim of this proposal is to examine the effects of short-term exposure to air pollution,
including PM2.5, NO2, BC, and O3, on lung function in a large, nationwide cohort of adults, and to evaluate the
effects of neighborhood context and community-level factors (i.e. residence in an overburdened community) on
the relationship between air pollution exposure and pulmonary outcomes. The second and third aims of this
proposal focus on the assessment of novel biomarkers of air pollution exposure in a cohort of COPD patients
utilizing an innovative methodology, nasosorption, to collect nasal fluid samples from the upper respiratory
tract. Levels of inflammatory mediators and metals in these nasal fluid samples will be analyzed in order to
assess levels of these biomarkers in association with personal air pollution exposure, with the ultimate goal of
developing clinically useful tools for air pollution exposure assessment in high-risk patients.
 This project will be conducted with the guidance of an expert team of environmental pulmonary
epidemiologists and physician-investigators. The principal investigator will partake in formal coursework in
epidemiology and biostatistics and will receive hands-on mentorship and training from leaders in the field of
environmental health and pulmonary medicine. The research will take place primarily at the Institute for Lung
Health at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, with additional support and collaboration from the Harvard
School of Public and the Harvard Combined Pulmonary and Critical Care Fellowship Program."
10807833,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Some underrepresented groups are particularly susceptible to Heart, Lung, Blood, and Sleep
(HLBS) disorders. These disparities persist over time, even in the face of notable improvements in morbidity
and mortality rates overall. Since the diversity of the US population is increasing annually, there is a sense of
urgency to address these disparities now. The NIH is committed to recruiting and retaining a more diverse
workforce with the potential to contribute new ideas and innovative solutions to help reduce these disparities.
Objectives: In response to RFA-HL-24-003, this is a competing renewal to serve as the Coordination Center
(CC) for the Programs for Inclusion and Diversity Among Individuals Engaged in Health-Related Research
(PRIDE) (U24). The current PRIDE consists of 10 active Summer Institute (SI) research education training
programs with the general goal of providing research experiences, skills development and mentoring for early
career biomedical researchers from underrepresented groups. The CC will facilitate the coordination of
education and evaluation activities among the SI programs by facilitating: 1) the coordination of program-wide
activities (e.g., organization, outreach and recruitment, and candidate screening); 2) the education and support
through implementing the small research projects (SRP) and distributions of resources, tools and opportunities;
and 3) the development and implementation of an evaluation plan that integrates data from previous cohorts.
The evaluation protocol will assess key outcomes, collect and track outcomes across time, and benchmark
these outcomes against a comparison group of untrained faculty matched to the PRIDE participants.
Significance and Innovation: Since this is a competing renewal, the infrastructure and organization already is
operational, although we are prepared to make timely and efficient changes as needed. There is continuity,
with the contact PI having served in this capacity since the beginning of the project (over 17 years). Finally,
knowing whether the training has been successful depends on having relevant comparisons. Our application
specifically addresses this issue by adding an MPI who is trained in bioinformatics methods and has access to
unique electronic training education records for discovery and recruiting an appropriate comparison sample.
Methodology: This project is built around our web-based infrastructure that allows Public and Secure access
to program information, including our on-line data entry system, which will be upgraded and further automated
during the funding cycle. Summary: Our team has unique expertise and experience to continue as the CC for
the PRIDE and evaluate those indicators of success outlined in the RFA and this proposal. Further, we are
uniquely positioned to assess the impact of this program by benchmarking our results against a matched
comparison group, and look forward to tracking the career development of these bright and motivated
investigators as they lead us into the future."
10807834,"Numerous mutational variants in the SORLA (SORL1) gene are associated with increased Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) risk, and although growing evidence from our group and others support a neuroprotective role for
SORLA in suppressing effects associated with Aβ, virtually nothing is known with respect to whether SORLA
can modulate proteotoxic effects associated with tau. Here, we present evidence that transgenic upregulation of
SORLA (“SORLA TG”) can reduce tau phosphorylation, as well as pathological ventricular dilation in 9 month-
old (9MO) PS19 (P301S tau) mouse brain. Proteomic analysis reveals changes in proteomic profiles related to
synaptic dysfunction and microglial activation, including upregulation of APOE and the complement component,
C1q in PS19 mouse hippocampus; these changes were largely suppressed in SORLA TG/PS19 hippocampus,
indicating that SORLA upregulation can potentially reverse pathological changes associated with tau
proteotoxicity. Histological analysis indicates that C1q and astrogliosis is highly upregulated in PS19
hippocampus, and these effects were reduced in SORLA TG/PS19 animals. Interestingly, C1q has been
previously shown to label synapses for microglial uptake and elimination in both J20 (hAPP) and PS19 mouse
brain, which together, suggests that SORLA potentially mediates neuroprotective effects through suppression of
deleterious changes associated with synaptic factors and gliosis in PS19 hippocampus. Our prior work also
demonstrates that upregulation of a cleaved soluble SORLA (sSORLA) form in SORLA TG animals is also
protective in neurons, and enhances neurite regeneration with neuronal injury. We therefore hypothesize that
SORLA can mediate neuroprotective effects to limit tau pathology/proteotoxicity and determine here, whether
and how SORLA overexpression, deletion or sSORLA can affect tau pathology and pathogenesis.
 As our results demonstrate that SORLA TG/PS19 animals can reverse pathological and proteomic
features associated with late-stage (9MO) tau pathology, we will also characterize changes at early and mid-
stages of tau pathology, and characterize cell-type specific transcriptomic changes in 9MO hippocampus in PS19
mice that may be potentially suppressed in SORLA TG/PS19 animals by snRNAseq analysis. We will also
characterize effects of SORLA upregulation on glial-associated synaptic uptake and pruning in PS19 and SORLA
TG/PS19 animals, and compare effects of intraneuronal tau dispersion from the MEC to DG region in wildtype
(WT) vs SORLA TG brain using an AAV-tau propagation model used in our lab (Aim 1) (Zhu et al., 2022). We
will also determine effects of SORLA deletion on tau pathology, gliosis and synpatotoxicity (Aim 2), and
characterize effects of AD-associated SORLA mutational variants (T2134M, E2055X) that potentially upregulate
sSORLA on microglial function and SORLA/sSORLA expression in an ESC-based human microglia cells in vitro,
and in human microglial xenotransplant models in PS19/hMCSF mouse brain in vivo (Aim 3). Together, results
from this study will provide insight into a previously undescribed role for SORLA and sSORLA in tau pathology."
10807837,"Project Summary/Abstract
The human SLC17A5 gene encodes a constituent of the lysosomal cell membrane of neurons, a proton-
coupled transporter protein termed Sialin. This solute carrier protein has several defined activities, including
the transport of the negatively charged sugars, glucuronic and free sialic acid, out of lysosomes for use in
glycoprotein and glycolipid formation. Diseases associated with mutations in SLC17A5 are autosomal
recessive neurodegenerative disorders that, depending on the mutation, manifest either as a severe infantile
sialic acid storage disorder that leads to lethality in early childhood, or as Salla disease, a milder, slowly
progressive adult form characterized by intellectual disability, ataxia, hypomyelination, hypotonia, epilepsy, and
neurodegeneration. These are very rare and understudied conditions; it is estimated that there are less than
1,000 individuals with Salla disease in the United States. This R03 proposal is associated with RFA-TR-22-
030 for Pilot Projects to Investigate Understudied Proteins Associated with Rare Diseases. Here, we will
model two prominent symptoms associated with Salla disease: epilepsy and neurodegeneration, using the
nematode model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans, to circumvent the premature lethality resulting from
SLC17A5 deletion in mice. The C. elegans slc-17.2 gene product shares over 55% similarity with human
SLC17A5/Sialin and is widely expressed within neurons. In Aim 1, we will examine viable slc-17.2 CRISPR-
generated null mutants for epileptic-like convulsions. C. elegans is well-studied for factors that influence
neuronal excitability. Using two complimentary experimental paradigms, both involving a chemical-genetic
approach to incite hyperexcitability in either cholinergic or GABAergic neurons, slc-17.2 mutants will be
evaluated for evidence of convulsive behaviors with and without slc-17.2 expression. To reveal functional
modifiers of a convulsive phenotype, we will perform a systematic genetic analysis of 10 conserved candidate
targets corresponding to gene products listed as protein-protein interactors with human Sialin in the NIH
Pharos database. Existing mutants for each of these candidates will be crossed to slc-17.2 knockout animals
to screen for modifiers of convulsion phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will employ a complementary strategy to model
the progressive nature of Salla disease by examining C. elegans slc-17.2 mutants for an impact on dopamine
neuron degeneration as animals age. As in Aim 1, a systematic genetic analysis of the same 10 candidate
interactors of SLC17A5/Sialin will be conducted to uncover modifiers of any SLC17A5 effects on C. elegans
dopamine neurons. Candidate effectors will be parsed rigorous quantification of neurodegeneration, at the
single neuron level, in isogenic populations, using different mutant backgrounds. This 1-year study will
establish a platform for preclinical screening of factors that can correct or compensate for the lysosomal
deficits caused by SLC17A5 mutation. Our approach exemplifies how intact invertebrate models can facilitate
the ascription of functions to understudied proteins and accelerate mechanistic understanding of rare diseases."
10812224,"Project Summary
The sense of smell provides animals with vital information about their environment. At the molecular level,
olfactory stimuli consist of thousands of distinct small molecules that share no common chemical feature other
than being volatile. To contend with this diversity, insects and mammals alike have evolved large families of
olfactory receptors (ORs) that operate in a combinatorial way, whereby some receptors are broadly activated by
many different odorants and others are exquisitely tuned to a specific compound. The molecular mechanisms
that endow ORs with such diverse ligand-binding properties remain unknown, largely because the isolation and
structural characterization of ORs has been a decades-long technological challenge. Using cryo-electron
microscopy, I recently determined the first atomic-resolution structure of an insect OR bound to an odor. By
determining the structures of additional insect ORs with broad and specific ligand-binding properties, the
proposed research project will elucidate the molecular mechanism of odor detection and discrimination.
To this end, the K99 mentored phase (Aim 1) will reveal the atomic structures of two primitive insect ORs with
different ligand specificities unbound and in complex with multiple odor ligands, shedding light on the molecular
determinants that underlie broad or specific odor selectivity. Next, the R00 independent phase (Aim 2) will focus
on ORs from disease-carrying mosquitoes that participate in human host-seeking. These ORs exhibit small
polymorphisms that drastically affect their ability to detect human odors. Elucidation of the atomic structure of
these mosquito ORs bound to human volatiles will illuminate the molecular properties that enable mosquitoes to
detect and prey on humans. Together, this research program will lend fundamental insight into the normal
function of sensory processing of olfactory information. Additionally, as insect ORs are critically involved in
human host-seeking that facilitates the spread of insect-borne diseases, this work will provide a foundation for
the development of novel insect repellents that could curb diseases such as malaria, Zika, and dengue fever.
The proposed development plan complements my training in structural biology and biophysics with
computational modeling of receptor-ligand interactions and in vivo assays in Drosophila. At the end of the
mentored phase, I will be equipped with the necessary tools to conduct comprehensive structural and functional
studies of odor detection and discrimination by insect vectors of disease. To achieve these goals, I will take
advantage of the extensive resources of the Rockefeller University, the mentorship of Dr. Vanessa Ruta and the
appointment of an Advisory Committee that will lend expertise in key aspects of the project and career
development. Additionally, with the support and resources from the MOSAIC/UE5 network I will expand my
mentorship and leadership skills to successfully transition to an independent position while continuing my
ongoing efforts to enhance diversity in the biomedical workforce."

The long-term objective of this project is to improve the reach and uptake of evidence-based lifestyle programs
to reduce disparities in diabetes (T2D) related outcomes among immigrant men. The study will explore the
role of social networks, defined as family and peers, to support healthy lifestyle behaviors among immigrant
men through the shared medical appointment model and to understand the diffusion of health behaviors
amongst participants’ social networks. The aims are to: (1a & 1b) Qualitatively explore perceptions and
cultural preferences for a clinic-based shared medical appointment intensive lifestyle intervention to inform
program adaptation; (2) Conduct a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of social network-
based (participant + social partner) versus individual-based (participant only) SMA ILI among South Asian and
West African immigrant participants with prediabetes/T2D; and (3) Assess the behavioral outcomes of the pilot
intervention amongst members of participants’ social networks to determine if there are spillover effects. The
project will prepare Dr. Shah to transition to an independent clinician scientist using innovative health system-
based models to leverage family and social networks to improve health outcomes and reduce disparities
among vulnerable populations. Her career development plan includes these training goals to: (1) Gain skills in
cultural adaptation of an intervention to reduce prediabetes/T2D; (2) Develop expertise in pragmatic evaluation
design, protocols, and analysis; (3) Obtain advanced skills in social network analysis; and (4) Advance skills in
presentation, manuscript and grant-writing. The research will be conducted in the primary care setting of the
Emory Family Medicine Center in Dunwoody, GA, which serves a diverse patient population and is the site of
Dr. Shah’s clinical practice. This K23 Career Development Award will also leverage the training resources of
the Georgia Clinical and Translational Science Alliance. Results from this project will provide pilot data for an
R01/R18 application to further evaluate the reach and uptake of culturally adapted lifestyle interventions for
immigrant men with prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, an underrepresented group in current translational
studies to date."
10810314,"Project Summary
 The number of physician-scientists in the United States has decreased from its peak of 5% in 1980 to
1.5% today. This decline particularly threatens Pediatrics and child health research where only 12.6% of all
MD/PhD program graduates choose residency training in Pediatrics and in Internal Medicine, while 40% of U.S.
MD/PhD graduates enter Internal Medicine residency programs, these trainees only account for 3.6% of all
Internal Medicine trainees. Of those, smaller numbers train in infectious diseases, clinical immunology and
rheumatology. Together, these data represent a critical need, and opportunity, for new and sustained efforts to
reinvigorate the physician-scientist pipeline infectious diseases, allergy and immunologic diseases. The Icahn
School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is well poised to answer this call for novel on-ramps into the Physician-
Scientist Pathway during residency given its established infrastructure for Research Tracks in Residency which
successfully track accomplished researchers to academic research-focused fellowships and are synergistic with
this proposal. The opportunity to cultivate opportunities for research during residency is ideally suited to our
robust translational research programs. Our excellence in biomedical research across the basic, clinical, and
translational spectrum, along with the ability to individualize and adapt to each physician-scientist trainee, makes
our environment an ideal place to train future physician-scientists. The Mount Sinai Stimulating Access to
Research in Residency (StARR) is a new program to enhance physician-scientist research training opportunities
related to the mission of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID). Mount Sinai StARR will
provide Internal Medicine and Pediatrics residents an entrez into the physician-scientist pipeline, especially
focused on those with a passion for inquiry, but who may not have had extensive research experience--the “late
bloomers”. The program will provide a stepwise introduction to investigative research to recruit resident trainees
and will be an attractive recruiting tool across and outside the Mount Sinai Health System that will build an
immersive individualized research experience with the goal of accelerating and retaining research independence
for resident investigators."
