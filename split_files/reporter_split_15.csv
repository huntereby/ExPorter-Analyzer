Sustained, widespread availability of evidence-based practices (EBPs) is essential to addressing the public
health and societal impacts of adolescent substance use disorders (SUD), as recognized by the NIDA priority
(Strategic Objective 3.4) to investigate strategies for effective and sustainable implementation of EBPs. There
remains a particularly significant need to identify effective financing strategies, which secure and direct
financial resources to support essential activities for EBP implementation and sustainment, and overcome
cost-related barriers to the availability of effective adolescent SUD treatments. The proposed R01 project will
compare the effects of two SAMHSA grant mechanisms (i.e., financing strategies), which supported the
adoption of an EBP for adolescent SUD, the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach, through either
organization-focused or state-focused granting of funds. The Exploration-Preparation-Implementation-
Sustainment framework will guide our study aims, hypotheses, and selection of measures. The interdisciplinary
project team – consisting of experts in implementation science, adolescent SUD treatment, health economics,
public policy, and statistics – will employ a longitudinal, mixed method (i.e., quantitative surveys and qualitative
interviews, document review, and focus groups), quasi-experimental design to compare the grant types’
outcomes and examine theoretically-informed mediators and moderators. Aim 1 will examine penetration of the
Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach among eligible clinicians (i.e., proportion certified with
adequate fidelity) and clients (i.e., proportion receiving the treatment) at the end of SAMHSA funding; and Aim
2 will examine sustainment of the treatment model, using a 10-element composite measure of treatment
delivery and supervision activities, up to 5 years post-funding. Our approach aligns with a previous grant
(R01AA021217), enabling integration of the data we collect from state-focused grant recipients (85
organizations in 19 states) with previously collected data on implementation and sustainment outcomes among
organization-focused grant recipients (84 organizations in 26 states). We will also evaluate non-equivalent
dependent variables (i.e., outcomes that are not expected to change as a result of grant type) to control for key
observable, time-varying cohort effects within our quasi-experimental study design. Finally, Aim 3 will use
comparative case study methods to identify policy implications for promoting EBP penetration and
sustainability through integration of our diverse quantitative and qualitative measures. The proposed research
will have immediate, practical implications for behavioral health administrators, policymakers, implementation
experts, and the public with new knowledge that can directly inform financing strategies to support large-scale,
sustained EBP delivery in behavioral health – while simultaneously advancing the emergent implementation
science field through use of novel methods to study financing strategies and sustainment outcomes."

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe chronic lung disease that develops over the first months of
life in more than half of infants born less than 30wk of gestation. Infants who develop grade 3 BPD, the most
severe disease form (defined as invasive ventilation at 36wk postmenstrual age), are at high risk for life-long
deficits in health and cognition and poor quality of life. Unfortunately, rates of grade 3 BPD are increasing, and
no therapies have been proven to treat this devastating disease. A key contributor to these care gaps is the
nearly singular reliance on the prescribed respiratory support to define BPD presence and severity, select
therapeutic interventions, and assess prognosis. Our data and others’ show that this subjective diagnostic
approach masks significant heterogeneity in clinical presentation, treatment responsiveness, and outcomes. In
other heterogenous chronic respiratory conditions such as COPD, cystic fibrosis, and asthma, evidence-
based phenotyping (identification of patient subgroups based on shared characteristics) has become the new
gold-standard to objectively classify distinct disease sub-types, improve patient counseling, identify novel
disease mechanisms, and discover and implement more effective treatments. Our central hypothesis is that
multidimensional phenotyping in grade 3 BPD is feasible, will accurately characterize disease heterogeneity,
and will improve outcome prediction. Confirmation of this hypothesis will promote a frameshift towards an
objective, systematic diagnostic approach in BPD and first-ever phenotype-specific trials in neonatology.
 Importantly, our motivating preliminary data support this hypothesis. Using retrospective results from
chest CT, cardiac echo, and bronchoscopy, we showed that preterm infants with grade 3 BPD can be
classified into phenotypes based on the presence or absence of severe parenchymal lung disease, abnormal
large airways, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. This diagnostic approach correlated with pre-discharge
outcomes and suggested possible phenotype-specific therapies. However, it relied on investigator chosen
phenotypes rather than empirically derived subgroups, used qualitative results from only 3 diagnostic tests,
and did not assess longitudinal phenotype stability or post-discharge outcomes. Our recent data indicate that
serial quantitative cardiopulmonary imaging and evaluation of proven mechanistic contributors to BPD may
improve disease phenotyping and outcome prediction. Our proposal builds on these preliminary data and will
employ robust cluster analyses and longitudinal multidimensional imaging, biological, and clinical data in a
large, prospective cohort of very preterm infants to accomplish the following Specific Aims: (1) define
objective, evidence-based phenotypes in grade 3 BPD, and (2) define the strength of association between
grade 3 BPD phenotypes and neurodevelopmental and pulmonary outcomes through 2 years’ corrected age
using standardized development testing and validated outcome measures."

The parenchymal cell of adipose tissue is the white adipocyte, which is now understood to be a dynamic
and active participant in metabolic homeostasis. Adipocytes store and release energy as needed, they
coordinate physiological functions throughout the body via the elaboration of “adipokines”, and they
have associations with human disease traits. Understanding the diversity of human adipocytes has
been challenging, because of the technical difficulties inherent in working with large, fragile cells. We
have now used advanced single nuclear sequencing techniques to circumvent this issue, and have now
identified seven distinct subpopulations of human white adipocytes. There are many questions
remaining, including whether there are more subpopulations in different adipose depots, what their
functions are, and how they develop. In this proposal we will address these issues using a combination
of phenotyping modalities, combined with experimental manipulations of signaling molecules and
transcription factors that are predicted to affect adipocyte subpopulation development and function.
Furthermore, we will associate these subpopulations with human metabolic disease traits. Finally, a key
deliverable of this proposal is a Human Adipose Tissue Knowledge Portal, which will assimilate the data
generated here and integrate it with data from other groups, facilitating standardization of experimental
protocols, data analysis, and nomenclature. The resulting database will be a community resource and
the starting point for a new era of adipose tissue biology."

As a critical barrier tissue, the intestinal mucosa must balance complex environmental stimuli — including dietary
components, microbes, metabolites, and xenobiotics — to fine-tune immune development and tolerance. In
health, homeostasis is maintained via a constellation of specialized cell types that connect host physiology to
these external signals. Disruption of intestinal physiology results in numerous diseases, including inflammatory
conditions such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Here, we propose a framework to dissect the cellular
mechanisms underlying the homeostatic and inflamed states in the small intestine and colon at unprecedented
spatial and temporal resolution. In Aim 1, we will spatially profile gene and protein expression across human gut
samples in health and disease, developing the necessary computational tools to identify critical disruptions in
cell-cell communication networks that result from inflammation. Computational tools developed in this context
will have broad application in studying tissue biology. Additionally, we will make cross-disease comparisons (e.g.,
Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, and eosinophilic gastroenteritis) to identify common inflammatory mechanisms
independent of tissue type. In Aim 2, we will leverage experimental mouse models to spatially profile the
dynamics of inflammation (from homeostasis through induction and resolution of inflammation) and dietary stress
in the mouse gut — generating temporally resolved maps of these processes. In Aim 3, we will use organoid and
cell-cell coculture models to determine how chemosensory pathways are translated into the coordinated cellular
responses that maintain homeostasis."

The University of Chicago Growth, Development and Disabilities MD/PhD Training Program is designed to
provide basic science and translational research training for a highly selective group of medical students in a
combined-degree program. The Program is based on the premise that a commitment to complete both the MD
and PhD degrees and to establish and maintain a research-focused career is only developed after some time
in medical school (hence no attrition from this training program since 1978). Students are chosen on the basis
of outstanding academic credentials, demonstrated ability in basic science, and devotion to pursuit of a
research-oriented career. All students fulfill the requirements of a PhD in a particular discipline and complete
the same requirements for the MD as other medical students. They are continuously and longitudinally advised
by the Program Director, co-Directors and staff, a Student Advisory Committee, an External Advisory
Committee, and Mentors who have outstanding records of promoting the training, education and career
advancement of biomedical scientists. The Program attempts to closely align its training goals with the mission
of NICHD to foster training in the areas of growth, development, and disabilities research and clinical
specialties in pediatrics and related areas. The overall Program, its elements, and the participants are
assessed via multiple evaluation tools through the year. The ultimate success is measured by the impact of the
trainees’ thesis research, the completion of both the MD and PhD degrees, and their long-term success as
physician-scientists."

PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
DNA transposons and alternative pre-mRNA splicing. D. Rio – PI
 Mobile genetic elements or transposons are found in the genomes of all organisms. These
elements can move via DNA or RNA intermediates. About 50% of the human genome is made up of
transposable elements with ~ 2.7% corresponding to DNA-based transposons. Many of these
putative transposons or transposase-related genes are uncharacterized. Our previous studies have
focused on the P element family of DNA transposons in Drosophila. P element transposase functions
as a tetramer, using GTP as a cofactor for transposition. N-terminal domain of the transposase
corresponds to a C2CH THAP DNA binding domain, which is a member of a prevalent family of DNA
binding domains found exclusively in animal genomes. One THAP gene, called THAP9, is
homologous to the Drosophila P element transposase and is present in primates, Xenopus, zebrafish
and Ciona, but is absent from rodents. Recent work from our lab has shown that the human and
zebrafish THAP9 genes can mobilize the Drosophila and zebrafish P element transposons in human
and Drosophila cells. We have also used cryo-EM to solve the structure of the P element
transposase strand transfer complex. This proposal is focused on understanding what role the human
THAP9 gene may play in human embryonic stem cells and the reaction pathway that the Drosophila
P element transposase protein uses to recognize and assemble with the transposon ends, donor
DNA, target DNA and GTP/Mg2+ to form an active protein-DNA complex. These studies are aimed at
gaining mechanistic insights.
Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is an important mechanism for regulating gene expression in
metazoans and is a conduit through which genomic sequence is transferred to proteomic information.
Most eukaryotic genes are split and have the potential for alternative splicing, dramatically increasing
proteomic diversity. Many human and mouse disease gene mutations affect the splicing process. in
fact, somatic mutations in splicing factor and spliceosomal genes have been linked to human
diseases, such as cancer and the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
Our previous work has focused on characterization of the tissue-specific Drosophila P element pre-
mRNA exonic splicing silencer element. Recent work from our group has focused on how the action
of the RNA binding proteins, PSI and hrp48 and the human RNA binding splicing factors hnRNPA1
and DDX5. We are using this information to identify new Drosophila cellular splicing silencer elements
that are controlled by PSI and hrp48. We are also analyzing mutant forms of hnRNPA1 that are
linked to ALS to find splicing pattern defects that could be used as biomarkers for the disease or
provide clues to have neurons are dying in the disease. Splicing silencers are a major type of RNA
control element generating tissue- or cell type-specific alternative splicing patterns. The PSI protein
also interacts with U1 snRNP and PSI mutant Drosophila strains that abolish this interaction exhibit
male courtship behavior defects and altered pre-mRNA splicing of the Drosophila male-specific
fruitless pre-mRNA isoforms. We want to investigate how the PSI protein controls fruitless pre-mRNA
splicing and how it controls binding of U1 snRNP on the Drosophila transcriptome. U1 snRNP has
distinct roles in U1 snRNP binding sites in PCPA (premature cleavage and polyadenylation), splicing
at intron 5' splice sites, at cryptic 5' splice sites and at splicing silencers (from our work)."

 This is a resubmission of a competing renewal application of the Visual Sciences Training (VST)
Grant from Baylor College of Medicine (BCM, T32 EY007001) which was first awarded by the National Institutes
of Health in 1975. Since that time, this program has trained 72 predoctoral students and 88 postdoctoral fellows,
and many of them have become leaders in vision and ophthalmic research. Trainees trained during the last
5 years have published 45 papers. The VST program has 21 preceptors from 8 departments and 8 graduate
PhD programs in BCM, carrying 15 active qualifying (+ 2X NCE) R01 grants supported from the National Eye
Institute and 36 grants from other federal research agencies or foundations.
The Program is directed by Samuel M. Wu, PhD, who has been a preceptor on this training grant for 38 years,
and has been the Principal Investigator and Program Director since 1994. Dr. Wu is assisted by a training
Grant coordinator, Jessica Nollkamper, and three committees, the Steering Committee, Recruitment/Admissions
Committee and Academic Progress Committee. The objective of this training program is to train competent
basic and translational vision researchers, and to equip them with cutting edge scientific ideas and techniques
to face scientific and medical challenges of the 21st century. Trainees are required to take a number of didactic
vision, neuroscience, genetics and ethics courses, and expected to acquire comprehensive knowledge of the
entire visual system and the associated diseases, and to learn state-of-the-art experimental techniques.
Additionally, a trainee will be guided by his/her preceptors (and other members of the program) into at least
one specialized area of the visual system, one research discipline and one disease in great depth, so that he/she

We propose the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) Cancer Genetics, Epigenetics, Models, and Signaling
(Cancer GEMS) Training Program. HCI is a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer
Center and the official Cancer Center of the State of Utah. Contributing to HCI’s mission of reducing morbidity
and mortality from cancer, GEMS provides a robust two-year predoctoral training program that leverages HCI
research strengths in cancer genetics and epigenetics, cancer modeling, and cancer cell signaling, plus
integrates trainee interactions with cancer patients, cancer clinicians, and our Disease Centers, to provide
broad multidisciplinary training in cancer biology. The program goal is to prepare young scientists who are
broadly trained in cancer biology and well-versed in multidisciplinary research approaches for impactful and
rewarding opportunities in cancer-focused post-doctoral fellowships or other cancer-related research-intensive
career paths. We have carefully selected 28 experienced HCI members to serve as training faculty, with an
additional 12 promising junior faculty as associate mentors. The GEMS program will support six predoctoral
candidates per year. Trainees will be recruited into mentor’s laboratories after entering the University of Utah
(U of U) via graduate programs in Molecular Biology, Biological Chemistry, Public Health, and Population
Health Science. The program will also recruit students from our MD-PhD program. These graduate programs
recruit an average of 69 students annually, ensuring a deep pool of potential GEMS participants. GEMS
trainees will be selected based on their academic performance, promise as cancer researchers, and
commitment to transdisciplinary cancer training. Training in the GEMS program includes courses in basic and
clinical cancer biology and cancer-focused electives. To complement these didactic courses, our trainees will
have multiple opportunities to understand cancer from a clinical and patient-centric perspective. These
opportunities include broad exposure to cancer as a disease, including interactions with patients, exposure to
different operational units within HCI, physician shadowing, and attendance at Treatment Planning
Conferences. These activities are buttressed by Research-In-Progress presentations, a career development
series, and participation at an annual GEMS trainee retreat. The GEMS program is strengthened by optional
training activities, including a Master of Science in Clinical Investigation and a certificate in Genome Sciences.
GEMS trainees will receive experimental and career development advice, the latter guided by required
Individual Development Plans, from their mentor and their thesis committee. The GEMS leadership team will
receive guidance from an External Advisory Committee comprised of leaders of successful NCI T32 programs
and a Steering Committee comprised of U of U education leaders. We will use professional evaluation tools to
ensure the effectiveness of the GEMS program, and we will track trainees following completion of the program."

Environmental exposures affecting human health are traditionally associated with industrial sources in urban
environments, while exposures and associated health outcomes unique to rural landscapes have been less
emphasized in environmental health sciences training. To address this gap, the Rural Environmental Health
(REH) training program will leverage Virginia Tech’s strengths in agriculture, engineering, veterinary, and
natural resources research and outreach in rural areas to advance biomedical and public health training and
research. The REH program will provide predoctoral fellows with environmental health training in the areas of
toxicology, environmental epidemiology, exposure science, and risk assessment. Trainees will focus their
dissertation research within one of three focus areas: mechanisms of environmentally-mediated diseases
prevalent in rural areas, characterization of exposures in rural landscapes, or community-engaged approaches
to address environmental health priorities in rural areas. A total of six REH trainees will be recruited over the 5-
year funding period from participating PhD degree granting programs at Virginia Tech including: 1)
Translational Biology, Medicine, and Health, 2) Biomedical and Veterinary Sciences, 3) Environmental and
Water Resources Engineering, 4) Biological Systems Engineering, 5) Fish and Wildlife Conservation, and 6)
Biological Sciences. Over their 4 years of training, they will participate in formal coursework in environmental
health sciences, including toxicology, epidemiology, and exposure science, to gain depth in methodological
skills. REH trainees will gain team science and science communication skills, experience working at the
science-policy interface, and receive career planning guidance through participation in the Interfaces of Global
Change (IGC) Interdisciplinary Graduate Education Program. The IGC will expose them to the wide range of
global change research on interacting health threats from climate change and pollution in rural environments.
REH trainees’ will participate in a journal club led by REH leadership to build camaraderie, learn from each
other, and keep abreast of the relevant literature on rural environmental health. The REH program is supported
by a leadership team spanning four colleges (Medicine, Veterinary Medicine, Engineering, and Natural
Resources) and an additional 22 faculty mentors with cutting-edge interdisciplinary research programs funded
through grants from NIH and other federal agencies including NSF, USDA, and NASA. As a new program, the
leadership team has developed a mentoring and evaluation plan that includes multiple methods of independent
feedback from trainees, faculty mentors, and an external advisory board made up of directors of long-standing
NIEHS-funded training programs to guide progress and ensure the continued growth and success of the REH
trainees."

This project proposes to develop methods for automated, real-time, single-voxel magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (MRS) in brain tumors, integrate these methods with a clinical MRI system, evaluate their
performance, and make them available as open-source tools to the research community. MRS can provide
metabolic information noninvasively for assessment of tumor phenotype and therapeutic response. Single-
voxel MRS methods provide the best quality and most reliable data, but require the scanner operator to have a
high skill level and expertise to produce good quality results. The need for this expert involvement in both
acquisition and analysis remains a critical barrier to the translation of MRS methods to clinical research sites
without spectroscopy experts and to clinical practice. The first part of this project is to develop a method for 3D
voxel placement using image guidance, integrate this method with a clinical MR system, and evaluate its
performance. In the second part, we will automate our advanced MRS methods. In the third part, we will create
real-time, automatic quantification tool specific to the obtained MRS data that will provide clinically interpretable
results. In the final part, we will assess the performance of automated methods in prospective in vivo study.
Successful completion of this project will improve data robustness and quality, eliminating the need for the
expert interaction at the time of the scan and enabling adoption of MRS in multi-site clinical trials and clinical
practice."

The proposed K08 career development award will provide Dr. Conley with the training and mentorship necessary
to become an independent clinical scientist focused on leveraging multilevel approaches to support informed
decision making about risk-based cancer screening in diverse populations. She has identified decision-making
about screening breast MRI among high-risk Black and Latina women as a critical issue to address in order to
achieve this goal. This proposal describes a 5-year comprehensive program of training and mentored research
for an academic career at the intersection of medical decision making and risk-based cancer screening. This
K08 will provide key training in community engaged research, medical decision making, multilevel interventions,
and cancer risk prediction models. The intensive research experience provided by the K08 aims will provide the
opportunity to implement and practice the skills gained through the training goals. The primary objective of the
proposed research is to develop and test a multilevel intervention to support informed decision making about
screening breast MRI among high-risk Black and Latina women. Women at high risk for breast cancer (i.e., ≥20%
lifetime risk) can decide to supplement mammography screening with MRI or continue with mammography alone.
Some women will benefit from screening with breast MRI, though some will experience harms due to the higher
rate of biopsies, false-positive results, and higher costs. Thus, informed decision making about screening breast
MRI is critical for high-risk women. An informed decision is defined as a decision that is made with sufficient
knowledge, and is in line with the person’s preferences. To make informed decisions about screening breast
MRI, high-risk women must: (1) be identified as high risk; (2) be made aware that breast MRI is an option; (3)
understand MRI’s benefits and drawbacks; and (4) make a decision aligned with their preferences. However,
lack of awareness and access may prevent high-risk Black and Latina women from making an informed decision
about breast MRI. The study’s specific aims are: (1) develop and deliver a universal breast cancer risk assess-
ment protocol in a community setting; (2) develop a culturally-relevant decision aid with input from diverse stake-
holders; and (3) assess the effect of the multilevel decision support intervention (i.e., risk assessment + decision
aid) on informed decisions about breast MRI. Dr. Conley’s mentorship team – including world-renowned behav-
ioral scientists, clinical trialists, breast oncologists, epidemiologists, and biostatisticians – will provide guidance
to support her research aims and complement her didactic training. These factors, in addition to the supportive
research environment at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, will enable her to achieve the
proposed project aims. The proposed study will provide pilot data for a future R01 application to test the effec-
tiveness of this intervention in the NCI Community Oncology Research Program. Dr. Conley will also possess
the skills and experience to leverage multilevel approaches to support informed decision-making about risk-
based cancer screening in diverse populations. This will result in sustained and impactful scientific contributions."

In Aim 1 of the project we will establish the SPAN standard operating protocols and timeline for testing of the
interventions. In Aim 2, we will test the efficacy of candidate cerebroprotectants in multiple rodent models of
transient middle cerebral artery occlusion, including models incorporating aging and comorbidities. In an
exploratory Aim 3, we will test innovative methods to improve the predictive value of the SPAN testing
protocols to identify candidate treatments that will be efficacious in patients and enhance the impact of SPAN."

This mentored research project focuses on the intersection between two urgent and related threats to older
adults’ health and safety: Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) and elder mistreatment (EM).
Elder mistreatment (EM) prevalence estimates for older adults with cognitive impairment range from 27.5%-
55%. High prevalence of EM among persons with dementia (PWD) is unsurprising considering that many of
the risk factors for EM are related to dependency and caregiving. However, logistical and methodological
challenges as well as the high costs associated with studying mistreatment among PWD have contributed to a
dearth of research on the topic. Existing research has relied on small, cross-sectional studies and have not
provided the data required to produce evidence-based tools for EM screening and intervention tailored to the
growing population of PWD. This project will fill critical knowledge gaps by leveraging an already existing large
longitudinal dataset from UCLA’s Alzheimer’s and Dementia Care Program (ADC Program) to describe the
phenomenon of EM and identify modifiable risk factors for EM among PWD that can be applied in subsequent
intervention generation, refinement, and adaptation. Aim 1 is a qualitative study of expert dementia care
specialists (DCS) experiences with EM to inform revisions to a data abstraction tool used in Aim 2. Focus
groups with DCS from 16 clinical settings across the US will be conducted to examine: perspectives on EM
frequency, severity, and triggers; barriers and facilitators to identifying EM in patients with varying levels of
dementia severity; and ethical and practical implications of addressing EM. Aim 2 will describe EM type and
frequencies among a well-defined sample of PWD from the ADC program. To conduct the analyses, EM data
will be extracted from patient medical records and combined with existing sociodemographic and clinical
measures. Aim 3 will utilize the same ADC program dataset to characterize EM risk and protective factors
among patient/caregiver dyads using hierarchical logistic regression modeling comparing PWD who
experienced EM to those who did not. Kristin Lees Haggerty, PhD, a Project Director and researcher at
Education Development Center (EDC), is in an ideal position to lead this work. Dr. Lees Haggerty has an
academic background in population health and applied psychology, demonstrated productivity in aging
research, and a strong network of collaborators and mentors in academic, clinical, and community settings. Dr.
Lees Haggerty has developed a comprehensive training and mentorship plan that will prepare her to become
an independent investigator devoted to improving older adults’ health and safety. The training plan includes
course work and experiential learning opportunities addressing four key areas: ADRD research; clinical trial
design and implementation science; health care policy making; and manuscript and grant writing. The
interdisciplinary mentorship team includes national leaders with expertise in the identified training areas and
extensive experience mentoring junior investigators who are strongly committed to supporting Dr. Lees
Haggerty’s development into an independent investigator."
10624086,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Regulatory DNA encodes signals that are recognized by transcriptional regulators to drive development- and
stimulus-specific patterns of gene expression. While individual DNA binding sites recognized by transcription
factors are often short and promiscuous in the genome, functional regulatory elements usually contain several
closely spaced binding sites that specify the cooperative assembly of regulatory factors on DNA. Multiple lines
of evidence suggest the configuration of these binding sites, including their relative binding affinity, spacing and
orientation, play important roles in the context-dependent recruitment of RNA polymerase II to drive transcription.
Furthermore, regulatory elements do not function independently in the genome. Proper gene regulation often
depends on multiple regulatory elements scattered across gene loci that work in concert to enhance or silence
target promoters. Yet despite extensive research efforts, our understanding of how regulatory DNA is organized
is still rudimentary, limiting our ability to accurately model transcriptional networks and interpret the function of
genetic variants. My laboratory seeks answers to these fundamental biological questions using a combination of
experimental and computational approaches to decode regulatory DNA. Previous efforts to investigate the
function of regulatory regions have typically relied on indirect measurements of transcriptional activity, such as
the profiling of epigenetic markers, transcription factor binding, chromatin accessibility, or the expression of
nearby genes or reporters. We have found that precise measurements of transcription initiation, which record
the frequency and base positions where RNAPII initiates transcription, yield novel insights into the roles of
transcription factor motifs and other regulatory DNA features in regulating transcription. Transcription initiation
profiling also provides sensitive and precise measurements of activation at promoter-distal regulatory elements,
enabling us to track the functional interactions between promoter and enhancer elements in the genome in the
context of chromatin modifications and changes in 3D genome structure. Using these approaches we will explore
how transcription factors exert activating or inhibitory effects on individual transcription start sites (TSS),
depending on their spatial location within regulatory elements, and investigate how multiple regulatory elements
work together to drive the transcription of target genes. These studies will greatly expand the ruleset to interpret
how regulatory DNA and genetic variation affect gene regulation."

 The overarching goal of this chemistry is to develop new avenues in biomimetic transition metal chemistry as a
way of modelling metalloenzyme active sites. This work is divided into two sections. The first aims to evaluate the ability
of strong, local electrostatic fields in the secondary coordination sphere of a metal center to impact the metal’s electronic
structure and reactivity profile. Electrostatic fields play critical roles in enzymology, and recent computational studies
have provided the first indication that they operate at metalloenzymes. Lipoxygenases, blue copper proteins,
photosystem II, and both heme and non-heme Fe centers have been variously predicted to use local electrostatic fields to
facilitate electron transfer, proton transfer, or proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). Preliminary results from our
laboratory have mimicked the ability of enzymes to organize electric fields in a way that is advantageous to the active
site’s chemistry. This electrostatic preorganization in our molecular compounds was then shown to regulate both O2
binding to CuI ions and the rates of subsequent intermolecular PCET chemistry. The proposed research will first delineate
the extent to which electrostatic fields are able to gate PCET – a process of fundamental importance to metabolism.
Unexpected trends in the preliminary data hint at interesting electrostatic field effects that will need to be investigated in
a systematic fashion. Next, the use of secondary coordination sphere electrostatic effects will be explored for their ability
to stabilize key intermediates that have been proposed to develop during O2 processing at various monocopper sites in
biology. Electrostatic effects are expected to provide a useful shift in the energy landscape for stabilizing these species.
Lastly, a new approach will be developed for identifying secondary coordination sphere electrostatic effects with X-ray
absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory, based on the expectation that oriented electrostatic fields will
tune the energies and intensities of XAS acceptor states. The broad scope of this section of the research program is
intended to improve our ability to identify, tune, and use electrostatic fields in molecular transition metal systems, as is
needed for creating effective biomimetics. In the second section of this research program, we will investigate the ability
of constrained geometry cluster compounds to effect biologically relevant N2 fixation chemistry. Many metalloenzymes
use multinuclear active sites for small molecule activation, but efforts to mimic their structures and catalytic activities
have lagged, with most relying on mononuclear transition metal complexes. Recent developments in the study of the
nitrogenase enzymes have identified constrained geometry dinuclear sites as the likely locations for N2 fixation. In
preliminary investigations, we have made use of a ligand system that is able to constrain the positions of two metal centers
housed within a macrocyclic framework. The diiron version of this complex has been shown to form a number of species
that are relevant to mechanisms that have been put forward for N2 fixation at the nitrogenase enzymes. The proposed
work will perform a step-by-step investigation into the ability of constrained geometry diiron sites to shuttle nitrogenous
substrates along an N2 reduction pathway. Together, these two sections are expected to advance our understanding of
ways in which metalloenzymes perform some of the most challenging transformations in biology."
10854888,"Project Summary/Abstract
Nearly all cells in our bodies contain the same genome, and thus each of them has the capacity to adopt one of
many cell identities. Normal development is characterized by progressive restriction in cell identity from
multipotent progenitor cells toward terminally differentiated cells. Most cells choose a single identity and maintain
it over time. However, defects in cell fate determination or maintenance can allow cells to escape the restrictions
on cell identity, endowing them with new properties that cause disease. For this reason, the steps leading to
disease have been described as development gone awry. More importantly, it suggests that cells proceed down
the path to disease by inappropriately accessing genetic information controlling cell identity. Thus, studying the
mechanisms controlling access to genetic information during normal development can inform how deregulation
of these mechanisms contributes to disease. My lab studies two different regulatory layers controlling access to
DNA-encoded information and their importance in controlling gene expression. Research during the term of this
grant will interrogate the mechanisms underlying (1) how chromatin-based packaging of transcriptional
enhancers determines where and when transcription factors bind DNA to switch genes on or off, and (2) how
modifications of histone proteins contribute to chromatin organization and transcriptional control. DNA is wrapped
around histone proteins to form nucleosomes, the repeating unit of chromatin. Nucleosomes are barriers to
transcription factor binding, inhibiting early steps of gene activation. Thus, understanding how chromatin is made
accessible to transcription factors is necessary for understanding gene control. More importantly, returning open
chromatin to a closed state and reinstating this barrier is critical for preventing gene activation at the wrong time
or place. However, the mechanisms controlling chromatin closing are uncharacterized. We have uncovered a
temporal cascade of transcription factors, which we term “chromatin gatekeepers” due to their requirement for
opening and closing access to enhancers, that we study to decipher these mechanisms. We will also investigate
how information about decisions made earlier in development is propagated over time. A key to unlocking this
question is a unique genetic resource we recently generated that enables us to directly test the function of
histones. Histones are subject to a diverse array of post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are thought to
carry epigenetic information to control DNA-templated processes, including transcription. However, evidence
supporting the role of histone PTMs in animals is largely correlative due to the difficulty in creating mutant histone
genotypes in animals. Drosophila is distinct among animal models in that the histone genes reside at a single
locus in the genome. We can replace the endogenous histone genes with tailor-made versions, thereby providing
us with the first opportunity to distinguish between regulatory information that is directly encoded in the DNA
sequence and information that is epigenetically propagated. We will employ this approach to interrogate the role
that histone PTMs play in transcriptional regulation and in control of 3D genome organization."
10840880,"The immune checkpoint blockade cancer therapy (ICB) can greatly prolong survival in responders.
However, significant improvement of the response rate of ICB is in urgent need. We have found that IL33 is
expressed in normal epithelial cells of lining tissues such as lung and skin but drastically down-regulated in high-
grade tumor cells in multiple human carcinomas. These clinical data support the notion that down-regulation of
IL33 is a major mechanism of tumor immune evasion. How IL-33 contributes to responses to current ICB therapy
is not explored. Interestingly, our bioinformatics analysis revealed that the IL33 receptor ST2 mRNA is
upregulated in human tumor tissues after successful PD-1 blockade treatment. Using mouse models, we showed
that the IL33/ST2 signaling was required for therapeutic effect of ICB therapy. In addition, we demonstrated that
IL33 was highly induced in immunogenic murine tumor cells during ICB tumor therapy and tumor-expressed IL33
was required for responses to ICB therapy. Despite these strong evidence supporting an antitumor function of
both endogenous and administered IL33, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are not well
understood. Our preliminary data showed that ICB-induced tumor-expressed IL33 drove conspicuous immune
cell re-organization in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We further demonstrated that the antitumor effect of
IL33 is dependent on DC1 and CD8+ T cells, suggesting their role in anchoring the antitumor effect of IL33.
Interestingly, IL33 also led to accumulation of ST2+ Treg cells in the TME, which might counteract the antitumor
effect of IL33 and maintain an immune equilibrium. We hypothesize that tumor-derived IL33 underpins responses
to ICB tumor immunotherapy through promoting a drastic reorganization of the immune cellular network in the
TME. SA1 Determine how IL33 expression is induced in tumor cells by ICB tumor therapy. SA2. We will define
how IL33 organizes the immune cellular network that mediates responses to ICB tumor therapy. SA3. Determine
the mechanisms how ST2 signaling in regulatory T cells (Tregs) limits antitumor activities of IL33."
10839971,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Protein kinases are a large family of ubiquitous signaling enzymes in human cells. Their
dysregulation often underlies diseases such as cancer, making them excellent therapeutic targets. However, the
high structural and sequence conservation of the protein kinase catalytic domains has complicated the
development of specific inhibitors. Many clinically-successful kinase inhibitors achieve specificity in part by
binding only to distinct kinase conformations. While the analysis of thousands of X-ray crystal structures of
protein kinases has shown that a single kinase domain can access different active and inactive conformations,
little is known about how kinases interconvert between the conformations. The rationale of this proposal is that
a quantitative understanding of the stability of these conformations and the dynamics of their interconversion are
key to understanding kinase activity, regulation, ligand binding and drug resistance in health and disease states.
The objective of this project is to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the role of conformational dynamics
in kinase function, regulation and drug resistance through altered drug dissociation rates. This proposal is part
of a continuum of research centered around three questions:
Q1: How do regulatory domains, interacting proteins and disease-relevant mutations affect the conformational
dynamics of tyrosine kinases? Our goal is to determine how the solution dynamics of Src kinase domain
responds to these biologically important perturbations.
Q2: What are the molecular and cellular determinants of ligand-binding kinetics? We will test our computational
model for the drug binding process experimentally, both in vitro and in cells, by assessing drug affinities and
binding and dissociation kinetics. Our goal is to determine quantitative parameters for the drug binding process
and how the alteration of these parameters by mutation underlies drug resistance.
Q3: How can phenotypic clustering of inhibition data be used to reveal hidden kinase features? Our goal is to
mine kinome-wide inhibition datasets to group kinases by their inhibition phenotype, which reflects on the
evolutionary pressure and adaption that other biological functions impose on kinases.
We will use structural approaches (X-ray and NMR), cellular drug binding and activity assays, ligand binding
kinetics, protein engineering, chemical biology and diverse computational methods. A network of productive
collaborations supports this project. The impact of this project is to provide clinicians with the mechanism of
resistance mutations, medicinal chemists with kinase inhibitor pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics and
cell biologists with parameters to understand kinase signaling. The long-term goal is to lay the foundation for the
design of safe, effective, and sufficiently specific inhibitors of disease-associated protein kinases."
10895283,"SUMMARY
Different regulatory pathways work together to coordinate gene expression, and our guiding philosophy
has been that exploring the interface of different types of regulation is thus a good way to discover new
and important biology. Building on discoveries from our previous MIRA award, we propose to focus on
understanding how different strategies for post-transcriptional regulation—mRNA decay, translation, and
protein decay—act together to control gene expression.
 In the ﬁrst of our two themes, we will explore the idea that protein decay acts as a meta-regulator
of the post-transcriptional landscape of the early embryo. Using Drosophila melanogaster as a model
system, we will investigate one of the earliest steps of development, the maternal-to-zygotic transition.
During this process, maternal gene products are replaced with zygotic ones, and we have discovered
that removal of three maternal RNA binding proteins is critical and determined how their destruction is
developmentally controlled. We propose to extend this line of investigation to other RNA binding proteins
that are destroyed by distinct and unknown mechanisms in the early embryo. We want to answer three
critical questions: what are the mechanisms by which these other RNA binding proteins are destroyed?
How is their degradation developmentally controlled? How does their degradation in turn change post-
transcription regulation? Our research is signiﬁcant because our results will reveal how destruction of
maternal proteins shapes the regulatory landscape of the early embryo, and they will likely provide a
conceptual framework applicable to other types of developmental transitions.
 In the second theme, we will explore how the open reading regulates mRNA decay and
translation. Poor (or “nonoptimal”) codons lead to reduced protein output, and understanding the
underlying mechanisms remains an open area of research for the ﬁeld. We have excitingly found that
nonoptimal codon usage represses translation initiation in human cells. This pathway is at least as potent
as previously described pathways like mRNA decay. Our proposed program will build upon these results
at a mechanistic level and will answer the following three important questions: What is the role of the
poly(A) in translational repression due to nonoptimal codons? What factors mediate translational
repression? How does codon-mediated regulation change during early development? This last question
represents a new direction for our lab and leverages our unique combination of skills in the Drosophila
MZT and codon-mediated regulation. Our research will reveal the molecular basis for a major repressive
pathway mediated by nonoptimal codons. The systems we establish have the potential to reveal other
types of developmentally-coordinated translational control, and we anticipate that our research will
provide a launching point to explore the how gene regulation changes in biological space and time."
10815830,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Metalloproteins containing Mn and Fe in a redox-active role are involved in a variety of physiologically
important reactions of dioxygen metabolism and activation. Perhaps the most complex is the Mn4CaO5 cluster
that is involved in the oxidation of water to dioxygen in photosystem II (PS II), a multi-subunit membrane protein
complex. The water-oxidation reaction in PS II involves removal of four electrons from two water molecules, in a
stepwise manner by light-induced oxidation, to produce a molecule of oxygen. PS II and the Mn4CaO5 cluster
generate almost all of the dioxygen that supports aerobic life, and it is abundant in the atmosphere because of
its constant regeneration by the oxidation of water. The light-induced oxidation of water to dioxygen is one of the
most important chemical processes occurring on such a large scale in the biosphere.
 Although the structure of PS II and the chemistry at the catalytic site have been studied intensively,
understanding the sequence in the chemistry at atomic-scale from light absorption to water-oxidation requires a
new approach beyond the conventional steady state X-ray crystallography and X-ray spectroscopy at cryogenic
temperatures. Following the dynamic changes in the structure of PS II and the Mn4CaO5 cluster at ambient
conditions at physiological temperatures, while overcoming the severe X-ray damage to the redox active center
is key for deriving the mechanism. The very intense, ultra-short femtosecond (fs) X-ray pulses from a X-ray free
electron laser (XFEL) provide an opportunity to overcome the current limitations in room temperature data
collection for biological samples at traditional X-ray sources. The fs X-ray pulses allow us to acquire the signal
before the sample is destroyed, thus making the light-induced snapshot study possible.
 The objective of this proposal is to study the protein structure and dynamics of PS II with X-ray diffraction, as
well as the chemical structure and changes in the Mn4CaO5 cluster (charge and spin density, and covalency)
with X-ray spectroscopy during the light-driven process of PS II. We will use the XFEL facilities at Stanford and
elsewhere to collect X-ray diffraction and emission spectra simultaneously, and X-ray absorption spectra of the
Mn cluster in its native and intermediates states at room temperature in a time-resolved manner, to capture
short-lived intermediates and the step that includes the O-O bond formation. We have also started studying the
chemistry of other Mn/Fe/Ni containing metalloenzymes of importance such as methane monooxgygenase,
ribonucleotide reductase, isopenicillin N synthase and other related enzymes.
 These studies have the potential to provide an unprecedented combination of correlated data between the
proteins and the metal co-factors, providing the geometric and electronic structure and the changes that occur
during the catalytic cycle, all of which are necessary for a complete understanding of the mechanism of the
enzymatic reactions."

10828732,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our chromosomes are constantly bombarded with a variety of insults, resulting in damage that
must be repaired. Cells have evolved mechanisms to detect and repair broken strands of DNA,
thereby preventing loss of important genetic information. Double‐stranded DNA breaks (DSBs)
are a type of damage that lead to particularly disastrous outcomes. If not corrected, DSBs can
cause gross chromosomal rearrangements, which are the hallmark of all forms of cancer.
 Homologous recombination (HR) is a conserved pathway that cells can use to repair DSBs,
and HR is necessary to prevent and repair the damage that arises during DNA replication. When
a DSB occurs, the DNA ends are processed to generate 3' single‐strand DNA (ssDNA) overhangs.
The ssDNA ends then pair with homologous sequence elsewhere in the genome, and the missing
DNA is replaced using the homologous DNA as a template for replication. Finally, the replicated
intermediate is resolved, regenerating the continuity of the broken DNA. HR requires the
coordinated action of a complex repertoire of proteins, which are responsible for sensing damage,
recruiting essential factors, and processing and repairing the damaged DNA. The consequences
of disrupting HR are devastating. For example, mutations in the RAD51 recombinase are
embryonic lethal in mice, and mutations in human RAD51 are linked to breast cancers. In
addition, defects in BRCA2 account for at least 5% of all breast cancers and also confer a genetic
predisposition to ovarian cancer. BRCA2 is thought to help regulate HR, and loss of this
regulation may be the reason why this gene is linked to hereditary cancers. New discoveries will
be necessary to fully understand the mechanistic basis for these outcomes.
 Our research program is focused on understanding how proteins sense and respond to
damaged DNA and they then repair the damaged DNA to prevent mutations that can lead to
cancer. To help address these problems we have developed unique technologies that allow us to
directly visualize hundreds of individual molecules using optical microscopy, which enables us
to monitor the spatial and temporal progression of DNA repair and DNA replication in real‐time
at the single‐molecule level. Using this approach, we seek to define the fundamental mechanisms
that our cells use to replicate and repair DNA, with the long‐term goal of understanding how
errors during these processes can lead to chromosomal rearrangements."

10881678,"The overall goal of this Research Career Scientist award is to foster the nominee’s ongoing research program
that is focused on the study of extracellular vesicles (EVs) and their extracellular RNA (exRNA) cargo as
biomarkers and effectors of human health and disease including among Veterans. Through participation in a
national NIH-funded consortium research program, the nominee is working to develop novel methods to study
EVs and other carriers of exRNA for biomarker development projects. The nominee also recently reported the
first evidence of intercellular signaling between macrophage EVs and hematopoietic progenitor cells to control
the process of systemic and vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease.
Ongoing funding from a VA Merit grant is supporting the nominee’s goal of exploring the role of circulating EVs
isolated from Veterans treated for advanced vascular disease as biomarkers and contributors to disease
progression including via microRNA cargo. Experiments in the lab will also test if EVs produced from anti-
inflammatory macrophages can serve to control inflammation and atherosclerosis in diabetic rodent models.
Furthermore, funding from a VA Invention-based Supplement Award will support pre-clinical studies testing such
anti-inflammatory EVs as therapeutics to control cardiac inflammation and heart failure in a rodent model system
developed and patented for the VA by the nominee. Findings from these studies could provide much needed
new therapeutics in the form of EV-biologics to treat inflammatory diseases including in the cardiovascular
system that is a major healthcare need among the Veteran patient population.
The nominee’s internationally recognized program on EV biology has led to new collaborative research projects
with VA clinician investigators at the local and offsite stations. This includes a collaborative project to test EVs
produced by cultured stem cells as therapeutic mediators of skeletal muscle regeneration. Such studies have
been proposed in a VA Merit grant proposal with the nominee serving as co-Investigator, which is being revised
for a resubmission. The nominee is also engaged in collaborative studies with VA clinician investigators to
develop biomarkers of adverse outcomes of surgical procedures used to treat advanced vascular disease among

outcomes of COVID19 disease. It also includes developing new forms of engineered EVs designed to serve in
improving host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 viral infection as well as to control lung inflammation.
Together, the award will serve to sustain the nominee’s momentum to developing a first-in-class research

Research Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs at two distinct levels: first as a
Research Physiologist who makes cutting-edge discoveries on molecular cellular mechanisms
of liver fibrosis and cancer; and secondly as a Center Director of the P50 national center
program on alcoholic liver and pancreatic diseases (ALPD) and cirrhosis who renders concrete
and outcome-oriented support for scientific endeavors of VA investigators regionally and across
the nation.
 He published 71 peer-review articles in the last 10 years and maintained federal grants with
total current direct costs exceeding $1.1M per year (not inclusive of all center components). He
has made major contributions to new knowledge concerning morphogen-mediated regulation of
cell fate of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), hepatic macrophages, and tumor-initiating stem-like
cells (TICs), the cell types shown to play critical roles in liver fibrosis, inflammation, and cancer,
respectively. In these regulations, novel modes of metabolic reprogramming were disclosed as
underlying mechanisms. More specifically, Notch-mediated proinflammatory M1 activation of
liver macrophages is causally linked to mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming (J Clin Invest
2015;125:1579-90). Wnt-induced activation of HSCs is mediated by lipid metabolic
reprogramming involving stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD) (Gastroenterology 2017;152:1477-91).
Further, SCD expressed by HSCs is shown to achieve tumor-promoting lipid reprogramming in
microenvironment to enhance liver tumor progression.
 Programmatically, he continues to direct a nationally renowned P50 center program on
alcoholic liver and pancreatic diseases and a R24 core program on integrative liver cell
techniques which support leading-edge ALPD research. Through these programs, he
collaborated and supported 12 VA investigators and mentored 10 junior faculty members during
the current cycle of the VARCS award.

10881680,"Bile duct epithelial cells (i.e., cholangiocytes) are the target cells in cholangiopathies such as primary biliary
cholangitis (PBC), primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), which are
diseases characterized by the damage, proliferation and neoplastic transformation of cholangiocytes.
These cholestatic liver diseases (characterized by coordinated proliferation/damage of biliary epithelial
cells) along with other cholangiopathies represent a major clinical challenge due to the lack of effective
therapeutic interventions resulting in the need for liver transplantation during end-stage liver disease.
Management of cholangiopathies (including drug- or viral-induced liver injury) represents one of the major
challenges for Veterans Health. Targeting the neuroendocrine factors that respond to cholestasis resulting
from tissue injury may help limit inflammation and fibrosis that occur during hepatobiliary damage. There
is a critical need to understand the neuroendocrine triggers of cholangiocyte growth and their responses
to damage during cholestasis, which will help identify key signaling pathways that represent viable targets
for the development of effective therapeutic agents. Our long-term research goal is to develop an
understanding of the neuroendocrine factors and signaling mechanisms regulating biliary growth during
cholestasis, fatty liver and alcohol-induced liver disease, which will provide a foundation for the discovery
of prevention and new pharmaceutical interventions for cholangiopathies and liver diseases characterized
by hepatic fibrosis. For my current funded VA Merit Award, the central hypothesis is based upon the
postulate that the secretin/secretin receptor (Sct/SR) axis signaling is key for mediating the proliferative
and activated profibrogenic biliary phenotype that contributes to the progression of hepatic steatosis and
fibrosis during the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH). In addition, my research program is funded by multiple collaborative NIH R01 grants that explore
various aspects of the regulation of biliary growth and hepatic fibrosis by neuroendocrine factors such as
secretin, melatonin, serotonin and miRNAs in models of cholestasis, NAFLD, and alcohol-induce liver
disease. My collaborative effort with multiple VA investigators has been high productive and has resulted
in many publications in high impact journals. The exploration of the neuroendocrine features of
cholangiocytes will provide new avenues for the development of therapeutic interventions for these
diseases. Our contribution is significant since this is a critical step to provide translational knowledge for
the development of therapies for cholangiopathies. These findings will also have broader implications for
other hepatic diseases characterized by hepatic fibrosis."
10835901,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), once rarely observed in children and
adolescents, is now the most common form of liver disease in this age group. If untreated, NAFLD can
progress rapidly from simple fat infiltration to advanced stages of the disease including steatohepatitis, fibrosis,
and cirrhosis ultimately requiring liver transplantation. It has been reported that approximately 20% of patients
with NASH will progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. However, patients with NAFLD universally have hepatic
insulin resistance placing them at high risk of developing glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The
pathogenesis of hepatic insulin resistance is closely tied to lipid accumulation, suggesting that depletion of
hepatic lipid is critical in the prevention of T2D in pediatric populations. Currently, no pharmaceutical treatment
exists to directly reverse NAFLD and limited progress has been made to identify effective, non-invasive
treatment. Because lifestyle changes remain the mainstay therapy for children with NAFLD, there is urgent
need for evidenced-based guidelines on the optimal dietary approaches to safely and effectively reverse
disease course. If fatty liver and insulin resistance can be reversed during the developmental adolescent
years, it may be possible to prevent progression of the disease to advanced stages and prevent occurrence of
other diseases such as T2D and CVD. Our preliminary data in 23 adolescents with NAFLD suggest that a
weight-maintaining, low glycemic, moderately CHO-restricted diet (~100 g CHO/day) significantly improves
both hepatic steatosis and hepatic insulin sensitivity. After 8 weeks, we found the CHO-restricted diet resulted
in significant reduction in hepatic lipid content (-6.0±4.7%, p<0.001), whereas no change in hepatic lipid was
observed in the fat-restricted (control) diet group. HOMA-IR, an index of hepatic insulin resistance, was
reduced (improved) (-1.2±5.1, <0.05) in the CHO-restricted group, and increased (worsened) slightly in the fat-
restricted (control) diet group. While these results are encouraging, this study needs to be verified in a larger
sample before translation to clinical practice can be recommended. It is also critical to measure hepatic insulin
sensitivity using accepted, rigorous methods to determine if the reduction in hepatic lipid is associated with
improvement in hepatic insulin sensitivity. Further, data identifying the changes in biological processes, such
as de novo lipogenesis, β-oxidation and lipid metabolism, that lead to depletion in liver fat in response to a
energy balanced CHO-restricted diet in the absence of significant weight loss in pediatric populations are
needed. The proposed study will address these gaps in knowledge using a 6 month family-based intervention
with 2 phases, a 12-week controlled feeding phase and a 12-week free living phase, to examine the effects of
two weight maintaining diets (moderately CHO-restricted vs fat-restricted diet) on depletion of hepatic lipid
content, improvement in hepatic insulin sensitivity, and changes in the plasma metabolome in adolescents with
NAFLD."
10839763,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This research program will investigate the general hypothesis that understanding the conformational diversity
of proteins will provide new insights into their biology, and enable medical research. It is directed to two
classes of systems: Integral Membrane Proteins (IMPs) and viral-host interactions. IMPs play critical roles as
gate keepers, receptors, transporters, homeostasis regulators, and drug targets. These functions are mediated
by the conformational plasticity of the IMP in the membrane environment. IMPs are challenging to prepare, and
even more challenging to reconstitute in appropriate membrane mimicking environments. Cost-effective
technologies for isotope-enrichment in condensed volumes, hybrid approaches combining NMR with
evolutionary co-variation (ECs), novel methods of contact prediction, and innovative modeling methods from
the protein structure prediction community, will be applied to structure-function studies of IMPs. These IMPs,
chosen from important human pathogens, including E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa, are potential
targets for antibiotic discovery. ECs will also be combined with NMR data to determine structures of multiple
“native states” of proteins. The second component of our program is directed to viral – host biomolecular
complexes, and antiviral drug discovery. We will utilize innovative paramagnetic NMR methods, together with
small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), electron-electron double resonance spectroscopy (DEER), and Förster
resonance energy transfer (FRET), to rigorously define dynamic interdomain structural distributions conferred
by the partially-ordered linkers of the murine Moloney Leukemia Virus (MLV) integrase (IN). These data will be
interpreted in the context of maximum occupancy probabilities (MaxOcc), and used to probe the role(s) of this
flexibility in the gene integration mechanisms of g-retroviruses. Interdomain linkers also function to provide
flexibility needed for binding partner promiscuity. We will also determine how the interdomain linker sequences
of influenza Non-Structural Protein 1 (NS1) confer appropriate plasticity to define its specificity and affinity for
host proteins and RNAs. This structural and functional promiscuity underlies NS1’s mechanisms for
suppressing the cellular innate immune response to influenza infection, and rigorous characterization of its
dynamic structural basis will provide fundamental information for live-attenuated virus vaccine development.
We will also apply our platform to investigate drugs that inhibit SARS-CoV2 virus by binding its main protease
(Mpro). We have identified three drugs, already approved for use in humans, originally designed to inhibit the
NSP3/4A protease of hepatitis C virus, that also inhibit SARS-CoV2 in viral replication assays at low
micromolar concentrations. Our computational docking studies have also identified several other FDA-
approved drugs that may inhibit Mpro. Enzyme kinetic, biophysical chemistry, and X-ray crystallography studies
will be used to characterize complexes formed between these protease inhibitor drugs and Mpro, and to
develop their potential as COVID-19 therapeutics, or as lead compounds for new therapeutic development."

(CVD) and various CVD risk factors are strongly associated with incidence of dementia. Vascular risk factors
are easily identifiable and often modifiable. Therefore, discovery of vascular risk factors that precede CVD and
cognitive impairment or decline would significantly enhance our understanding of the vascular etiology of
ADRD. Heart rate variability (HRV) and QT interval variability (QTV), derived from electrocardiogram (ECG)
analysis, are well-known indices of autonomic control over the heart. Lower HRV and higher QTV, indicating
worse cardiac autonomic function, are strongly predictive of future cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
Notably, lower HRV and QT abnormalities have been noted in ADRD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
Thus, the study of HRV and QTV may provide valuable insight into the role of cardiac autonomic function in the
development of dementia. However, in most studies HRV and QTV are derived from standard short-term ECG
(ranging from 10 seconds to several minutes duration), which does not reflect real-world conditions due to the
requirement of stationarity. Although wearable devices such as Zio XT Patch allow ECG recording of up to 14
days duration, methods used to analyze HRV and QTV are based on the stationarity assumption, resulting in
measures that may be uninterpretable or misleading when applied to such extra long-term recordings. Thus,
innovative signal analysis tools are required to utilize the full potential of these ECGs. Recently, a new signal
processing method was developed specifically to derive novel measures of HRV and QTV from extra long-term
ECG that better represent cardiac autonomic function in real-world settings. The primary goal of this K01
mentored career development award is to implement this innovative analysis tool in a large, ongoing cohort
study of older adults to derive novel measures of HRV and QTV from recently collected 14-day Zio Patch
recordings. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the association of these novel measures with cognitive performance and
risk of prevalent or incident MCI or dementia. In Aim 2, we will determine if their diurnal variation is related to
worse cognitive performance or risk of MCI or dementia. Finally, we will leverage recent neuroimaging data in
a subset of participants to determine if extra long-term HRV or QTV is associated with neuroimaging
biomarkers of ADRD or cerebrovascular disease. If successful, the proposed study may provide insight into the
mechanisms linking vascular risk factors and CVD to ADRD, and potentially identify cardiac autonomic function
as a modifiable intervention target. In addition, this K01 award will provide the resources necessary to support
the Candidate’s transition to an independent research career in an area of growing public health importance."

Epigenetic mechanisms play a pivotal role in aging and are found disregulated in age-related
disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. The major indicator of alterations
occurred in chromatin during aging is acetylation of lysine 16 of histone H4 (H4K16ac), a
modification that is redistributed and raised in the healthy aged brain but is considerably lost in
Alzheimer’s disease. On the molecular level, H4K16ac is involved in a wide array of fundamental
cellular processes, including higher-order chromatin decompaction and folding, DNA damage
repair, and gene expression. Despite the high importance of H4K16ac, very little is known about
protein ligands that bind this mark. Our recent studies identified the plant homeodomain finger 6
of the histone methyltransferase MLL4 (MLL4PHD6) as a selective effector (or reader) of H4K16ac.
The molecular mechanism underlying the recognition of H4K16ac by MLL4 is unknown and will
be elucidated in the proposed studies. We hypothesize that the selective targeting of H4K16ac
by MLL4 at specific genomic sites is necessary for transcriptional activation of MLL4 target genes
and that this interaction provides a novel functional link between MLL4 that methylates lysine 4 of
histone H3 (H3K4) and the acetyltransferase MOF that produces H4K16ac. We seek to define
the molecular basis and functional significance of the previously uncharacterized crosstalk
between vital histone marks. These studies are fundamental to our understanding of physiological
activities associated with ‘writing and reading’ H4K16ac and are also essential to better
understand the etiology of human age-related illnesses, including AD and other
neurodegenerative disorders."
10831409,"ABSTRACT
Antibiotics are given universally to treat Crohn’s disease, especially with perianal fistulizing complications (PFC),
which occur in about 1/3 of children. Decreasing the utilization is challenging, yet significant, as many guidelines
support the use of antibiotics as first-line despite a lack of research showing benefit. Furthermore, there is such
variation in treatment not only regarding antibiotic use but also around use of other medications, interventions
such as drainage, and timing of each of these. In this innovative proposal, the investigators evaluate the current
practices for management of PFC in Crohn’s disease at seven large pediatric institutions, develop a protocol to
guide antibiotic stewardship, and improve care through a multidisciplinary approach (pediatric gastroenterology,
surgery, infectious disease, radiology, and nursing) and prospective implementation arm for data collection and
evaluation of barriers and facilitators. Our central hypothesis is that antibiotic use for PFC in Crohn’s disease
can be reduced, and outcomes improved through standardization of multidisciplinary care of children. The
rationale for this project is that reduction in antibiotic use and providing higher quality care will reduce the risk of
developing healthcare-associated infections such as clostridioides difficile, acquiring resistant organisms, and
improved care will also reduce the risk of perianal abscess development or fistula recurrence among pediatric
patients with Crohn’s disease. We will test our hypothesis through the specific aims: 1) describe variation in
antibiotic use and treatment of PFCs among pediatric patients with Crohn’s disease at seven children’s hospitals;
2) develop evidence-based protocols through multidisciplinary, multicenter collaboration aimed at antibiotic
reduction and standardization of PFC care; and 3) implement the protocols for antibiotic stewardship and
prospectively evaluate the barriers and facilitators with shared insight of best practices for pediatric Crohn’s
disease. This approach will create an evidence-base for antibiotic utilization while standardizing the care for
pediatric Crohn’s disease at several institutions with prospective evaluation of outcomes. The proposed research
is innovative because it brings together multidisciplinary teams from multiple institutions to develop a shared
approach to improving care, that is currently not standardized, or evidence-based. The proposed study is
significant because it has the potential to change the paradigm for pediatric multidisciplinary care of complex
conditions beyond pediatric Crohn’s disease."
10802406,"ABSTRACT: Transplantation of Cryopreserved Thymus
Advances in immunosuppression have improved patient outcomes after transplantation, but also place
patients at risk of life-threatening infection and end-organ failure. Development of immune tolerance to the
donor that eliminates the need for continuing immunosuppression would likely improve patient survival. Our
pivotal prior work showed that cultured thymus tissue implantation (CTTI) into athymic humans can
establish an immune system that is tolerant to antigens present on the donor thymus, while maintaining
tolerance to recipient native tissue. We have extended these findings to reprogram the immune system of
immunocompetent rats to recognize a transplanted donor heart as “self” using CTTI combined with
transplantation of heart from the same donor. In August 2021, our team performed the first human
CTTI/heart co-transplantation under eIND. The recipient is currently robustly producing naïve T cells within
the implanted donor thymus and testing for tolerance is pending. However, a major hurdle to translating this
approach more widely is that CTTI using freshly cultured thymus must occur between 12-21 days post-
thymus/heart harvest. Development of strategies to preserve the reconstitution potential of donor thymus
slices beyond 12-21 days would allow CTTI to be delayed until recipients are clinically stable and could
eventually extend the benefits of CTTI to all recipients via banked, donor-matched thymus. Our team has
developed methods for cryopreservation and thawing of cultured thymus tissue from both pigs and humans
that appear to maintain its viability, while continuing to meet CTTI quality criteria. This proposal aims to
determine the ability of cryopreserved cultured thymus tissue implantation (cCTTI) to re-establish thymus
function and naïve T cell numbers in thymectomized and conditioned recipient pigs. These studies will
leverage our unparalleled expertise as the only institution performing clinical CTTI in the Western
hemisphere to provide critical proof of concept for using cryopreserved thymus to induce immune tolerance
in the setting of human thymus-heart co-transplantation."
10848218,"The objective of the proposed research is to obtain scientific knowledge of visuomotor transformations
in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and primary motor cortex (M1) from tetraplegic subjects in a clinical
trial to advance the development of neural prosthetics. We have shown in clinical trials conducted over
the past 6 years that PPC can control neural prosthetics for assisting tetraplegic subjects. Other groups
have concentrated on M1 and likewise find control for neural prosthetics. In our studies of PPC we have
found that besides trajectory signals to move robotic limbs or control computer cursors, there are a
plethora of visuomotor signals that represent intended movements of most of the body, movement
goals, cognitive strategies, and even memory signals. Our central hypothesis is that PPC and M1 will
encode visuomotor parameters in both similar and different ways, and that algorithms can be
developed to leverage those signals from the two areas that are complimentary to improve prosthetic
range and performance. Implants will be made in both M1 and PPC, enabling simultaneous recording in
the same subjects, elevating concerns of comparing data from different labs collected in different
individuals with different implants and different tasks.
This central hypothesis will be tested in two broad aims, for which we have substantial preliminary data.
Aim 1 will examine the control of the body by the two areas. It is hypothesized that M1 will
demonstrate strong specificity for the contralateral limb (implants will be made in the hand knob)
whereas PPC will code movements for most of the body and on both contra and ipsilateral sides by
leveraging its partially mixed encoding of parameters (subaim 1a). Whereas M1 is hypothesized to code
spatial variables exclusively during attempted or imagined actions, it is hypothesized that PPC also
encodes cognitive spatial variables in task appropriate reference frames (subaim 1b). In subaim 1c we
will examine how multiple body parts are combined in movement representations, hypothesizing that
M1 and PPC will employ a diverse set of mechanisms including linear summation, non-linear
combinations, and movement suppression expressed in different ways as a function of brain area and
the specific movement set.
Aim 2 will examine the temporal aspects of encoding in the two areas. In subaim 2a we will test the
hypothesis that the neural dynamics during sustained periods of movement are largely unchanging in
both areas. In subaim 2b we hypothesize that, during sequential movements, M1 codes only the
ongoing movement whereas PPC codes both the current and subsequent movements. Finally, in subaim
2c we will examine the coding of movement speed, with the hypothesis that there are separate
subspaces in both M1 and PPC for direction and speed of movement."

This is a competing renewal application for a T35 short term medical student summer training program in
endocrine research that has been funded by NIDDK for 15 years. The 2 Specific Aims are 1) To provide
hands-on training in basic and clinical Endocrine-related research to medical students in a structured mentored
environment; 2) To provide an interactive, educational experience that introduces medical students the
fundamental skills necessary for basic, translational, and clinical Endocrine-related research. The program has
supported the training of 6 second year medical students in endocrine research topics including diabetes – with
a particular focus on diabetic kidney disease, endocrine malignancies, pituitary regulation of peptide hormone
expression, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiovascular complications of diabetes and obesity, hormonal
regulation of metabolism, and stem cell biology. Trainees are selected from the first year class at University of
Louisville School of Medicine (SOM) applying for the summer research scholar program (SRSP). A successful
effort has been made to recruit students from underrepresented minorities and disadvantaged backgrounds.
Students review the available projects submitted by 28 faculty research mentors and enter their 1st-3rd choices,
allowing matching of trainees with mentors. In-person meetings between trainees and mentors assures the ‘fit’
in the middle of the Spring semester. During the 10 week summer training, students work with mentors on
research projects in clinical or laboratory settings, complete training in the Responsible Conduct of Research,
including managing scientific data, fabrication and falsification of data, plagiarism, publication practices and
responsible authorship, mentorship, stewardship, and conflict of interest. Trainees working with human
subjects complete human subject and IRB training. Trainees who use vertebrate animals in mentors’ labs
complete and pass IACUC training courses. All trainees attend a weekly Summer Endocrine Research
Training Class to introduce clinical/translational research in endocrinology. An essential component well-
integrated into this class by T35 faculty mentors is discussion of methods for enhancing reproducibility. The
Class culminates with each trainee presenting his/her research project to peers and mentors. Trainees also
present their research results as posters at a SOM-wide, week-long celebration of Research!Louisville.
Winners from the poster contest have the opportunity to attend the National Student Research Forum the
following Spring. Trainees may choose to continue research as part of the Distinction in Research (DIR) track
enrichment program that provides research experiences throughout the medical school curriculum, including in
the third and fourth years, toward the goal of developing clinician-researchers. Student trainees have published
in peer reviewed journals and/or presented their research in national or international forums and many have
received the DIR notation on their medical school diplomas. Trainee career outcomes are tracked to assess
the impact of this T35 program on careers as physician-scientists."

The accelerating pace of discovery in the basic biomedical, clinical and translational sciences now provides
unprecedented opportunities to transform patient care in gastrointestinal and liver diseases. Over the past 35
years, Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) has made major contributions to the training of academic
gastroenterologists and hepatologists seeking cures for digestive diseases. This application from BWH
requests support for the research training of 4 basic and clinical/translational research fellows, with BWH
providing funding for an additional training slot. Outstanding candidates with strong interests and solid
foundations in research will be recruited and trained to apply their knowledge and skills towards addressing
important unmet clinical needs in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with gastrointestinal and
hepatic diseases. Trainees will receive program support for 2 years during which they will follow a structured
and rigorous, but individualized training program. This will be a joint effort of 25 eminent and diverse
preceptors from BWH, Boston Children’s Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, the
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Broad Institute.
These preceptors constitute a network of collaborative researchers, who are international leaders in fields
directly relevant to gastroenterology and hepatology. They have been organized into 4 themed, but
interconnected research training units: cell biology, immunology and microbiology; metabolism and
bioengineering; genes, stem cells and development; and clinical and translational sciences. These training
units will provide content-specific educational programming and will increase the efficiency of administration
within the training program. Oversight will be provided by a Research Training Executive Committee including
the Program Director and 2 Associate Program Directors, who will also serve as preceptors. Additional
members will provide guidance on mentoring and on achieving and maintaining diversity within the training
program. An outstanding roster of internal and external advisory board members will evaluate the program and
provide specific recommendations that improve its quality, diversity, efficiency and value added to the research
training of our most promising gastroenterology fellows. This highly personalized training program will include:
1) individual development plans; 2) rigorous research training; 3) hands-on experience in cutting-edge
methodologies, and; 4) an integrated curriculum. Trainees will further benefit from the extensive institutional
resources and rich intellectual environment of the participating institutions. Based upon the sustained levels of
interest in our fellowship program, we anticipate a substantial pool of highly qualified candidates and will
maintain a strong focus on diversity. Through its rigorous, structured and highly personalized curriculum, this
training program affirms its commitment to training future leaders in digestive disease research who are
prepared to translate their findings towards improving patient care."
10819521,"PROJECT 1 SUMMARY
P1 is aligned with each of the Center’s 3 overarching aims: 1. Identify cognitive functional organization principles
of higher order thalamic nuclei in interacting with cortex; 2. Translate thalamic functionality from animal models
to healthy and diseased human brain; 3. Develop a biologically plausible model for human higher order thalamus.
Specifically, P1 will investigate regions of the pulvinar associated with early visual cortical areas (V1, V2, and
V4) to test specific hypotheses about cognition and circuit dynamics in higher order thalamus. This project takes
advantage of the retinotopic relationship between pulvinar and cortex to enable precise electrode placement for
studying the influence of cognitive control on circuit dynamics at a synaptic, cellular, and network level. In
alignment with Center Aim 1, results from P1 will be compared to those from P2, P3, and P4 to establish a
comprehensive and mechanistic understanding of the role of higher order thalamus in cognitive control. In
alignment with Center Aim 2, results from P1 will provide a framework for understanding the impact of disease
in (P5). In alignment with Center Aim 3, results from P1 will inform Core B as its models evolve. Core C will
provide essential analytical tools for P1 as well as ensure that data can be exchanged and compared between
projects.
 In P1/Aim 1, we will record from optogenetically identified regions of pulvinar associated with V1, V2, and
V4 in monkeys performing the APU task. We will then optogenetically silence the V1 inputs to these PUL regions
to assess their role in decision making and spatial attention. In P1/Aim 2, we will use an assay developed in our
laboratory, the “dual-neuron shock-spike assay”, to determine the spatial organization of attention effects in the
pulvinar and the influence of attention on the efficacy of pulvino-cortical communication. Lastly, in P1/Aim 3, we
will use optogenetics to inactivate V1 and V2 axons within the pulvinar to determine the influence of cognitive
factors on pulvinar regulation of cortico-cortical communication."
10819525,"PROJECT 2 SUMMARY
Project 2 (P2) will specifically contribute to Center hypothesis 1 and 3 by investigating cognitive control
functions of two higher order thalamic nuclei, the medio-dorsal pulvinar (mdPUL; a primate-specific part of the
pulvinar) and the MD along with their cortical networks. Lesion studies in humans and non-human primates
(NHP) indicate that particularly these nuclei, which are primarily interconnected with the vastly expanded
association cortices, play an important role in cognitive control functions including executive functioning,
attention, and working memory. Specifically, we will target a mdPul-fronto-parietal (frontal eye field, FEF; lateral
intraparietal area, LIP) network in the Center’s “Attention-under-perceptual-uncertainty” (APU) task and an MD-
PFC-ACC (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dlPFC; anterior cingulate cortex, ACC) network in the Center’s
“Hierarchical Decision Making” (HDM) task. The former study will permit a direct comparison of sensory-related
parts of pulvinar probed in the same task in P1 at the large-scale, in P3 at the circuit level, and in P4 at the
network level with the primate-specific mdPul. The latter study will complement the circuit level (P3) and network
level (P4) investigation of the same HDM task. The results of all three animal projects are expected to provide a
mechanistic model for the indirect neural measures obtained with neuroimaging in healthy humans in P4 and
how they may be altered in disease (P5). The outcomes will inform the computational modeling approach taken
in Core B. Given the similar data structure of the NHP projects (P1, P2), the project leaders will closely
collaborate with Core C to establish common preprocessing routines and analytical strategies, as well as probe
and develop innovative novel strategies to characterize simultaneously acquired population recordings. In P2,
we propose to perform simultaneous recordings from thalamus and interconnected cortical areas to test key
hypotheses about the role of higher order thalamus in cognition. In Aim 1, we will investigate interactions of a
mdPul-LIP-FEF network in monkeys trained on our APU task. Our hypothesis is that pulvinar computes signals
that reflect decision uncertainty to control functional connectivity across cortical areas during attentional
allocation. In Aim 2, we will target dlPFC, ACC and their projection zones in MD in monkeys trained on our HDM
task. Our hypothesis is that MD represents rule mapping uncertainty and will modulate ACC-dlPFC interactions
based on such representation. In Aim 3, we will characterize differences and commonalities in thalamic
computations and thalamocortical interactions of the circuits investigated in aims 1 and 2 to identify possible
general functional organization principles that emerge regardless of the specific thalamocortical circuit that a
nucleus is part of or the cognitive operations supported by it. Collectively, the expected outcomes for P2 will
provide essential information towards a mechanistic and biologically plausible model for human thalamus
function."
10819528,"Abstract
Higher order thalamic regions play critical roles in cognitive processing by regulating their cortical targets.
Data from both such regions, the pulvinar and mediodorsal thalamus, indicate that their engagement in
decision making increases in challenging conditions, including perceptual uncertainty. Schizophrenia is a
disorder characterized by heightened susceptibitly to uncertainty on one end and perturbed connectivity
between higher order thalamus and associative cortical targets, on another. Therefore, identifying the
mechanistic links between higher order thalamic engagement and cognitive processing is translationally-
relevant; higher order thalamic regions may be viable targets for neurostimulation in treatment-resistant
schizophrenia. This project will utilize Tupaia Bellangeri (Tree shrews) as a model organism to contribute to
the overall Aims of this Center. Tupaia is a basal primate with a brain size amenable for optical perturbations
that can be readily observed at the level of behavior, tightening the casual inferences that can be made about
brain-behavior relationships. In Aim I of this project, we will build upon our extensive preliminary data on MD
thalamic function. This will be in close collaboration with P3, which will perform analogous experiments in
macaque collectively identifying the mechanisms by which the MD regulates interactions between frontal
cortical areas in the context of hierarchical reasoning. In Aim II, we will use the visual system of Tupaia to ask
analogous questions on pulvinar regulation of dorsal versus ventral visual stream engagement in a motion
vs. color switching task; this will be coordinated closely with P1, which will target the pulvinar in the macaque.
Lastly, Aim III will leverage a pharmacological model relevant to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (chronic
methamphetamine) to examine brain-behavior relationships in the context of task performance. This will be
done in close coordination with P5, which will interrogate higher order thalamic structure in humans with
schizophrenia and healthy controls. In all Aims, there will be close collaboration with P4, Cores B and C, to
ensure that the data contributes general insights for building a biologically-plausible model of the human
thalamus. Altogether, successful completion of our Aims promises to contribute to the overall vision of this
Center in propelling the basic understanding of thalamocortical processing and cognition forward, as well as
deriving translational insights for treatment of schizophrenia."

Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) is the most common chronic respiratory disease in infants and is a
devastating condition that disrupts the developmental program of the lung secondary to preterm birth. BPD
affects neonates exposed to mechanical ventilation and, to date, there are no specific drugs available to prevent
or treat this life-threatening condition. The pathologic hallmarks of BPD are hyperoxia-induced pulmonary
inflammation, increased cell death, dysregulated angiogenic factors culminating in impaired alveolarization,
dysregulated vascularization of the lung and pulmonary hypertension. AyuVis Research, Inc, is developing a
novel class of low molecular weight natural oligosaccharide-derived small molecules which activate macrophage
to a non-inflammatory phenotype via TLR4/CD163 signaling. In both mouse and preterm lamb BPD models, the
lead candidate AVR-48 binds to both TLR4 and CD163 resulting in selective activation of the target cell to block
inflammatory mediators in lung and upregulation of endogenous vascularization pathways. The lead compound
AVR-48 enhances production of certain host anti-inflammatory molecule such as IL-10 and growth factor VEGF
with vascularization effects remaining local to lungs, improving lung vascularization/alveolization leading to
improved lung function. AVR-48 also prevents the development of BPD associated pulmonary hypertension.
Importantly, we have assessed the Maximum Tolerated Dose and determined the NOAEL dose of AVR-48 in
adult rats and Dogs and efficacy/safety doses in lamb BPD model via IV dosing, which we will use to determine
the dose ranges of our proposed clinical studies. We have demonstrated all these above-mentioned therapeutic
effects in two BPD models: intraperitoneal injection of AVR-48 prevents hyperoxia-induced BPD in a neonatal
mice pup model at 10mg/kg dose and intravenous injection in invasive mechanical ventilator induced BPD in
pre-term lambs at 3.0 mg/kg dose. In order to advance the lead candidate AVR-48, AyuVis is proposing 1) the
manufacture of GMP quality AVR-48 in sufficient quantities, stability and product packing for use in our clinical
trial, 2) design the clinical protocol and complete the crucial IND and regulatory preparation to support our clinical
planning and 3) perform a Phase 1 SAD/MAD clinical trial using healthy human volunteers.
The completion of this clinical trial will provide the essential safety and pharmacokinetic data required to continue
the product development of AVR-48. The data yielded through the completion of the aims of this project will lead
the way to the development of future clinical project, including a Phase II clinical trial aimed to assess the efficacy
and safety of AVR-48 in preterm patients at risk of developing BPD. Ultimately, our clinical pipeline will bring to
market a prophylactic treatment for BPD, where there is a vastly unmet clinical need."

Standard identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of bloodstream pathogens are
conducted using slow methods that require blood culture. Diagnostic results are available three or more days
after the diagnostic process is started. The lack of rapid diagnostic results forces physicians to treat patients with
broad-spectrum antibiotics which are not effective against a growing number of resistant organisms and can
induce the development of more antimicrobial resistance. Here, we propose the development of a rapid
diagnostic platform that, if successful, will enable effective and targeted therapy of bloodstream infection patients
within hours.
The new platform will directly analyze whole blood samples using a simple and robust single molecule detection
approach called Single MOlecule Tethering or SMOLT. The platform will be rapid (ID in one hour and AST in 4-
6 hours), easy-to-use, and cost-effective. Our preliminary results show that a SMOLT multiplex assay can detect
bacteria in blood with limits of detection (LOD) between 1-10 CFU/mL with a turn-around-time of about an hour.
The same technique can be used for AST. Preliminary results show that a brief incubation with an antibiotic
follow by SMOLT detection can be used to determine if a strain is susceptible, intermediate or resistance in high
agreement with the category assigned be a standard reference method. In aim 1, we propose the development
of a SMOLT multiplex ID assay capable of detecting and identifying the rRNA of six highly relevant pathogens
directly in whole blood. The goal of aim 2 is to develop a SMOLT phenotypic AST assay for combinations of the
six ID species and 14 relevant drugs. Our third aim is to develop a prototype instrument for the SMOLT ID and
AST assays that is easy-to-use with minimum hands-on-time. The last aim is to evaluate the ID and AST assays
using blood samples seeded with a combination of fresh and stock clinical isolates as well as type strains."
10878746,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
There exists a growing demand to share all publicly-funded research data, including magnetic resonance
images (MRI). Concurrently, it has been shown that high-resolution facial reconstructions can be generated
from MRI, and face recognition software can match these reconstructions with participant photos. Standard
MRI de-identification removes participant names from the image header, but does nothing to prevent face
recognition. Identified individual research participants would be irreversibly linked with all the collected
protected health information, such as diagnoses, biomarker results, genetic risk factors, and neuropsychiatric
testing. Although data use agreements can legally protect study administrators, these legal mechanisms do not
directly protect participants. If participants were publicly identified by a careless or malicious individual, this
event would significantly and permanently erode public trust and participation in medical research. Many large
imaging studies of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and related dementias are vulnerable to this threat.
To address this threat, we propose a novel technique that de-identifies MRI by replacing facial imagery with a
generic, average face (i.e., a digital face “transplant”). Unlike existing methods that remove or blur faces, our
approach minimizes added bias and noise in imaging biomarker measurements by producing a de-identified
MRI that resembles a natural image. This imminent privacy threat grows with burgeoning technology and with
the increased public sharing of research data. We propose to: improve our de-identification software by
collaborating with a top expert in face recognition; further reduce effects on brain measurements; large-scale
test/validate on Mayo Clinic aging studies; add capability for de-facing additional imaging modalities; test and
improve performance when applied to diverse populations; and share the software freely for research use.
Aim 1: Refine and validate an optimized face de-identification algorithm: 1A) Further improve de-
identification performance; 1B) Further reduce impacts on brain biomarker measurements; 1C) Test and
validate using images from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Research Center studies.
Aim 2: Add capability for de-identifying additional imaging sequences and modalities: 2A) Support
additional MRI sequences; 2B) Support PET images; 2C) Support CT images.
Aim 3: Investigate effects of age, race, and sex: 3A) Evaluate the effects of age, race, and sex on the
proposed de-identification method; 3B) Adapt software to ensure that the algorithm protects all participants
equally.
Aim 4: Disseminate software and educational materials: 4A) Share the software freely for research use; 4B)
Develop and disseminate materials and recommendations for research studies for protection of participant
privacy."

Ovarian cancer is a devastating gynecologic malignancy with 13,770 estimated US deaths in 2021 with a 49.1%
relative 5 year survival rate (SEER). Leveraging the considerable fraction of women with ovarian cancer who
have germline or somatic homologous recombination deficiencies (HRD), poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1
inhibitors (PARPi) have become standard of care for ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, most patients treated with
PARPi develop resistance. Interestingly, most PARPi resistant patients continue to express activated PARP-1
(the target of PARPi) in the nucleus. This finding has guided our alpha theranostic radiopharmaceutical approach
to treating PARPi-resistant ovarian cancer to deliver cytotoxic alpha particles directly to the nucleus of cancer
cells to create lethal, double stranded DNA breaks. Our platform is based on a small molecule similar to the
approved PARPi, rucapararib, labeled with 18F for PET ([18F]fluorthanatrace, [18F]FTT) and 211At for alpha
therapy ([211At]parthanatrace, [211At]PTT).
 Our overarching hypothesis is that [211At]PTT can overcome PARPi resistance with an acceptable therapeutic
ratio and that the theranostic pair of [211At]PTT and [18F]FTT will allow accurate pre-treatment dosimetry to
guide both efficacy and tolerability of therapy. Using mouse models of ovarian cancer, we plan to (1) measure the
comparative dynamic biodistribution of the proposed theranostic pair, [18F]FTT and [211At]PTT to verify
preliminary data supporting similar tumor uptake and tissue kinetics, (2) understand the dose-response
relationship in tumor and organs at risk (both those expressing considerable PARP-1 and those with off target
agent biodistribution); (3) carry out pre-clinical studies to assess toxicity and efficacy of the [211At]PTT /[18F]FTT
theranostic approach with optimized dose fractionation. Our specific aims are as follows:
 SA1—Biodistribution and Pharmacokinetics: Test the comparative biodistribution of [18F]FTT and
[211At]PTT in normal tissue and ovarian cancer.
 SA2—Dose-response relationship: Develop and validate on- and off-target normal organ dose
limits and tumor dose-response relationship utilizing [18F]FTT PET/CT to predict dosimetry
from [211At]PTT.
SA3—Pre-clinical trials: Determine the optimal dosing scheme and estimate efficacy in patient
derived ovarian cancer murine models.
Successful completion of these aims will provide data needed for a first in human clinical trial of [18F]FTT -guided
[211At]PTT therapy in women with advanced PARPi-resistant ovarian cancer and will provide insight into tumor
factors mediating effective alpha particle therapy to guide patient selection in clinical trials and clinical practice."

Bacterial infectious disease is a global threat to human health and there is an urgent need to develop new
antimicrobials that limit the impact of life-threatening pathogens. These pathogens include the major causative
agents of nosocomial infections, e.g., Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus, and a major
respiratory pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae. In this renewal application, we seek continuation of our
innovative, strongly integrated and topical research program positioned at an intersection of inorganic chemistry
and microbial physiology, designed to tackle significant gaps in our knowledge in bacterial transition metal
homeostasis (metallostasis) and hydrogen sulfide homeostasis. My group has long-standing interests in the
transcriptional repressor proteins (metallosensors) and metallochaperones that allow a bacterium to respond to
host efforts to restrict transition metal availability or induce metal toxicity. Our subsequent discovery of
transcriptional regulators that “sense” downstream more oxidized forms of hydrogen sulfide, collectively termed
reactive sulfur species (RSS), is foundational to our understanding of hydrogen sulfide signaling via protein
persulfidation (S-sulfuration). Indeed, an emerging consensus holds that the biogenesis of hydrogen sulfide and
RSS provides protection against host weapons reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species, and antibiotics,
where they function as antioxidants and signaling molecules. Future research will be carried out in four general
areas: 1) Investigating allostery in transcriptional regulation, where we extend our comprehensive physical
description of metallosensors as dynamically-anchored “allosteric inorganic switches” to RSS sensors, using
state-of-the-art methyl-specific NMR relaxation experiments and a novel mass spectrometry-based kinetic
profiling method used to elucidate the broad principles of RSS specificity in diverse structural classes of
regulators; 2) critically evaluate the RSS signaling hypothesis in A. baumannii, which posits that persulfidation is
a regulatory modification, completely unexplored in bacteria; 3) deduce the global impact of host transition metal
(zinc, iron) starvation (nutritional immunity) using complementary proteomics and metalloproteomics workflows
to define changes in the metalloproteome while identifying metallochaperone targets, in A. baumannii; and 4)
elucidate a poorly understood, infection-relevant iron-catecholate acquisition and detoxification pathway in S.
pneumoniae. Our multidisciplinary approach, which seamlessly spans biophysical, bioinorganic and analytical
chemistries to microbial physiology, will transform our understanding of foundational principles of pathogen
metallostasis and hydrogen sulfide/RSS biogenesis in an effort to discover and characterize new players and
biological processes that can be targeted by novel antibacterial strategies."

Protein homeostasis is crucial to maintain healthy cells and is predominantly controlled by the ubiquitin
proteasome system (UPS) whereby proteins are tagged with ubiquitin, via a cascade of 3 enzymes, resulting in
recognition by the proteasome and subsequent degradation. While some proteins are constitutively recognized
and degraded by this system, others are marked as substrates for the UPS by post-translational modifications
such as phosphorylation. Recently, acetylation of non-histone proteins has emerged as an important mechanism
of regulation for the ubiquitin-proteasome system, particularly at the level of E3 ligase substrate recognition.
Leveraging our expertise of the ubiquitin proteasome and protein-protein interactions we propose to elucidate
the molecular mechanisms and biological pathways resulting in acetylation driven modulation of protein
homeostasis (Project 1). Additionally, building on our previous work with proteolysis targeting chimera, we will
develop heterobifunctional approaches to modulate protein acetylation states as a novel mechanism to control
protein homeostasis for both the study of this fundamental biological regulation and as a potential therapeutic
approach (Project 2).
In Project 1, we will identify and characterize proteins with stability regulated at the level of post-translational
acetylation. Using proteomics experiments paired with RNA-Seq we will generate a database of proteins with
intracellular levels directly controlled by p300 driven acetylation, not altered at the level of transcription.
Furthermore, we will characterize the molecular recognition of acetyl degron substrates by the relevant E3
ligases using biophysical, biochemical and structural approaches, revealing unique insights into this mechanism
of protein homeostasis. In Project 2, we will develop heterobifunctional compounds which recruit an
acetyltransferase or deacetylase to a neo-substrate. Building on the concept of chemically induced post-
translational modifications, exemplified by proteolysis targeting chimera, we will identify the (de)acetylation
machinery most amenable to this approach via chemical biology approaches before designing and synthesising
compounds to edit acetylation in native systems.Together these projects provide insights into basic biological
processes regulating protein stability and a novel chemical biology approach to modify them."

The lipid composition of cell membranes controls bilayer permeability and fluidity as well as the folding and
activity of integral membrane proteins, which comprise ~30% of the human proteome. Consequently, the lipid
composition of membranes is subject to tight homeostatic control. Over the past 60 years, we have learned a
tremendous amount about membrane lipid cell biology, largely from model organisms because forward
genetics in cultured human cells remained challenging. CRISPR technology now permits a direct examination
of these cellular functions in human cells, opening up a new era of mammalian cell genetics.
Our MIRA research strategy is to apply mammalian cell genetics to long-standing questions in cell biology,
specifically focusing on the regulation of membrane lipid homeostasis. Over the next 5 years, we will use
genetics to address two challenges. For Challenge #1, we will identify new regulators of plasma membrane
lipid composition. For Challenge #2, we will discover the mechanism of lysosomal fatty acid export by
characterizing genes required for the assimilation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-derived fatty acids.
Overall, these proposed MIRA studies will make fundamental contributions to the fields of membrane biology,
intracellular lipid transport, LDL receptor function/endocytosis, the SREBP pathway, and regulation of lipid
synthesis. Given that modulation of cholesterol synthesis and LDL receptor function are primary interventions
in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, these studies may identify new therapeutic targets for the prevention
of heart disease, a leading killer of adults in the United States."
10841029,"Catalysts and Catalytic Reactions for the Synthesis of Medicinally Relevant Organic Compounds
The proposed research focuses on the discovery, development, and mechanistic evaluation of a series of
chemical reactions catalyzed by transition-metal complexes that provide new approaches to the synthesis
of organic molecules important for human health. Research on these reactions addresses several of the
major unmet needs in chemical synthesis. These unmet needs include reactions that occur at C-H bonds
with high selectivities and high tolerance for auxiliary functional groups; the creation of catalysts that induce
chemical reactions at one of many potential reaction sites in complex structures; catalytic transformations
of complex molecules to modulate the structures and properties of biologically active compounds;
assembly of aliphatic sub-structures with control of the absolute and relative configurations of stereogenic
centers to create more complex three-dimensional architectures; and greater mechanistic understanding
of catalytic methods to help select or invent catalysts and reagents that achieve these synthetic goals. This
program focuses on the development and mechanistic understanding of catalytic reactions that are some
of the most widely used reactions during drug-discovery and production, as well as reactions poised to
become the next set of such reactions and classes of catalysts that can lead to new capabilities. These
reactions include selective functionalization of C-H bonds with main group reagents to form valuable
synthetic intermediates, reactions to form alkyl C-N bonds by addition of N-H bonds across alkenes with
unprecedented efficiency, coupling processes to form carbon-heteroatom bonds with organic electrophiles
catalyzed by copper and nickel systems, and reactions catalyzed by an unusual class of hybrid structure
generated by formally exchanging the metal of natural metalloenzymes with an organometallic unit to
create artificial metalloenzymes that form products with site-selectivity and stereoselectivity that would be
difficult to achieve with natural enzymes or small-molecule catalysts. In all cases, the proposed research
includes detailed mechanistic analysis by kinetic stuides and independent synthesis of catalytic
intermediates, as well as the use of these mechanistic data to select or design next-generation systems. A
particular focus of these mechanistic studies will be placed on revealing the properties of recently
discovered catalysts for the functionalization of primary alkyl C-H bonds and recently discovered copper
and nickel intermediates in catalytic cross coupling reactions to form carbon-heteroatom bonds."
10878823,"Development of New Proteomics Technology and its Application to Study Cellular Organization
 The broad goal of our lab is to obtain a systems-level understanding of cellular organization and develop
proteomics technology that facilitates this research. Thanks to the human genome project, we have a nearly
complete parts list of all molecules making up cells, but we still very poorly understand how these molecules
come together and elegantly organize into a living system. So far, this organization has been studied mainly by
looking carefully at one protein at a time. While this approach has been tremendously successful, it cannot
address the higher levels of complexity in biological systems that arise from the interplay of a myriad of
components. Looking at one molecule at a time can severely hinder understanding biology. Instead, we
investigate the entire system all at once. Recent progress in multiplexed proteomics enables us to observe
thousands of proteins simultaneously among multiple conditions. Combined with classical biochemical
approaches, we can reveal collective behavior and emergent properties that we would not have discovered
otherwise. My lab is broadly interested in systems-level cellular organization. Towards this goal, this proposal
contains two parts.
 The first part of this proposal outlines how we intend to improve quantitative proteomics technology.
Proteomics has become very powerful. Nevertheless, severe shortcomings concerning sensitivity, data quality,
and accessibility remain. We strive to address these problems. Over the last year, we have developed a new
method for quantitative shotgun proteomics (TMTproC), producing data with unmatched sensitivity and
measurement quality while reducing cost. Next, we aim to make TMTproC compatible with entry-level mass
spectrometers, which has the potential to democratize quantitative proteomics. Furthermore, we propose to fuse
TMTproC with data-independent acquisition (DIA). We anticipate that this will fuse the benefits of both
approaches: a method delivering the exquisite measurement quality of multiplexed proteomics with the infinite
scalability of DIA.
 The second part describes how we aim to apply our technological advances toward understanding
systems-level mechanisms. First, we will integrate passive diffusion and active transport models through the
nuclear pore to predict how the entire proteome partitions between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Second, we aim
to integrate all levels of protein abundance control aspects for every gene – transcription, translation, and protein
degradation. We will focus on protein turnover, the technically most difficult to measure of these parameters.
Ultimately, we aim to determine how protein expression levels are controlled for each gene as a fertilized zygote
develops into an embryo with a fully defined body plan. These measurements will provide us with fundamental
insight into the regulation and organization of developing embryos in health and disease."

Protein secretion plays a central role in developing and maintaining multicellular organisms. Specialized cell
types in tissues secrete proteins by regulated or constitutive secretion. Regulated secretion occurs in response
to an extracellular stimulus that elicits the release of signaling molecules, while constitutive secretion facilitates
the deposition of extracellular matrix components that provide tissue integrity. Even though these processes
are highly significant for human health, features that determine whether a protein is secreted by
regulated or constrictive secretion remain unknown. A central regulator of intracellular protein distribution
is the trans-Golgi Network (TGN), which sorts and packages secretory proteins into specific vesicular carriers
targeting them to intracellular storage granules (regulated secretion) or the cell surface (constitutive secretion).
The identification of the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6P-R) that recognizes M6P tags of lysosomal led to
the idea that specific sorting receptors also sort secretory proteins. However, conserved recognition signals
or cargo receptors remain unknown. How are these molecules recognized and sorted for targeting the
correct destination?
The concept of concentrating macromolecules into biomolecular condensates by liquid-liquid phase separation
(LLPS) has revolutionized modern cell biology. Human cells use this principle to organize biochemical
processes spatially without a membrane. Our recent research raises the novel possibility that the segregation
of secretory proteins in the TGN lumen follows this concept. Our work has shown that purified chromogranins
(CGs) or Cab45 undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the milieu of TGN. Both proteins have been
suggested to co-aggregate with secreted proteins (clients) to facilitate their sorting and packaging. We show
that CG or Cab45 liquids, not solid aggregates, are essential for client sorting and packaging. Nonetheless,
the underlying mechanisms of LLPS-dependent client packaging remain elusive. Therefore, our long-term
goal is to understand the molecular basis of LLPS-dependent cargo sorting for regulated (by CGs) and
constitutive (by Cab45) secretion.
Our proposal aims at identifying the mechanisms of LLPS-dependent sorting in reconstituted systems that
recreate the milieu of the TGN lumen. We will include model membranes to examine if and how these
condensates associate with the luminal leaflet of the TGN. We will use cell culture models of regulated (P12
cells) or constitutive (skin fibroblasts) secretion to validate our in-vitro results in living cells. Our concept will
establish the molecular requirements for condensate formation, the mechanisms of client recognition and
vesicular formation in regulated and constitutive secretion. These results will provide a fundamental
understanding of an exciting new paradigm in cell biology and impact the research of pathologies
caused by defective protein secretion, such as psychiatric disorders or cancer."

 The Day Lab engineers nanoparticles (NPs) with unique physicochemical properties to transform the
treatment of various diseases and elucidates how architecture impacts function by studying nano/bio interactions
from the subcellular to whole organism level. The NPs we develop enable high precision therapy by: (1) delivering
antagonistic antibodies or nucleic acids to cells to inhibit genes that drive disease progression, (2) supplying heat
or other payloads only to diseased cells in response to activation with tissue-penetrating near-infrared light, or
(3) facilitating cell-specific cargo delivery by using cell-derived membranes as coatings that minimize immune
recognition and enable target cell binding. We are applying our technologies to manage aggressive cancers,
blood disorders, and maternal/fetal health conditions. Further, we are proving through rigorous studies that both
what is packaged in NPs and how it is packaged dictate therapeutic potency. Much of our work advancing
nanomedicine over the last five years was funded by the MIRA program. Moving forward, we will use our acquired
tools and knowledge to probe unanswered questions in nanomedicine and advance the ability of NPs to surpass
biological barriers.
 There is currently an undesired disparity between preclinical and clinical performance of nanomedicines
that is driven by biological barriers that limit NP delivery efficiency, efficacy, and safety. These include immune
barriers (protein corona formation leading to macrophage clearance), vascular barriers (limited extravasation),
and tissue barriers (poor penetration through extracellular matrix, mucus, etc. to reach desired cells in
heterogeneous populations). Over the next five years we will address these biological barriers through
mechanistic studies that incorporate and adapt NPs previously developed in our lab to enhance delivery and
efficacy. Specifically, we will investigate questions related to protein corona-mediated immune clearance, the
role of inflammation in NP extravasation, and NP interaction with reproductive tissue barriers and the vaginal
microbiome. Answering these questions will guide the development of NPs with improved clinical performance.
In addition to advancing the broader field of nanomedicine, the information gained will lead into the long-term
research of the Day Lab addressing both extracellular and intracellular barriers to nanomedicine. Overall, our
work has both basic scientific and translational significance, and our discoveries will transform the application of
nanomedicine to diverse healthcare problems by developing technologies with unmatched clinical performance."

The Evers laboratory studies the binding interactions of neurosteroids and cholesterol with integral membrane
proteins, with the aim of identifying the specific binding events underlying sterol modulation of protein function.
Our major focus is on neurosteroid (NS) modulation of -aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAA-
R). Neurosteroids are important modulators of neuronal excitability and nervous system development with
enormous therapeutic potential as anesthetics, anti-depressants and neuro-protectants. We have shown
that there are multiple, subunit-specific binding sites for neurosteroids on GABAA receptors, each of which
contributes to the functional effects of neurosteroids. In the proposed research, we will use photolabeling
techniques to define the precise sites at which the major classes of neurosteroids bind on the most abundant
forms of synaptic and extra-synaptic GABAA receptors and determine the functional significance of each
identified binding site by assessing the effect of targeted amino acid substitutions on NS modulation of GABAA-
R currents. To identify photo-labeled residues we will utilize state-of-the-art protein chemistry and expression
techniques in conjunction with cutting edge mass spectrometry (MS) methods, including middle-down and
intact protein MS. High-resolution cryogenic-electron microscopy structures will be obtained to identify the
atomic details of novel NS binding sites and to investigate binding interactions that appear to stabilize
conformations not captured in current structures. Fluorescence-based binding assays will then be used to
measure the site-specific affinity of various NS for the identified binding sites. These assays will be
adapted to stopped-flow fluorimetry to determine the state-dependence of binding and to a plate reader
format to screen for site-specific agonists and antagonists. The long term goal of our NS program is to
develop and use site-specific NS ligands to probe the role of specific NS binding sites and GABAA-R subtypes
in the behavioral effects of endogenous NS and the mechanisms of action of NS sedatives and anesthetics.
 We have also used cholesterol-analogue photolabeling to identify specific binding sites that
mediate cholesterol inhibition of the lipid scramblase, nhTMEM16, and cholesterol modulation of
mTOR1 by the lysosomal membrane protein GPR155. Both nhTMEM16 and GPR155 have two specific
cholesterol binding sites per protein monomer and we are using targeted amino acid substitution to
understand the functional role of each site. We are also developing fluorescence-based binding assays to
measure cholesterol affinity and sterol specificity for these sites. Novel cholesterol binding sites present new
targets for small molecule allosteric modulators of membrane protein function and the tools we have
developed are widely applicable to identifying binding sites on other cholesterol-modulated proteins and
screening for site-specific ligands."
10873768,"The preschool years are a critical time for shaping food preferences and eating behaviors
which, in turn, affect dietary behaviors in adults and life-long risks for obesity, diabetes,
cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions. Unfortunately, many US children,
especially low-income and ethnic minorities, have dietary patterns associated with obesity and
increased morbidity. Thus, to improve child diet quality, it is essential to develop effective
targeted interventions in settings where children (especially higher risk children) spend time.
There is a national call for dietary interventions that span multiple settings including the
childcare and home environments. In response to PAS-20-160, we build upon our efficacious
Healthy Start intervention with family childcare home (FCCH) providers (FCCP) to pilot a novel,
8-month multilevel tailored intervention to reach families through FCCH. This would be the first
study to incorporate family-based intervention components into FCCH. FCCH are a promising
intervention setting as parents trust FCCPs as extended family members and FCCP feel
comfortable talking to parents about children’s diet, but want more training to do so effectively.
The 8-month intervention will include an adapted version of the Healthy Start intervention for
English and Spanish-speaking FCCP as well as FCCP training to deliver nutrition messages to
parents using an existing childcare App, complemented with FCCH environmental cues and
tailored print and videos for parents. Specific Aims are to: SA.1. Conduct formative research
with FCCP and parents to inform refinement of the multi-level intervention. SA.2. Conduct a pilot
trial with 40 FCCP and 80 parents with 18-54-month-old children to evaluate feasibility and
acceptability of intervention and study protocols, and preliminary efficacy of the nutrition
intervention compared to an attention-matched control on: a). children’s dietary quality at FCCH
and home, b). social/physical FCCH and home food environments, c). children’s dermal
carotenoid levels and z-BMI scores. SA3. Conduct post qualitative interviews with parents,
FCCP, coaches, staff & partners to assess the intervention’s acceptability and suggestions for
improvement. In sum, feasible and effective interventions to improve young children’s diets are
urgently needed. The FCCH is a novel and untapped setting to intervene with both FCCP and
parents simultaneously to affect children’s diets in both the childcare and home settings, which
has the potential to more fully impact the child’s overall diet and weight status. This pilot
feasibility research of a novel, multi-level intervention will inform a future full-scale cluster RCT,
which will fill important research gaps and move the frontier of nutrition research forward."
10840795,"Project Summary / Abstract
Abnormal mucociliary clearance (MCC) is a critical component of cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease, and is
postulated to contribute to the high incidence of chronic pulmonary infections in this patient population; in turn
the presence of chronic infection is thought to worsen the MCC defect, creating a cycle of mucus obstruction,
infection, and inflammation that is difficult to interrupt or reverse. However, the mechanisms and interactions
responsible for this phenomenon are not well understood. New animal models, such as the CF rat, developed
at our institution, have been useful in identification of key factors that lead to chronic infection with the
pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the CF airway. This animal model develops the MCC defect
progressively, providing a model with which to study patients with early disease as well as late disease. In this
model of CF, mucus must be abnormal before exposure to Pseudomonas aeruginosa to convert the infection
to a chronic phenotype. CF rats exposed before the mucus abnormality develops are able to clear the
infection. A new rat model harboring a humanized G551D-CFTR genomic insert respond to FDA-approved
CFTR modulators that treat the fundamental defect of CF disease. Using the innovative Micro-Optical
Coherence Tomography (µOCT), a high-resolution reflectance imaging modality that can simultaneously and
non-invasively evaluate airway hydration, ciliary beating and mucus transport and viscosity in situ, we can
analyze aspects of the mucus defect in both the CF rat model before and after infection, with or without CFTR
modulators. Using these tools, this proposal will seek to investigate the mechanisms that cause patients with
CF to transition acute infections into chronic ones, with the following independent but complimentary aims:
1. Determine if Muc5b is the specific component of mucus that promotes chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa
infection.
2. Determine if inflammation is necessary and sufficient to accelerate the mucus defect, predisposing the
 airway to chronic P. aeruginosa infection.
3. Determine if new highly effective CFTR modulators promote clearance of P. aeruginosa by normalizing
 abnormal mucus in the airway.
This proposal will determine the early events that lead to infection and progression in CF pulmonary disease
and how this relates to the conversion of P. aeruginosa from intermittent to chronic in this patient population,
using a highly relevant animal model. The studies will provide new fundamental observations that will inform
our understanding of the CF respiratory pathology and help identify robust therapeutic targets suitable for
intervention."

Natural genetic variation impacts most human diseases, yet predicting how regulatory variants control gene
expression and ultimately disease phenotypes poses considerable challenges. First, the polygenic inheritance
influencing most conditions requires consideration of a vast number of genes and regulatory elements. This
task is challenged by the complexity of gene regulation, where 3D regulatory interactions can link enhancers
and genes over large genomic distances. Second, multiple interacting cell types are often dysregulated in
disease pathology. This necessitates an understanding of how the collective variants associating with a
disease affect each cell type involved in the disease process and subsequently how these dysregulated
cellular phenotypes crossregulate and drive subsequent cellular states. In this IGVF project, we will use
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a human autoimmune inflammatory disease, as a case study to develop robust
machine learning models of gene regulation to decipher the impact of genomic variation on multiple cellular
drivers of pathology—namely, inflammatory T cell and fibroblast subsets found in affected joint tissue. The
choice of RA is motivated by its public health importance, specified target tissue, access to clinical samples,
considerable knowledge of disease-associated gene loci, and our team’s complementary expertise in machine
learning, RA pathophysiology, immunology and inflammation, and single-cell functional genomics.
We will develop an advanced machine learning framework to model the effects of allelic variation on gene
regulatory networks based on the analysis of epigenomes, transcriptomes, and connectomes of mouse
activated T cells and synovial fibroblasts and extend these models to RA patient joint tissue and primary cells.
We will train allele-specific gene regulatory models (GRMs) that account for long-range regulatory interactions
by integrating single-cell transcriptome and epigenome (sc-multiome) data with bulk 3D interactome analyses.
A notable feature of our approach is that we leverage the genetic diversity of evolutionarily distant F1 hybrid
mice to provide robust training data for these models, and then apply these advances to the human context
through transfer learning. Highly parallelized Perturb-seq experiments in primary synovial fibroblasts from RA
patients with single-cell multiomic readouts will then be used to evaluate and refine regulatory models and to
train network models that connect gene expression programs to phenotype. Finally, we will combine spatial
and single-cell transcriptomics conducted on samples from RA inflamed joints to model the organization and
interactions between T cells and sedentary tissue-organizing fibroblasts within local cellular communities.
The predictive GRMs that will be generated from our study along with the experimental systems for human
disease will be readily transferrable to other polygenic disorders which must consider complex regulatory
genomic networks for various interacting cell types in affected tissues."
10845472,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Regulation of the immune system is substantially influenced by glycosylation. Cell-surface glycans tune
ligand-receptor binding and set a threshold for initiating the downstream signaling for immune cell activation.
Siglecs (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins) are a family of regulatory receptors involved in these
processes. A Siglec can bind to both cis and trans sialylated glycan ligands that are expressed on the same or
interacting cells, respectively. The binding of Siglecs with their ligands can either segregate Siglecs from
activation receptors or move them closer. The ability of inhibitory Siglecs to modulate activation receptors is
regulated by spatial proximity: recruiting Siglecs to the immune synapse in the proximity of activation receptors
would trigger inhibitory signaling to suppress immune-system activation, whereas moving Siglecs away from
activation receptors would enable optimal signaling through activation receptors.
 For the above reasons, recently, Siglecs have been described as glyco-immune checkpoints. Through
their interaction with sialylated glycans aberrantly expressed on tumor cells, innate immune cell-associated
Siglecs trigger signaling cascades to inhibit immune-system activation. Likewise, Siglecs upregulated on tumor
cells interact with yet-to-be identified T-cell membrane glycoproteins to suppress T cell anti-tumor functions.
On the positive side, however, inhibitory signaling through Siglecs curbs inflammation during cell death
induced by viral infection. Despite these intriguing observations, the mechanisms underlying the above
processes are just starting to be elucidated.
 The overarching goal of this project is to use a combination of chemoenzymatic, biochemical and
genetic tools to explore Siglec-glycan ligand interactions and their therapeutic implication. In Aim 1, we will
design Siglec-based chimeric switch receptors and convert inhibitory Siglecs into activation receptors. In Aim
2, we will use a cell-based glycan array platform to screen for high-affinity and specific ligands of Siglecs. Once
identified, we will explore their utilities to suppress or harness the inhibitory Siglec signaling for therapeutic
applications. Finally, we will use our chemoenzymatic tools to investigate how the Siglec-cis ligand interaction
is involved in mediating the Siglec–trans ligand interaction and accordingly immune cell activation (Aim 3)."

Aged craniofacial skeleton significantly impairs the repair and regeneration of trauma-induced bony defects.
Advanced age is a critical risk factor for many chronic and debilitating skeletal diseases including osteoporosis
and periodontitis. Periodontitis is the inflammatory destruction of alveolar bone and periodontal connective tissue,
resulting in the loss of tooth support. The disease susceptibility and severity increase dramatically with age,
leading to a significant public health concern in the aging society. However, the mechanisms that drive
craniofacial skeletal aging and age-related exacerbation of periodontitis remain largely unknown.
 Cellular senescence, the halting of proliferation for aged and damaged cells, play an important role in age-
related chronic diseases including diabetes, osteoporosis and periodontitis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)
possess self-renewal ability and multiple lineage potentials. Exhaustion of the MSC pool through senescence
represents one of the hall marks for skeletal aging. Senescent MSCs lose potential for proliferation, self-renewal
and osteogenic differentiation, contributing to the impaired bone mass and delayed repair in long-bone. MSC
senescence is also associated with age-induced acculumation of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and
DNA damage. The stress-induced senescence could alter MSC-mediated immunomodulation through
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The direct evidence on the molecular link between MSC
senescence and age-related craniofacial bone loss is lacking. Notably, alveolar bone marrow derived MSCs
(aBMSCs), compared to long-bone MSCs, are more suitable for craniofacial repair, but exhibit niche-specific
behaviors and responses to environmental stimuli.
 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivators 1α (PGC-1α) is a transcriptional coactivator with
essential roles in mitochondrial biogenesis and regulation of oxidative stress in various mitochondria-rich tissues.
Recently, we found that PGC-1α directly regulates cell fate decisions of MSCs to protect against skeletal aging
and osteoporosis. PGC-1α depletion also impaired ROS defense in MSCs, resulting in increased oxidative stress.
However, the role of PGC-1α in MSC senescence and craniofacial skeletal tissue is unknown. Based on our
preliminary experiments, MSC-specific depletion of PGC-1α significantly exacerbated age-induced trabecular
bone loss in the mandible. Global depletion of PGC-1α exacerbated periodontal inflammation and bone loss in
murine periodontitis models. Intriguingly, in vitro assays revealed that lack of PGC-1α promoted replicative
senescence of aBMSCs. Thus, we hypothesize that PGC-1α modulates aBMSC senescence via regulation of
oxidative stress to impact age-related craniofacial and periodontal bone loss. To test our hypothesis, we propose
the following aims:1) To determine if PGC-1α regulates senescence of aBMSCs and craniofacial skeletal aging;
2) To determine if PGC-1α regulates cellular senescence to influence age-exacerbated periodontal bone loss;
3) To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of how PGC-1α modulates aBMSC senescence."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Advances in lung cancer treatment
have substantially improved survival. However, the benefit has not reached all racial/ethnic groups of patients
equally. Compared with non-Hispanic European Americans (EA), non-Hispanic African Americans (AA) are
disproportionately affected by lung cancer with higher incidence and inferior survival. Their poorer outcomes
are largely driven by more advanced stages at diagnosis and underutilization of stage-appropriate treatment.
Importantly, AA and EA patients with lung cancer can achieve comparable outcomes under similar treatment
modalities. This strongly suggests that barriers to cancer care are central to outcome disparities, and strategies
targeting specific barriers will be critical to reduce long-standing disparities. However, studies addressing the
underlying mechanisms of lung cancer treatment disparities have focused on non-modifiable and much less
modifiable factors. There is an urgent need to elucidate modifiable factors influencing lung cancer treatment in
AA patients. As Penchansky proposed, healthcare access consists of five distinct dimensions, including
affordability, accommodation, acceptability, availability, and accessibility. However, most of previous studies
assessed access to lung cancer care based on insurance coverage and availability of providers, and other
dimensions of access remain critically understudied. We found that insurance coverage and availability of
cancer care collectively explained <50% of the excess risk of underutilization of guideline-concordant treatment
in AA vs EA lung cancer patients. Thus, we hypothesize that excess risks of underutilization of guideline-
concordant lung cancer care and mortality in AA vs EA patients are attributable to access barriers AA patients
disproportionately experience. To test this novel hypothesis, we will develop an integrated database with AA
and EA patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer, primarily including data from the longitudinal
SEER-Medicare database, national annual surveys of population-based samples of Medicare enrollees, a
nationwide database of providers, and neighborhood contextual measures. Using advanced spatial statistical
modeling to account for clustering within providers and neighborhoods, we will simultaneously assess five
access dimensions in association with lung cancer care and outcomes (Aim 1), examine racial differences in
access dimensions overall and by indicators of social disadvantage (Aim 2), and further quantify the
independent and collective contributions of access dimensions to racial disparities in lung cancer care and
outcomes (Aim 3). This will be the first population-based study to comprehensively assess the impacts of all
five access dimensions on lung cancer treatment and their contributions to lung cancer disparities. The results
will provide novel insights into which specific components of access are most important and potentially
modifiable in explaining lung cancer disparities, as well as where in the lung cancer care continuum they may
be most amenable to intervention to improve lung cancer care for AAs and reduce disparities."

10841526,"ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death in the United States (US). Data from the famous
Bogalusa Heart Study have demonstrated the pathogenesis of CVD can start in young children, with early
manifestation directly associated with obesity. Inter-related with obesity, is poor diet quality, and poor diet
quality has been identified as a leading cause of CVD. The long-term goal of this work is to identify strategies
that can be easily implemented by families for the primary prevention of CVD in children. The home feeding
environment, where parents serve as the gatekeepers of the foods available to children has been identified as
a key influence on eating behavior. Within the home feeding environment observational work has
demonstrated more frequent family meals is associated with increased dietary quality, greater consumption of
fruits and vegetables, decreased risk for overweight and obesity, and positive psychosocial outcomes. Family
meals may serve as a vehicle to promote the prevention of obesity and promote CVD health in young children,
but the rigor of prior research has not sufficiently tested family meal frequency as an intervention target. The
objective of the proposed randomized controlled trial is to examine the efficacy of family meal frequency as an
intervention target in addressing the primary prevention of CVD. Ninety children (6-12 years-old) and their
parent will be randomized to one of two interventions: (1) increasing family meal frequency, or (2) increasing
fruit and vegetable intake. Both intervention arms will receive a prevention-focused family-based
multicomponent lifestyle modification program, the gold standard in behavioral-based intervention research.
CVD risk factors of interest include diet quality (Aim 1), zBMI (Aim 2) and cardiovascular health as assessed by
blood pressure, fasting blood insulin, blood lipids, vascular function (Aim 3). Given, the family-based nature of
the study the moderation of parent change over time will be examined as an exploratory aim. The
comprehensive evaluation of CVD risk factors will be used to elucidate the relationship with family meal
frequency, a proposed vehicle within the home feeding environment for the primary prevention of CVD in
children."
10841528,"Obesity is an overwhelming epidemic and healthcare burden. The cardiovascular risk associated with obesity is
well-documented, yet specific pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood. The broad, long term
objective of this application is to define mechanisms driving obesity-induced cardiovascular dysfunction. Obesity
causes endothelial dysfunction in visceral adipose arteries (VAA) whereas subcutaneous adipose arteries (SAA)
remain functional. This dichotomy in vascular function presents a unique opportunity to identify novel, vascular
bed-specific targets in combatting cardiovascular disease in obesity.
A hallmark of endothelial dysfunction is reduced dilations to increased blood flow. We recently identified flow-
activated Kir2.1 channels as critical regulators of flow-induced vasodilation. Furthermore, our preliminary
evidence reveals that reduced dilations to flow in VAA of obese mice and humans is through inhibition of
endothelial Kir2.1, whereas SAA Kir2.1 function is intact. This implicates Kir2.1 as a novel, vascular bed-specific
target. The goal of the present study is to determine the mechanisms of obesity-induced endothelial dysfunction
that result in the loss of Kir function specifically in VAA. We show that Kir2.1 inhibition is dependent on the
presence of CD36, a scavenger receptor that is upregulated in obesity. CD36 contributes to the cellular uptake
of fatty acids, derivatives of which are well-known to inhibit Kir2.1. We will determine the role of CD36 in inhibiting
Kir2.1 in VAA of obese mice and humans. Our hypothesis is that elevated CD36 results in increased fatty acid
uptake into endothelial cells which leads to the inhibition of Kir2.1 and endothelial dysfunction. We propose that
the underlying impairment of VAA lies in the obesity-induced increase in the expression and function of CD36 in
mice and humans and results in Kir2.1 inhibition in VAA, effects that do not occur in SAA with obesity.
The proposed studies, as part of the NIH COBRE Phase 2, will provide the foundation for the applicant's
procurement of an NIH R01. The major project milestone is to produce adequate preliminary data by the
completion of this project to support a competetive R01 proposal. The main career goal of the applicant is to
establish a successful, externally funded research program using gold standard approaches to identify new
targets in cardiovascular disease. The University of Delaware provides a resource rich environment befitting of

10867494,"PROJECT SUMMARY: ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Center for Methodologies for Adapting and Personalizing Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Services
for SUD and HIV (MAPS Center) will develop, translate, and disseminate novel experimental and data analytic
methods to optimize adaptive interventions in substance use disorders (SUD) and HIV services. The overall
purpose of the Administrative Core is to oversee all activities of the MAPS Center and ensure the Center as a
whole meets the Center-wide overall specific aims. This Core will maintain the MAPS Center's administrative
infrastructure to keep the Center running smoothly; facilitate communication and promote synergy among all
MAPS Center investigators, staff, and sites; lift much of the administrative and regulatory burden from
investigators; support and facilitate the scientific mission of the Center; and obtain input from well-qualified
experts on the Center's efforts and activities. The Administrative Core will organize and coordinate all
research, dissemination, and training activities via three Specific Aims: (Aim 1) To promote productive
communication and synergistic collaboration among MAPS Center investigators and between MAPS Center
investigators and other SUD/HIV scientists working in prevention, treatment, and recovery services — this
includes facilitating innovative center-to-center collaborative partnerships with four well-established, NIH-
funded groups that have distinguished records of productivity in behavioral SUD/HIV research; (Aim 2) To
enhance the productivity of MAPS Center investigators by facilitating the organization, monitoring, tracking,
and reporting of financial and regulatory compliance activities; and (Aim 3) To ensure the MAPS Center
becomes a national resource for innovative and high-impact experimental and data analysis methods for
adaptive interventions in SUD/HIV prevention, treatment, and recovery services. This Core will work in concert
with the Dissemination and Training Core to implement the MAPS Center's multifaceted dissemination strategy
and to ensure that it is effective in its efforts to foster the next generation of SUD/HIV scientists and
methodologists equipped to optimize adaptive SUD/HIV services. This Core also will convene meetings of a
distinguished external advisory committee to guide the MAPS Center's scientific mission and activities and will
coordinate the MAPS Center efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. The Administrative Core will
ensure the MAPS Center operates efficiently, maximizes its productivity, brings new scholars and ideas to the
Center and to the field, and fosters continuing methodological improvements to adaptive interventions focused
on SUD/HIV prevention, treatment, and recovery services."
10867498,"PROJECT SUMMARY: DISSEMINATION AND TRAINING CORE
The experimental design and data analytic methods to optimize adaptive interventions that will be developed in
the Center for Methodologies for Adapting and Personalizing Prevention, Treatment, and Recovery Services
for SUD and HIV (MAPS Center) are highly novel. These methods will reach their true potential and impact
only if they are disseminated in ways that ignite sustainable, long-term interest in their adoption by scientists
focused on substance use disorders (SUD) and HIV. This requires dissemination and training initiatives that
are timely, effective, and efficient so that the methods can be adopted rapidly. Critically, it also requires
growing and nurturing an interdisciplinary, scientific community that investigators can draw upon for guidance
and collaboration as they leverage new methodologies for optimizing adaptive services for SUD and HIV. The
Dissemination and Training Core (DTC) will support the MAPS Center in four critical domains: dissemination of
the Center's novel methods to SUD/HIV scientists; creation and dissemination of software via a new, online
code repository; administration of a pilot grant program to engage methodologists and SUD/HIV scientists; and
mentorship of scientists at all career stages and across the full spectrum of interest and expertise in
quantitative methods, to build capacity and community. A multifaceted plan targeting a variety of audiences
and including a diverse set of resources will be used to address four Specific Aims: (Aim 1) To disseminate the
methodological innovations developed in the Center to SUD/HIV scientists to facilitate rapid adoption; (Aim 2)
To support software development critical to the success of Center research and build a new, online repository
of software and related resources to facilitate the optimization of adaptive interventions by SUD/HIV scientists;
(Aim 3) To cultivate new, innovative, collaborative projects via a pilot grant program; and (Aim 4) To foster the
next generation of SUD/HIV scientists and methodologists equipped to optimize adaptive interventions.
Methods developed in a vacuum do not further SUD/HIV intervention science. By empowering SUD/HIV
scientists to adopt the MAPS Center's innovative methods and by building the scientific community needed for
sustainable adoption, the DTC will magnify the impact of the MAPS Center, expanding the development of
high-impact, adaptive interventions to combat SUD and HIV."

Disability after traumatic brain injury (TBI) significantly affects U.S. Hispanic children. Compared to non-
Hispanic children, they have lower health related quality of life, self-care, and communication skills 3 years
after injury; even though differences are not present at hospital discharge. Long-term rehabilitation improves
outcomes, but timely initiation is key since most functional gains happen 3 to 6 months after TBI. Parents play
a significant role in their child’s recovery. However, Hispanic parents face substantial barriers that can result in
delayed treatment initiation and suboptimal outcomes. We developed and pilot tested the 1st theory-based
intervention for Hispanic children and their parents consisting of Brain Injury Education and outpatient
Navigation (1st BIEN). Based on Social Cognitive theory, 1st BIEN integrates in-person education enriched by
video content delivered through mobile phone devices, with outpatient navigation during transitions from
inpatient to outpatient care and during school return. The 1st BIEN pilot, established feasibility and acceptability
for our program and 86% attendance to initial follow-up care. We propose a multicenter randomized controlled
trial to test the efficacy of 1st BIEN to maintain long-term adherence to rehabilitation and determine its effect on
children’s functional outcomes. We will enroll 150 parent-child dyads; children (6-17 years), with moderate to
severe TBI and their parents, from 5 centers in 4 states with Hispanic population predominantly from Mexico
and Central America. A higher risk group, whose educational attainment, income and English proficiency are
lower compared to other Hispanic groups in the U.S. Parents randomized to the intervention will receive (1)
One in-person education session, using the culturally, linguistically and literacy relevant 1st BIEN booklet, plus
bi-weekly video reviews individually tailored to the child’s TBI and therapies; and, (2) three months of bilingual
outpatient navigation, modeling and coaching problem solving skills. Attention control parents will receive one
in person-education session using the 1st BIEN booklet, monthly non-TBI (Well-child) texts and usual
institutional follow up care. The primary outcome is treatment adherence at 6 months post-discharge measured
by percentage of follow-up appointments attended during the prescribed time at centralized acute facilities,
community care providers and individual therapies. Secondary outcomes are functional status of the child
using PROMIS parental report measures; and, parental health literacy, self-efficacy and mental health
measured at 3, 6, and 12 months after discharge. Children’s academic performance will also be assessed
using school records. Exploratory analyses will test possible moderators such as pre-injury parental
acculturation; and mediators, such as post intervention parental TBI-knowledge, self-efficacy, anxiety and
depression. Our study evaluates a novel, flexible and scalable approach using mobile phone devices to aid
transitions of care, increase treatment adherence and improve TBI outcomes. It addresses the needs of an
understudied population and can serve as a model for TBI family centered interventions for at risk groups."

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a highly effective treatment, but serious virus
infections occur in 82% of children undergoing HSCT at our institution and others. Current anti-
viral drugs have inadequate response rates, prolong hospitalizations, and are frequently
associated with organ toxicity. An alternative cellular therapy approach uses engineered viral
specific T-lymphocytes (VSTs) manufactured from blood donated by a patient’s stem cell donor.
VST therapy is highly effective when cells are infused in response to viremia, with response rates
of over 80%. We seek to make a critical advance in this technology by testing whether
scheduled administration of bone marrow donor derived VSTs 21 days after HSCT will be safe
and at least as effective as our current pre-emptive treatment approach of only administering
VSTs once viral reactivation or infection has occurred. We propose two specific aims.
Specific Aim 1: Randomized comparison of donor-derived scheduled vs treatment VSTs in
HSCT recipients to prevent viral infections.
Hypothesis: Recipients of scheduled VSTs given 21 days after stem cell infusion will have a
significantly lower frequency of viremia and invasive viral infections 100 days after HSCT than
patients randomized to treatment use of VST’s.
Specific Aim 2: Identify product characteristics that predict response to therapy and
compare responses in those with and without exposure to viral ligand.
Hypothesis: Specific product characteristics can be established that will identify VST products
likely to be clinically effective, and VSTs will persist in scheduled VST recipients without
stimulation from viral ligand.
Aim 2a: We will study the T cell response to adenovirus, EBV, CMV or BK virus, and product
persistence by ELISpot testing, TCR clonogram and VST persistence using TCR sequencing to
define more and less effective VST products, and to determine if VSTs expand and persist if they
are infused on a schedule into a person with no active viral replication to provide ligand.
Aim 2b: We will systematically assess HLA restriction of presentation of viral antigens, using
peptide mapping and single antigen cell lines (SALs). These data are vital for future “third party”
use of VSTs in persons without donor derived product.
This clinical trial may change the paradigm of treatment for viral infections if we are able to show
that prophylactic VST infusion prevents infections."
10836435,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neuropsychiatric disorders often affect our most distinguishing cognitive and social capabilities, which are
thought to have developed as a result of the expansion of the human neocortex. The unique mechanisms
orchestrating cortical neurogenesis and differentiation in the developing human neocortex forming the basis of
this expansion are beginning to be described. However, although genetic variation in non-coding gene-regulatory
regions, rather than in protein coding genes, drives these evolutionary changes, the cis gene regulatory elements
(GREs), including promoters and enhancers, and the transcription factors (TFs) governing cortical neurogenesis
remain to be characterized. To begin to investigate this understudied mechanism, we and others have leveraged
next generation sequencing approaches to profile chromatin accessibility and interaction in parallel with gene
expression to create GRE maps of varying levels of spatiotemporal specificity. We previously identified
thousands of developmentally dynamic GREs and their putative gene targets by contrasting GRE activity in
progenitor versus neuron-enriched laminae of mid-gestation human neocortex, and functionally validated the
role of select GREs in cortical neurogenesis using primary human neural progenitor cells. Further, we found that
human-gained enhancers (HGEs), a subset of GREs more active in the human than the macaque or mouse
neocortex, regulate genes enriched in outer radial glia (oRG), a neural progenitor with prominent roles in cortical
gyrification. This work supports the hypothesis that human developmentally dynamic GREs and HGEs direct
gene expression programs controlling the proliferation and differentiation of progenitor pools key to cortical
expansion. In this proposal, we seek to test this hypothesis and move from a tissue- and gene-level resolution
atlas to a cellular- and gene isoform-level resolution atlas. We will perform single nucleus ATAC-seq to identify
cell-specific GREs and leverage a novel single-cell isoform sequencing (scIso-seq) technology to investigate a
previously understudied mechanism of gene regulation – alternative promoter usage. This new atlas will inform
our work to functionally define the GREs impacting cortical neurogenesis at scale using CRISPR interference
(CRISPRi) libraries containing capture tags enabling simultaneous reading of transcriptome and sgRNA at the
single-cell level. Finally, we will define and characterize the TFs directing the balance of proliferation versus
differentiation of progenitors. These results will enable us identify the cellular basis of genomic variation causing
risk for neuropsychiatric disease, and influencing cognition and brain structure. Together this work will create a
robust single cell-resolution functional annotation of non-coding GREs and TFs acting in developing human
neocortex and elucidate evolutionary mechanisms driving cortical expansion. Broadly, this work will provide a
blueprint for scalable approaches to study non-coding genetic variation and cellular diversity."

About 15% of American couples experience infertility (time-to-pregnancy >12 months) and more than 20% of
couples experience spontaneous abortion (SAB, pregnancy loss <20 weeks' gestation). The prevalence of
impaired fecundity has increased over the last decade and studies indicate that sperm counts have been
declining over the last four decades. Male factor contributes to 50% of infertility, yet epidemiologic research on
predictors of male infertility is scarce and male participation in reproductive health studies has been low. Even
less research has explored paternal influences of perinatal and pediatric health outcomes. With funding from the
NICHD, we launched Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO) in June 2013 to assess the feasibility of conducting a
web-based preconception cohort study in North America to evaluate dietary, lifestyle, and medical determinants
of fecundity. Since June 2013, we have recruited more than 13,000 females and 3,000 of their male partners
from the United States and Canada. In this cohort, we have shown that male exposures, such as male sleep and
sugar-sweetened beverage intake, are strong determinants of fertility. In our NICHD-supported feasibility grant
(R21-HD094322), we demonstrated that at-home semen testing is feasible, with 400 men providing at least one
semen sample during a 3-year period. Preconception enrollment of men from the general population presents a
unique opportunity to examine how male factors influence semen quality, and the extent to which semen quality
and selected male factors predict reproductive and perinatal outcomes. We now propose to recruit an additional
2,000 men—including 800 in the semen testing substudy—to assess a broader set of aims: 1) to evaluate the
association of selected behavioral factors with poor semen quality, focusing on common but understudied factors
for which studies are limited or inconclusive (e.g. poor or inadequate sleep, bicycling, marijuana use, e-cigarette
use/vaping, and intake of sugar-sweetened, caffeinated, and alcoholic beverages); 2) to assess the extent to
which poor semen quality predicts subfertility, SAB, and adverse perinatal outcomes (shorter gestational length
and lower infant birthweight); and 3) to evaluate male factors in relation to risk of SAB and adverse perinatal
outcomes, and the extent to which these associations are mediated by semen quality. Importantly, we will assess
exposures jointly with female factors to better investigate causal pathways. Increased granularity of sleep and
activity exposures will be collected through a pilot aim to examine the feasibility of disseminating FitBit actigraphs
to a subset of 100 participants. We have already shown that appreciable numbers of men are willing to enroll in
our preconception cohort study, that men are willing to perform at-home semen testing, and that the semen data
are within the range expected for the general population. The use of an innovative and cost-effective semen
testing method, the prospective study design, the established infrastructure of PRESTO, and the comprehensive
collection of risk factor data in both male and female partners are added strengths. Results from the proposed
study will have important public health and clinical implications for male reproductive health."
10823291,"With continually improving reperfusion strategies, the overall mortality of AMI has been significantly reduced in
non-diabetic patients. However, both the prevalence and severity of ischemic heart failure (IHF) continually
escalate in patients with type 2 diabetes. Identifying risk factors, pathological mechanisms, and effective
interventions blocking diabetic exacerbation of IHF are urgently needed. Endothelial injury and resultant coronary
microvascular dysfunction (CMD) are the hallmarks of diabetic cardiovascular complications, hindering adequate
reperfusion despite successful recanalization. Clarifying mechanisms responsible for diabetic CMD and
identifying effective interventions improving coronary circulation are essential in reducing diabetic IHF
exacerbation. Research in the past decade has increased understanding of the roles adipocytes (ADp) play in
health and disease. Functional ADp are critical in maintaining systemic metabolic hemostasis, whereas ADp
dysfunction is one of the most recognized pathogenic factors leading to type 2 diabetes. A complete
understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediating the communication between adipose tissue and heart
will undoubtedly help the development of effective therapies against diabetic cardiovascular death. Extracellular
vesicles, particularly exosomes (Exo), are increasingly recognized as systemic messengers mediating inter-
cellular/inter-organ communication. Evidence from our recently published work and additional preliminary data
strongly suggest that GRK5-induced coronary microcirculatory endothelial cells (CMEC) adiponectin receptor 1
(AdipoR1) phosphorylation is responsible for attenuated ADp-derived Exo (ADp-Exo) protective signaling and
increased cytotoxic ADp-Exo uptake in diabetic CMEC, contributing to diabetic exacerbation of CMD and IHF.
Targeting the GRK5-AdipoR1 system may be a novel therapeutic intervention against diabetic CMD, ultimately
protecting the heart against IHF. This novel hypothesis will be rigorously investigated in 3 specific aims. Utilizing
genetic gain- and loss-of-function approaches, Specific Aim 1 will test a hypothesis that diabetes-induced CMEC
AdipoR1 phosphorylation blocks ADp-Exo mediated vasculoprotection, contributing to diabetic CMD and IHF
exacerbation. Specific Aim 2 will test a novel hypothesis that diabetic AdipoR1 phosphorylation and resultant
endocytosis promotes CMEC uptake of cytotoxic ADp-Exo via adiponectin (on ADp-Exo surface) interaction with
AdipoR1 (expressed in CMEC). Specific Aim 3 will determine whether 1) EC AdipoR1 phosphorylation mediates
diabetic ADp-Exo induced CMD and IHF, and 2) blocking EC AdipoR1 phosphorylation is effective in protecting
diabetes-exacerbated CMD and IHF. Successful completion of these studies will reveal a novel molecular
mechanism responsible for the diabetic exacerbation of cardiovascular injury, and potentially identify novel
therapy against CMD and post-MI remodeling in diabetic patients. Moreover, successful completion of the
proposed studies may have broader implications in the development of other diseases involving Exo, as our
work will help to fill a knowledge gap concerning cell/tissue-selective recognition of circulating Exo."
10795852,"Despite recent advances in neuroimaging, approximately 2/3 of intractable epilepsy patients that undergo
surgical evaluation continue to require intracranial EEG (IEEG), arguably the most invasive diagnostic test in
medicine. We currently lack methods to quantitatively map noninvasive imaging measures of structure and
function to IEEG. Specifically, there is a critical need to validate whole-brain noninvasive neuroimaging network-
based biomarkers to guide precise placement of electrodes and translate noninvasive network neuroimaging to
change the paradigms of clinical care. The long-term goal of this proposal is to predict IEEG functional dynamics
and surgical outcomes using noninvasive MRI-based measures of structure and function. Our overall objective,
which is the next step toward attaining our long-term goal, is to develop open-source noninvasive imaging tools
that map epileptic networks by integrating MRI and IEEG data. Our central hypothesis is that noninvasive
measures of structure and function relate to and can predict the intricate functional dynamics captured on IEEG.
The central hypothesis will be tested in patients undergoing IEEG targeting the temporal lobe network by
pursuing three specific aims: 1) To map the patient specific structural connectome to IEEG seizure onset and
propagation, 2) To correlate seizure onset and propagation on IEEG with network measures derived from resting
state functional MRI (rsfMRI), and 3) To integrate the structural (Aim 1) and functional (Aim 2) connectome with
standard qualitative clinical data to predict IEEG network dynamics and surgical outcomes. Under the first aim
patients will undergo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) prior to stereotactic IEEG, an IEEG method that inherently
samples long range networks. The functional IEEG network will be mapped to DTI thus defining how seizures
are constrained by the underlying structural connectome as they propagate. Under the second aim patients with
temporal lobe epilepsy will undergo rsfMRI on 7T MRI prior to stereotactic IEEG. Functional network measures
from rsfMRI and IEEG will be coregistered and rsfMRI will be used to predict functional EEG ictal and interictal
networks. In the third aim two models predicting IEEG network dynamics and epilepsy surgical outcomes will be
created building off of methods developed in Aims 1 and 2. The proposed research is innovative because it
represents a substantive departure from the status quo by directly connecting noninvasive multimodal imaging
with measures of functional network dynamics in IEEG. The proposed research is significant because it is
expected that successful completion of these aims will yield personalized strategies for IEEG targeting based on
noninvasive neuroimaging."

years, our training program, called the Clinical Services Research Training Program (CSRTP), has launched
the careers of clinical services investigators, many of whom are now leaders in the field, by providing high
quality education and support to postdoctoral scholars from a variety of disciplines (including psychology,
social work, epidemiology, sociology, medicine, health economics, and nursing) who plan to pursue careers in
mental health services research. The graduates of the CSRTP have been extremely successful: eighty-five
percent (85%) obtained academic or research positions; of those, 77% received research support from
extramural, primarily federal, research funds. Over half (63%) of the graduates are women and a third are
racial/ethnic minorities. During the last ten years, 26% of the fellows appointed classify themselves as
members of under-represented minorities. Of the women who have graduated from CSRTP, 73% received
extramural funding for their research; 88% of the racial/ethnic minority graduates obtained extramural research
grant support. CSRTP graduates contributed substantively to the extant literature, producing over 550 peer-
reviewed publications to date. Given the success of our program, we seek five additional years to continue
providing high quality training to four postdoctoral fellows a year (duration of program tenure is planned for two
years each) who promise to be outstanding leaders in the next generation of clinical services researchers. Our
training goals are (1) to help postdoctoral fellows acquire sufficient methodological knowledge and research
skills to conduct high quality clinical services and interventions research; (2) through study and experiential
learning, to help postdoctoral fellows acquire knowledge about the most important pressing and contemporary
issues in clinical services research; (3) to assist postdoctoral fellows to attain professional skills essential to
career advancement in academic and research settings; and (4) to help postdoctoral fellows develop a national

10814188,"Project Summary/Abstract
Polygenic risk scores (PRS), that aggregate risk across common variants in the genome, have emerged as a
powerful tool towards implementing genomic medicine. Unfortunately, the vast majority of genomic data from
which current PRS are estimated is coming from European ancestry individuals thus prohibiting the
implementation of PRS for non-European individuals. To address this gap, multiple large-scale genomic
studies are currently performed in non-European individuals. Of particular interest are individuals with recent
ancestry from multiple continental sources such as African Americans and/or Hispanic Americans whose
genomes are a mosaic of segments of various ancestries. Such diversity in genetic ancestry raises unique
challenges in the equitable PRS development as the accuracy and bias of existing PRS varies across genomic
ancestries. Unlike existing paradigm that largely views genetic ancestry as a confounder in PRS studies, we
aim to fully integrate population genetics of the admixture process to yield admixture-PRS that provide
equitable accuracies for all individuals irrespective of genetic ancestries. We will integrate data of over 230,000
admixed individuals across five diverse medical systems including UCLA, Mt Sinai, Colorado to develop,
calibrate and benchmark PRS for admixed individuals."
10886145,"7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
People who inject drugs (PWID) are at high risk for HIV infection and experience worse treatment outcomes
than other key populations, particularly in low to middle income countries (LMIC). Opioid use is common in
India and new injection drug epidemics have emerged in the North and Central regions of the country in the
last 5-10 years. In these regions, we have documented high rates of needle sharing, high HIV prevalence and
incidence, and low access to HIV testing and treatment. Our team demonstrated the potential of respondent-
driven sampling (RDS) to leverage social networks and identify unaware and out-of-care HIV-positive PWID. In
response to RFA-DA-18-017, we propose to build on our experience with RDS as the foundation of
“seek and test”, by rigorously assessing three scalable strategies aimed at improving the “treat and
retain” steps of the HIV care continuum among PWID in a LMIC setting. Aim 1 is to conduct a factorial
randomized controlled trial to evaluate the individual and combined effects of a policy intervention (same-day
ART), a structural intervention (community-based care) and an individual-level intervention (psychosocial/
navigation) to improve treatment outcomes among HIV-positive PWID. A factorial design can assess both the
main effects of multiple interventions and interactions between the interventions, offering the potential for trial
efficiency (effectively getting 3 trials for the price of one) and novel insights on how interventions with different
mechanisms may influence the effectiveness of one another. We will test 3 hypotheses: Hypothesis 1A -
Same-day ART initiation will increase 12-month survival with viral suppression among HIV-positive PWID,
compared with standard ART initiation. Same-day ART has been found effective in Africa, but has never been
evaluated in PWID. Hypothesis 1B - Community-based care will increase 12-month survival with viral
suppression among HIV-positive PWID, compared with government-based care. In prior work, we found that
PWID-centric integrated care centers (ICCs) were highly effective at engaging the population, providing opioid
treatment and increasing HIV testing uptake. Here we propose to scale-up the ICC model to provide
community-based HIV care in an accessible and non-discriminatory setting. Hypothesis 1C - A
psychosocial/navigation intervention (enhanced support) will increase 12-month survival with viral suppression
among HIV-positive PWID, compared with standard support. Patient navigators will provide PWID-focused
motivational interviewing, skills building, and field-based systems navigation and retention. We propose to
adapt and build upon evidence-based interventions for PWID. Durability of intervention effects will be assessed
at 18 months. Aim 2 is to characterize the barriers and facilitators to implementation of the proposed
interventions, and determine the intervention costs and potential cost-effectiveness. We will characterize
implementation pathways with a dedicated implementation science evaluation following the Curran type-1

 Excessive lung microvascular endothelial inflammation is a pathological hallmark of acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Upon inflammatory stimuli, lung endothelial cells (ECs)
increase chemokine and adhesion molecule expression, such as IL-6, and intercellular adhesion
molecule 1, ultimately causing neutrophil accumulation at the site of inflammation, endothelial
barrier dysfunction, and lung tissue damage in acute lung injury and sepsis. Nuclear
transcriptional factor κB (NF-κB) plays a pivotal role in EC inflammation. Inflammatory stimuli
trigger phosphorylation of NF-κB component p65, leading to increase p65 transcriptional activity.
We revealed that NF-κBp65 can be ISGylated. The ISGylated p65 is inactive in the resting ECs.
We also discovered that SCFFBXL19 E3 ligase catalyzes ISGylation of p65, impedes p65
phosphorylation, and mitigates lung EC inflammation. These observations led us to hypothesize
that p65 ISGylation by SCFFBXL19 dampens its phosphorylation, transcriptional activation, and lung
EC inflammation; and increases in FBXL19 stability mitigates lung EC inflammation through
reducing NF-kB activation. To better understand the new modification of p65, in this proposal, we
will determine molecular mechanisms by which SCFFBXL19 catalyzes p65 ISGylation and its role in
human lung microvascular EC inflammation. And then, we will determine the molecular
mechanisms by which p65 ISGylation impedes its phosphorylation and activation in human lung
microvascular ECs. Lastly, we will determine if stabilization of FBXL19 alleviates lung EC
inflammation in murine models of acute lung injury and sepsis. This application will be the first to
characterize SCFFBXL19-mediated ISGylation of NF-κBp65 and determine its role in the regulation
of p65 phosphorylation, transcriptional activation, and lung EC inflammation in acute lung injury
and sepsis."

Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) using ex vivo expanded anti-tumor T-cells has garnered significant interest due to
successes in treating melanoma and other cancers. This is a highly personalized therapy, in which autologous
T-cells that can target the tumors are required. However, finding cells that specifically target tumors remains a
major hurdle for the widespread application of T-cell based ACT therapies. The current methods of lymphocyte
enrichment result in modest increases in tumoricidal T-cells with little control over the clonal heterogeneity. A
technology that overcomes these challenges would significantly lower the barriers (e.g., reduce cost, reduce
off-target effects) for broad dissemination of ACT therapies. The primary goal of this project is to develop a
separation technology to enrich a population of lymphocytes with tumoricidal T-cells based on their capacity to
recognize autologous tumor antigens. The premise of our microfluidic technology is that tumoricidal T-cells can
be separated from a bulk leukocyte population when exposed to tumor-derived peptide-major histocompatibility
complex I under optimal flow conditions. The specific aims are to: 1) Develop a microfluidic device to enrich a
population of lymphocytes with antigen specific T-cells, and 2) Demonstrate the capacity of the microfluidic
platform to enrich patient-derived Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells with tumoricidal T-cells using patient-
matched tumor cells. Accomplishing our primary goal will create a potentially disruptive technology that could
pave way for wide-spread application of T-cell based ACT therapies, and the agnostic feature (i.e., no a priori
knowledge of tumor antigen(s) is required) of the technology would make it broadly applicable for a
personalized medicine approach to a range of cancers."

There is no successful biologic treatment for intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD). The goal of this proposal
is to utilize a hydrogel-based engineering approach to deliver PDGF to intervertebral disc (IVD) tissue and
establish PDGF as a potent inhibitor of IDD. We also aim to define the mechanisms underlying its effects on
normal and diseased nucleus pulposus (NP) and annulus fibrosus (AF) cells using human IVDs as well as
preclinical models of IDD.
The scientific premise for the proposed work is a rigorous body of published evidence demonstrating that PDGF-
BB, as well as PDGF-AB can stimulate disc cell growth and/or inhibit their programmed cell death in vitro. Our
compelling preliminary data in vivo point to an anti-apoptotic effect of PDGF-BB in a rabbit puncture model, which
led to restored disc height and enhanced mechanical properties of the treated discs compared to untreated
controls. It is based on these encouraging data and other molecular preliminary data demonstrating that these
anti-apoptotic effects may be mediated through the transcription factor Runx1, that we postulate the novel
hypothesis that sustained exposure of the NP and AF to PDGF will repress IDD progression through controlling
Runx1 activity.
To test this hypothesis, we will first compare the effects of PDGF-BB and PDGF-AB on normal versus diseased
human AF and NP cells cultured in high density. We will then determine the molecular mechanisms underlying
the anti-degenerative effects of PDGF on disc cells through transcriptomic and functional analyses involving
RUNX1 and other signaling molecules (Aim 1A). The validation of Runx1 function in PDGF-mediated effects will
also be examined in vivo using a new gain of function mouse model (Aim 1B). In the second Aim, we will
fabricate and validate the functionality of an injectable biomaterial capable of sustaining the exposure of disc
cells to PDGF-BB (Aim 2A). We will then establish therapeutic modalities for long-term inhibition of IDD in vivo
by PDGF-BB using a rabbit disc puncture model (Aim 2B). Our proposed work will provide seminal information
about the mechanisms underlying PDGF’s effects on the IVD and the role of Runx1 in IDD. The mechanistic
data will help identify new therapeutic targets to treat IDD."

Management of pain arising from orthopedic fractures remains a challenge as common analgesic medications
such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opiates either interfere with healing or possess
unwanted side effects such as dependence. Given the prevalence of pain associated with orthopedic surgeries
and bone fractures, there is an urgent need to develop therapeutic strategies that can mitigate pain while
promoting fracture healing. This motivated us to study the potential use of adenosine (ADO) as a therapeutic
agent for managing fracture pain. ADO is a naturally occurring small molecule that is released upon injury and
elicits analgesic effects in peripheral and central nerves. We and others have shown that extracellular ADO is
an effective osteoanabolic agent promoting bone formation and fracture healing. The osteoanabolic function of
ADO along with the analgesic function makes it an ideal molecule to treat fracture pain. The overarching goal of
the proposal is to assess the use of ADO for the management of pain in fracture injuries by advancing the
fundamental understanding of how ADO mitigates fracture pain and developing new clinically viable therapeutic
strategies. Towards this, Aim 1 of the proposal will develop and characterize an injectable biomaterial for local
delivery of ADO to the fracture site, and determine the dose-dependent effect on fracture healing. To determine
whether biomaterial-assisted local delivery of ADO provides analgesic effects following fracture injury, studies in
Aim 2 will perform behavioral tests for pain, tissue analyses, in vitro analyses by developing DRG-on-Chip
platforms, and RNA sequencing. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that ADO-mediated fracture pain mitigation
involves A1 receptors (A1Rs) by using animals with conditional knockout of A1R in sensory neurons, and
elucidates its regulation of ion channels. Completion of this proposal will establish a new therapeutic molecule
for the care of fracture trauma, and potentially change how bone injuries are treated. The broad impact of our
studies using localized delivery of ADO could be extended to the management of various types of acute and
chronic pain that originate in the peripheral or central nervous system."
10827430,"PROJECT ABSTRACT. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, with non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) the predominant histologic subtype of lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma the major subset
of NSCLC. ALK gene rearrangements (e.g., EML4-ALK fusions) are validated targets in NSCLC and current ALK
kinase inhibitors yield impressive responses. Despite this clinical progress drug resistance remains a problem
that limits patient survival. Improved therapeutic strategies are critical to identify to improve clinical outcomes.
We propose an innovative, multidisciplinary, and collaborative project to hopefully improve the survival of NSCLC
patients by defining a new mechanism of oncogenic signaling that we uncovered by studying ALK fusion
oncoproteins. We aim to capitalize on our discovery of membraneless cytoplasmic protein granules
(condensates) as a distinct mechanism of oncogenic kinase signaling in cancer. Our data suggest an emerging
paradigm in which certain ALK fusion oncoproteins, as well as other clinically-relevant oncoprotein kinase fusions
such as RET fusions, form de novo their own phase separated protein-based subcellular compartment devoid
of lipid membranes and utilize higher-order protein assembly as distinguishing principles underlying oncogenic
output. These membraneless cytoplasmic protein granules comprise a mode of oncogenic signaling that is
different from that of native receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling and oncogenic, mutant forms of other RTKs
such as EGFR, which use classical lipid membrane-based signaling. The pathogenic biomolecular condensates
formed by ALK (and other RTK) fusion oncoproteins locally concentrate the RAS activating complex GRB2/SOS1
and activate RAS in a lipid membrane-independent manner. RTK protein granule formation is critical for
oncogenic RAS/MAPK signaling output in cells. We identified a set of protein granule signaling components and
established structural rules that define ALK protein granule formation. For instance, protein granule formation
requires the adaptor proteins GRB2 and SHC, in addition to the ALK fusion oncoprotein. Our findings reveal
membraneless, higher-order cytoplasmic protein assembly as a distinct subcellular platform for organizing
oncogenic RTK and RAS signaling in cancer. We propose 2 complementary Specific Aims using innovative
methodologies to probe condensate biology to understand the role of phase separation in ALK fusion oncogenic
signaling. We further define the protein architecture of ALK fusion protein granules and identify the key interacting
proteins required for ALK fusion protein granule formation, oncogenic signaling and tumor growth. The proposed
studies will establish a mechanistic understanding of RTK fusion condensate biology to lay a firm foundation for
the future design of mechanism-based therapeutic strategies to interfere with ALK protein granule assembly per
se and that complement conventional ALK-targeted clinical agents, which are ALK kinase inhibitors. This project
will provide insight into this distinct form of oncogenic signaling with a focus on ALK, with broader implications
for the understanding of condensate and RTK fusion biology and the design of differentiated treatment strategies."
10831841,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancer diagnoses among women, and treatment failure of standard
of care (SOC) chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) is as high as 30-50%.
Since recurrent and metastatic diseases are not curable or detected too late to be treatable, there is a pressing
need for pre-treatment biomarkers to identify patients at risk of CRT treatment failure and post-treatment
biomarkers to detect LACC recurrence and metastasis early. TCGA’s effort to establish pre-treatment biomarkers
for cervical cancer by molecular stratification using human genes failed to associate to patient outcomes. On the
other hand, we recently demonstrated that HPV genotypes and HPV alternative splicing affect LACC recurrence
and survival after CRT. In our preliminary data, we additionally identified a diversity of HPV genomic structures
(HPV-GS), including HPV-human gene fusions involving alternative spliced HPV exons, that affect human
oncogene expression. We hypothesize that the variance of HPV genomic structural features among LACC
patients may represent a valuable clinical sequencing application to develop LACC SOC CRT biomarkers. For
post-treatment markers, we currently use F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT (FDG-PET) images at 3–6 months to
define metabolic response, which was shown in our previous publications to predict patterns of failure after
radiotherapy for cervical cancer. We hypothesize that HPV genomic features can serve as post-treatment
biomarkers for LACC recurrence and metastasis detection that are both more accurate and detectable at earlier
timepoints. To achieve these goals, we will first test whether variance in HPV-GS can be utilized to develop a
clinical pre-treatment biomarker by developing a series of novel HPV-GS analysis tools based on our expertise
in both HPV genomics and human structural variants. HPV features will be extracted from matched DNA and
RNA sequencing data, and their prognostic values will be tested using samples from our cervical tumor bank of
LACC patients uniformly treated with curative-intent CRT. Second, we will examine whether CRT-induced LACC
clonal evolution can be used to identify treatment-resistant HPV-GS as on-treatment biomarkers. A novel deep
targeted sequencing approach will be used on single-nucleotide variants (SNV) and HPV-GS to identify LACC
subclones and fit HPV-GS in the context of clonal evolution. We will also examine the mechanisms of HPV-
human gene fusions using clonogenic survival assays and other standard assays. Last, we will use our proven
highly-sensitive and flexible CAPP-Seq technology to evaluate whether circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can be
used to develop HPV-GS tests for early diagnosis and post-CRT recurrence detection. We expect combining
both SNVs and HPV-GS will result in an optimized application superior to using single types of features alone.
Taken together, we expect our genomic and mechanistic research on HPV-GS biomarkers in the context of CRT-
induced LACC evolution will create a series of optimized pre-treatment and recurrence biomarkers that can be
applied in the clinic for personalized alternative treatment regimens."
10871683,"Background: Conventional recommendations in national prevention guidelines often fail to address
differences in outcome risk and life expectancy across the target population. By ignoring such differences,
conventional recommendations can inadvertently lead to substantial underuse (by excluding Veterans with
potentially high net benefit who do not meet a conventional cutoff) and overuse (by including Veterans for
whom net benefit would be limited). Further, minoritized patients who could most benefit from prevention are
often disproportionately excluded by conventional recommendations, exacerbating racial disparities. The long-
term goal of the proposed research is to support optimal preventive care decisions for all Veterans. The overall
objective of this proposal is to study an alternative guideline approach (“tailored” recommendations based on
multivariable prediction) that can better support individualized prevention efforts. A second goal is to study the
extent to which optimizing decisions for individuals can broaden the public health impact of preventive care
programs within VA. We use lung cancer screening, statin use, and blood pressure treatment as case studies
as they are ideal models for studying the key issues.
Significance: This work is significant because current knowledge gaps in guideline development, which we
address in this proposal, inhibit progress toward more nuanced preventive care recommendations that often
better identify high-benefit patients and enable more Veteran-centered care.
Innovation and Impact: The proposed research is innovative because it will advance a different paradigm for
developing preventive care guidelines both within and outside VA, which will open new horizons for optimizing
the delivery of cancer screening, cardiovascular prevention, and other prevention. The rationale underlying the
proposed work is that its successful completion would enable guideline-level assessment of when tailored
recommendations would be highly advantageous, to promote more effective and personalized care and
reduce racial disparities.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Estimate “individualized” net benefit for lung cancer screening, statin use, and blood
pressure treatment. Aim 2: Estimate the comparative effects of conventional recommendations vs. tailored
recommendations. Aim 3: Identify best practices for examining tailored recommendations in future guidelines.
Methods: Under Aim 1, we will adapt existing microsimulation models for each preventive service to estimate
the distribution of predicted (“individualized”) net benefit across the target Veteran population. This will inform
the development of tailored recommendations under the guidance of the Aim 3 Expert Panel. Then, in Aim 2,
we will use Aim 1 microsimulation evidence to examine the pros and cons of conventional vs. tailored
approaches, again with close input from the Expert Panel. For Aim 3a, an Expert Advisory Panel of guideline
experts will engage in a longitudinal process to identify best practices for conducting and presenting these
microsimulation analyses in the development of future preventive care guidelines. In Aim 3b, interviews with
guideline stakeholders will assess the potential for this microsimulation evidence to influence how future
recommendations are established.
Next steps/Implementation: The final product will be new guideline-level methods to support the adoption of
tailored recommendations in national guidelines, when doing so would improve care (particularly among
minority groups) and enable more Veteran-centered shared decision making. We will disseminate our work
through professional channels, including through multiple research publications and presentations. Our strong
engagement with VA guideline partners and experts from influential national guideline groups will facilitate
wide dissemination of these methods to guideline groups. Our separate line of research to study and
implement clinical decision support tools will support the downstream implementation of the proposed work."
10808948,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most deadly human cancers and in ~95%
of cases driven by oncogenic mutations of Kras. Unfortunately, attempts to directly inhibit
oncogenic Kras or Ras effector pathways have been largely ineffective in treating PDAC due to
the development of resistance. Yap (Yes-associated-protein), an oncogenic transcription
regulator, not only is required for PDAC progression but also confers resistance to extinction of
oncogenic Kras signaling and other therapeutic agents in advanced PDAC tumors. Using a next-
generation inducible genetic engineered mouse model, we discovered that even though PDAC
tumors rely on Yap to maintain the transcriptional output necessary for tumor growth and survival,
a subpopulation of tumor cells with stem/progenitor-like characteristics undergo epigenetic
reprogramming eventually overcoming their Yap addiction in late stage PDAC. In this grant we
propose a multi-faceted effort to elucidate the molecular/cellular drivers of adaptive
reprogramming in Yap-ablated, advanced PDAC tumors, and explore novel therapeutic strategies
to overcome resistance to Yap blockade. Furthermore, we will use an inducible genetic lineage-
tracing model to track how the cancer “stem/progenitor” niches contribute to PDAC invasion,
metastasis and resistance to Yap ablation. Together, these experiments will not only provide
critical insights into the mechanisms underlying PDAC plasticity, but also inform potential new
strategies to overcome therapeutic resistance in PDAC."
10845490,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Patients who recover from the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may experience a range of long-
term health consequences. Since the lung is the primary site of viral infection, pulmonary sequelae may present
persistently in COVID-19 survivors. Thus, clinical assessment of COVID-19 survivors in conjunction with chest
X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) is recommended. CXR is more accessible, whereas CT provides
more detailed information. Our long-term goal is to develop an integrated deep learning model that can assess
lung images to assist with the management and treatment of long-term sequelae of post-COVID-19 subjects.
The primary objective of the proposed research is to advance contrastive self-supervised learning models that
take advantage of the accessibility of CXR scanners and the accuracy of CT images, identify the subtypes in
patients with post-COVID-19, and characterize clinical, imaging and mechanistic biomarkers within subtypes.
Our central hypothesis is that post-COVID-19 subtypes exist and they are characterized by distinct progression
phenotypes. To test this hypothesis and achieve the primary objective, we will perform the following four specific
aims. In Aim 1, we will advance contrastive learning methods to handle large-scale images with low training
costs, and fine-tune the classifier and the encoder network on large-scale CXR images to detect post-COVID-
19 subjects. In Aim 2, we will advance contrastive learning methods that learn from CT images acquired at
different volumes and different times to differentiate post-COVID-19 subjects from other cohorts and identify
subtypes. In Aim 3, we will apply computational fluid and particle dynamics techniques to derive mechanistic
biomarkers to explain the associations between clinical and imaging biomarkers in post-COVID-19 subtypes. In
Aim 4, we will conduct a human subject study that examines post-COVID-19 subjects at 36-48 months after
initial follow-up visits to assess the progression features of their clinical and imaging biomarkers. In summary,
we will advance contrastive self-supervised learning algorithms based on CXR and CT images, respectively, for
accessibility (Aim 1) and accuracy (Aim 2). We will generate in silico data for feature interpretability (Aim 3) and
gather in vivo data for model training and validation (Aim 4). The pre-trained model from Aim 2 will be fine-tuned
via transfer learning to input CXR images that are classified as post-COVID-19 by the model from Aim 1. An
integrated deep learning model based on the two models from Aim 1 and 2 will take CXR images as inputs to
provide CT-based detailed phenotypic information together with mechanistically and clinically meaningful
interpretation. If successful, our study will not only advance contrastive learning algorithms, but also elucidate
the pulmonary sequelae of post-COVID-19 patients in subtypes and associated clinical, imaging and mechanistic
biomarkers. The ability to identify progression subtypes and associated phenotypic biomarkers will have a
positive impact on the management and treatment of patients with post-COVID-19."
10849641,"In this proposal we will uncover the fundamental mechanisms by which cellular factors of the RNA helicase superfamily and virus encoded host range factors modulate each other’s function, which is key for virus-host interactions, innate immunity, cellular transformation and use of oncolytic viruses for cancer treatment. Myxoma virus (MYXV) is a rabbit specific poxvirus that also exhibits the capacity to infect a wide spectrum of human cancer and transformed cells. MYXV is currently being developed as an oncolytic virotherapeutic to treat various classes of cancer. We have recently reported the identification of members of cellular DEAD-box containing RNA helicases that tightly regulate the tropism of MYXV in human cancer cells. One of our goals is to discover the novel virus-host interactions and dissect the pro- vs anti-viral functions of selected key RNA helicases in human cells. In addition, we discovered that blocking the exportin1-nuclear export pathway not only enhances viral replication but also synergistically promotes killing of human cancer cells without affecting normal human cells. Our goal is to study the in vitro and in vivo impact of this nuclear export pathway in MYXV oncolytic virotherapy. We will continue our effort on understanding the function of two key MYXV host range proteins M029 and M-T5. M029 is a member of the poxvirus E3 family of dsRNA Binding Domain (dsRBD) containing proteins, which modulates the functions of key anti-viral RNA helicases such as DHX9 and PKR in human cancer cells. M-T5 is a member of the ANK family of proteins, and our new preliminary data suggests that M-T5 is required for the enhanced MYXV replication in human cancer cells when nuclear export pathway is inhibited. Thus, our goal is to further understand the host range and immune regulatory functions of M029 and M-T5. Based on our observations we propose to investigate the followings: 1. Elucidate the role of select RNA helicases in MYXV replication and cellular tropism. We propose to investigate the anti-viral and pro-viral functions of key cellular RNA helicases that regulate MYXV tropism in human cancer cells and primary immune cells. 2. Investigate the role of M029 in cellular tropism and innate immune responses. We will dissect the molecular mechanisms by which M029 modulates different cellular pathways in cancer and innate immune cells that depend upon nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of host restriction factors. We will identify additional M029 and host interactions and dissect the mechanisms by which the M029 interacting proteins DHX9 and PKR regulate MYXV tropism and oncolysis of human cancer cells. 3. Investigate how combination of nuclear export inhibitor and oncolytic MYXV enhances virus replication, cancer cell killing, and oncolytic virotherapy. We will perform in vitro and in vivo studies to understand the mechanisms how inhibition of nuclear export pathway enhances MYXV replication and oncolytic activity in cancer cell, where MYXV replication is restricted. Additionally, we will investigate the role of MYXV-encoded ANK protein M-T5, which is required for this enhanced virus replication when nuclear export pathway is restricted."
10883552,"Background: VHA has committed to building the Whole Health system of care in which Veterans are
empowered and equipped to pursue their best possible vision of health and well-being through self-care,
conventional clinical care, and complementary and integrative health services. A key component of this system
is Whole Health Coaching (WH-Coaching), a service that pairs Veterans with trained professionals who deliver
extended, one-on-one support for setting and achieving personally meaningful health and well-being goals.
WH Coaches are being increasingly integrated into Veteran care, yet very little guidance exists on the best
practices for using this inherently “whole person” approach when coaching Veterans with complex clinical
needs. With my background in qualitative research methods and implementation science, I am well-positioned
to fill this gap in our knowledge. However, I still require additional training in theory-driven evaluation and
complex systems approaches, quantitative research methods, co-design, and implementation/hybrid trials to
succeed in the proposed study and my broader career goals. After pursuing mentored research and training as
a CDA awardee, I will be well underway toward my career goal of becoming a nationally recognized VA
researcher with expertise in implementing patient-centered care to improve the well-being and experiences
with care for Veterans with complex chronic conditions.
Significance/Impact: Implementing the Whole Health system of care is a major priority for VHA and VA, as
reflected in VA’s FY2018-2024 and FY2022-2028 Strategic Plans, the 2019 VHA Modernization Plan, and the
2020 VHA Vision Plan. The proposed CDA will provide OPCC&CT and VHA with insights that will inform the
ongoing rollout of WH-Coaching for years to come. By focusing on optimizing the implementation of WH-
Coaching for Veterans with COPD, the study is also poised to improve the quality of care, experiences with
care, and the quality of life for this large, important patient population. My partnership with the Office of Patient-
centered Care & Cultural Transformation (OPCC&CT) is an additional testament to the study’s significance.
Innovation: To our knowledge, there is no published or unpublished research on the existing approaches to
implementing WH-Coaching for Veterans with COPD and/or best practices for improving its implementation.
Moreover, the use of realist evaluation and co-design approaches in Aims 2 and 3 is methodologically
innovative.
Specific Aims: (1) Assess the impact of WH-Coaching on healthcare utilization and smoking cessation
outcomes for Veterans with COPD. (2) Identify barriers and facilitators of effective WH-Coaching for Veterans
with COPD. (3) Co-design a toolkit with best practices for effective partnership between WH Coaches and
Veterans with COPD.
Methods: In Aim 1, I will analyze CDW data to identify longitudinal trends in healthcare utilization and smoking
cessation outcomes for a national cohort of Veterans with COPD who used WH-Coaching in the prior 2 fiscal
years. In Aim 2, guided by an innovative realist evaluation framework, I will use a combination of observations,
interviews with the key stakeholders (Veterans, WH Coaches, clinicians), and artifact analysis to understand
which factors enable or, conversely, hamper Veterans’ ability to derive benefits from participation at 6
purposively selected VA sites. In Aim 3, I will involve a group of Veterans with COPD, WH Coaches, and
clinicians in co-designing a toolkit with best practices for Veterans with COPD and WH Coaches who work with
them to ensure more effective implementation of WH-Coaching for this population.
Next Steps: The CDA will inform at least three IIRs: (1) a national survey of patient-reported outcomes of WH-
Coaching; (2) an expert panel study expanding the toolkit developed in Aim 3 to other complex chronic
conditions with expert panel input; and (3) a hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial of the toolkit."

This T32 renewal application seeks support for the multidisciplinary education of trainees in Alzheimer’s disease
and Related Dementia (ADRD). The goal of this program is to train the next generation of creative and
meritorious ADRD researchers at the predoctoral level. We acknowledge that the development of future therapy
for dementia will require strong training in multiple disciplines, such as, the molecular biology of dementia, drug
discovery and development, clinical studies and the analysis of large data sets. We will answer the imperative
need for scientists who can synthesize across disciplines. Our Training Program comprises of four
discplines/themes: (1) biological mechanisms (2) drug discovery and development (3) clinical ADRD (4)
computational science. Each student gets trained in at least two of the four disciplines, utilizing a multidisciplinary
approach for tackling scientific questions in ADRD. Attentive to the latest recommendation of the NIA and
Alzheimer’s Association guidelines, there will be special emphasize on the analysis of lifestyle, environmental
factors and preventative approaches for ADRD. The mentor/preceptor team has outstanding expertise to
establish this innovative, interdisciplinary training program, to integrate otherwise disparate centers of excellence
at UIC and Rush, leveraged by industry collaborations. Preceptor expertise is diverse; from molecular
mechanisms of dementia, vascular biology, diabetes and inflammation, neuronal and neural imaging to clinical
diagnosis of human ADRD patients and large scale data analysis. Expertise is from 12 departments and 6
clinical and translational entities. We will train ADRD researchers with diverse backgrounds and cross-
disciplinary skills, including neuroscientists, but also computational biologists, chemists, and engineers
interested in translational ADRD research. To facilitate interdisciplinary training, trainees will have two preceptors
from different disciplines. We will build individual development plans (IDPs) for each trainee and offer
multidisciplinary coursework from ADRD-TP faculty and pharma scientists. Importantly, trainees can perform
translational research at any of the affiliated clinical and translational entities. Trainees will be encouraged to
collaborate with large community-based NIH-supported studies (ROS/MAP) or NIA’s large-scale collaborative
consortia (AMP-AD, M2OVE-AD, ADNI, ACTC), and with our pharma partners, Eli Lilly, Abbott and Baxter.
Trainees are encouraged to participate in workshops geared towards -omics and drug discovery and the
CIM/MATTER entrepreneurial program that aids commercialization of scientific innovation. We seek to support
6 predoctoral trainees. The success of this program in the last five years is reflected by our alumni who have
moved on to successful careers in academia and pharma. The ADRD-TP’s vitality is reflected by the numbers
of highly qualified applicants and state-of-the-art scientific endevours and publications. We expect the next five
year to surpass this success. In summary, the ADRD-TP will provide a rigorous, inspiring and nurturing
environment to ensure training of the highest level of scientists needed to unravel dementia."

This is the competing renewal application for a highly successful T32 program that has trained more than 200
predoctoral students in toxicology/environmental health sciences (EHS) over the last 45 years. The objective of
this predoctoral program is to train the next generation of environmental health scientists through interdisciplinary
research and coursework that addresses issues of direct relevance to the NIEHS mission. We are requesting 2
years of support for each of 8 predoctoral trainees beginning after their first or second year in a PhD degree
program. Trainees are recruited from several UC Davis graduate programs that provide disciplinary training
relevant to EHS, including toxicology, cell and molecular biology, exposure assessment, chemistry, pathobiology,
epidemiology, neuroscience, immunology, and genetics. The training faculty – 35 active researchers from 20
departments - have substantial experience mentoring predoctoral students. Faculty research focuses on
mechanisms by which environmental factors contribute to human disease and encompasses diverse areas within
EHS. Close collaboration among training faculty members, through joint participation in Centers and Graduate
Programs as well as joint funding, promotes interdisciplinary approaches to EHS research. Trainees have access
to advanced technologies, such as proteomics, epi/genomics, and metabolomics, state-of-the-art imaging,
genetically modified organisms, and inhalation facilities for rodents and non-human primates. A strength of EHS
research at UC Davis is the vertical integration of studies directed towards understanding environmentally
induced disease. Complementing human clinical samples and epidemiologic studies, students have access to
diverse animal models, including nonhuman primates, and ranging through nontraditional models in the lab to
field studies of populations. In these models, students typically initiate molecular, cellular and/or tissue studies
under the guidance of their faculty mentor and with input from the training faculty. The training program leverages
the activities and resources of research centers and programs to provide synergy between disease prevention
and public health while interacting with students early in their scientific training. The training program
emphasizes practical instruction in scientific writing and communication of scientific findings to peers and lay
audiences through chalk talks, annual retreats, trainee mini presentations for invited speakers, outreach activities
with community groups, and participation in national meetings. Two key events expose trainees to emerging
concepts, controversies, and technologies in environmental health. The first is a seminar series featuring leading
environmental health scientists that is organized and managed by the trainees themselves. The second is a
summer course in which trainees explore a current issue relevant to environmental health under the close
guidance of training faculty. Trainees receive training in responsible conduct of research as well as rigor and
transparency woven into these events but also in special sessions. The training program has an excellent track
record of training leaders in EHS."
10866584,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a complex age-dependent disorder. It requires multiple approaches to comprehensively understand at a molecular level in order to develop novel diagnostics and disease modifying treatments. Astrocytes and neurons coexist in the brain and both major cell types are known to contribute to AD. The cellular phase of AD is proposed to comprise feedback and feedforward signaling between diverse brain cells as a link between the initial emergence of molecular pathology (abnormal tau and Aβ) and subsequent disease manifestations. Known glial cell proteins that contribute to this cellular phase are APOE and TREM2, and are associated with significantly increased risk of AD. Moreover, known astrocyte mechanisms include reactivity, which is a complex, non-binary phenomenon with sequelae that depends on context. In the past, most disease related studies have evaluated astrocytes or neurons using assessments of physiology, markers, or with gene expression evaluations. Astrocytes and neurons have not been studied in detail together or with cell-type specific proteomic methods, as proposed here and as requested by the FOA. As a result, despite advances, we have little precise information about the proteomes of astrocytes and neurons during aging in brain areas relevant to AD or in brain regions relevant to specific and defined abnormalities such as seizure activity in AD. Our overarching hypothesis is that astrocytes and neurons display protein dynamics during normal ageing and in mouse models of AD and that these changes reflect signaling between these dominant brain cells during the cellular phase of AD pathogenesis and during aberrant seizure activity and its associated cognitive decline in AD. Aim 1 will characterize cell, brain region, and compartment (plasma membrane versus cytosol) specific proteomic methods for astrocytes and neurons. Aim 2 will determine astrocyte and neuron proteomic dynamics during normal aging in mice. Aim 3 will determine astrocyte and neuron proteomic dynamics during aberrant network activity in AD model mice. Understanding the identities and the extent of cell, brain region, and compartment-specific protein changes for the major brain cell types (astrocytes and neurons) using data-driven unbiased approaches could be foundational and catalytic with regards to new opportunities for translational and mechanistic work."

The obesity epidemic is a global public health issue, that leads to an increased risk for type 2 diabetes and
cardiovascular disease. Hypertrophy, inflammation, and excess lipid accumulation in white adipocytes within
fat tissue are hallmarks of obesity that contribute to metabolic dysfunction. Unlike white adipocytes, beige
adipocytes are rich in mitochondria, and expend energy to generate heat (thermogenesis) in response to
stimuli such as cold exposure. This activity is associated with resistance to diet-induced obesity, and thus
activation and expansion of beige adipocytes can counteract the obesity phenotype. During beige adipocyte
activation, optimal thermogenic function is maintained by balancing mitochondrial biogenesis with autophagy-
mediated mitochondrial degradation (mitophagy), which is finely coordinated to maintain mitochondrial
homeostasis. Using our newly developed model of beige adipocyte differentiation and activation from human
iPS cells, we discovered that thermogenic activation of beige adipocytes occurs following enhanced secretion
of exosomes containing a variety of microRNAs (miRs), including miR-27a/b. miR-27 homologs (miR-27a/b)
are anti-thermogenic miRs that suppress genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (such as FOXJ3) and
mitophagy (including MFF). miR-27a/b are down-regulated in beige adipocytes during thermogenic activation,
consistent with their predicted role as inhibitors of mitochondrial activation, turnover, and biogenesis. This
project tests several hypotheses related to mechanisms of beige adipocyte activation. We propose that the
miR-27 suppresses adipocyte thermogenesis by targeting FOXJ3 and MFF and that loss of miR-27a/b and
increase in FOXJ3/MFF-mediated pathways activate mitochondrial activity and thermogenesis. We also
propose that in vivo genetic targeting of miR-27a/b will allow us to identify the in vivo role of these miRs in
beige adipocyte activation, regulation of mitochondrial proteins, thermogenesis and resistance to obesity.
These questions will be tested in two focused specific aims:
Specific Aim 1. Identify the mechanism of miR-27 regulation of beige adipocyte mitochondrial function.
Specific Aim 2. Determine the effect of miR-27 suppression on the response of beige adipose tissue to
temperature challenge and high-fat diet.
These studies are expected to identify novel molecular mechanisms that may provide a new platform to
increase beige adipogenesis and reverse obesity-related disorders."
10846842,"Project Abstract/Summary
 Cells utilize an array of actin binding proteins with diverse and complementary properties to
assemble, maintain and disassemble a range of distinct F-actin networks to facilitate different
fundamental functions including motility, polarization and division. To serve its function, each of these
networks has a unique architecture defined by the number, lengths and connectivity of its filaments,
which is maintained by a continuous dynamical balance of actin filament assembly, remodeling and
disassembly. A fundamental challenge is to understand how functional network architectures are formed
and maintained by the continuous coupling of architecture and assembly dynamics. Here we are
focusing on the cell cortex, a dynamic network of actin filaments, crosslinkers and myosin motors, lying
just beneath the plasma membrane, that undergoes rapid deformation and flow to drive cell movement,
polarization, division and tissue morphogenesis. How ensembles of actin regulatory factors work in
concert to simultaneously regulate actin filament network architecture assembly and dynamics at the
cortex of living cells is poorly understood. The one cell C. elegans embryo provides a uniquely powerful
opportunity to address these questions in a single large cell, that is directly accessible to high resolution
microscopy, with powerful genetics, transgenics, CRISPR and RNAi. The C. elegans cortex is primarily
composed of an F-actin network of linear filaments and small filament bundles that are assembled by
formin CYK-1-mediated polymerization of profilin-actin, and decorated by actin filament crosslinkers
plastin PLST-1, anillin ANI-1, and by mini-filaments of non-muscle myosin II NMY-2. Conversely, cofilin
UNC-60A and capping protein CAP-1/CAP-2 appear to be key regulators of filament disassembly and
filament length, respectively.
 We are addressing how the C. elegans cortical F-actin network architecture is formed and
maintained through the dynamic integration of formin-dependent filament assembly, filament
crosslinking, filament capping, and cofilin-dependent filament disassembly, all while the network
experiences continuous myosin-driven deformation and flow. We are combining the complementary
state-of-the-art in vivo expertise (quantitative single molecule imaging and particle analysis) and in vitro
expertise (reconstitution and biophysical analysis) of the Ed Munro and David Kovar lab's to address two
major questions concerning the architecture and dynamics of the C. elegans F-actin cortex. First, we will
characterize the fundamental dynamics, regulation and feedback control of formin-mediated actin
filament and bundle assembly (Aim 1). Second, we will investigate the fundamental dynamics, regulation
and feedback control of cofilin-mediated actin filament disassembly of the formin actin filament networks
(Aim 2)."
10886532,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A fundamental question in biology is to understand how genetic variation affects genome function to influence
phenotypes. The majority of genetic variants associated with human diseases are located within non-coding
genomic regions and may affect genome functions and phenotypes through modulating the activity of cis-
regulatory elements and cell-type specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs). However, our knowledge about
the impact of genomic variants (alone or as combinations) on gene expression, GRN activity and ultimately
cellular phenotypes are rather limited. Further, because transcription factors (TFs) and related cis-regulatory
elements are known to have distinct functions based on cell-type and state, how genomic variants influence
cell-type/state-specific activity of functional elements and phenotypes remains to be characterized in much
greater details.
This proposal aims to leverage a panel of multi-ethnic, gender-balanced human induced pluripotent stem cell
(hiPSC) lines (European, African American and African hunter gatherers) as well as recent advances in single-
cell time-resolved or multi-omics technologies, predictive modeling of regulatory networks by machine learning
and high throughput single-cell perturbation methods to study the functional impact of genomic variations on
regulatory network, cellular phenotypes. First, we will establish a robust experimental framework of deploying
advanced time-resolved and multi-omic single-cell technologies for detecting functional genetic variants at
single-cell level. Next, we will develop novel computational methods for integration of single-cell data across
different modalities and for accurate reconstruction and predictive modeling of GRNs driving cellular identify,
developmental dynamics (cardiac and neural lineage cell fate transition). Finally, we will apply high-throughput
combinatorial genetic or epigenetic perturbation approaches to modulate activity of key genes or putative cis-
regulatory elements at single-cell levels to improve our understanding of network level relationships among
genomic variants and phenotypes."

African Americans continue to experience disparities for colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and deaths
compared to other racial/ethnic groups in the US and adherence with evidence-based CRC screening
recommendations can reduce these disparities. Advantages of stool-based CRC screening tests compared to
other screening methods include convenience and lower cost. However, stool-based CRC screening generally
must be done annually and individuals who screen abnormally must be able to access and complete a screening
colonoscopy following a positive result on a stool-based test. Patients who are uninsured or have inadequate
health insurance or face financial or structural obstacles may require additional support from their community
health center (CHC) to complete a screening colonoscopy, and CHCs may experience challenges securing
access to colonoscopy for such patients. The Test Up Now Education Program (TUNE-UP) is a 5-year behavioral
clinical trial for African Americans ages 45-64 who are patients at one of two partnering north Florida CHCs and
tests whether an innovative 6-week community health advisor (CHA) intervention can increase stool-based CRC
screening compared to a usual care approach. Participants are surveyed at baseline, 3-months and 9-12 months
to measure the primary study outcome, completion of stool-based screening. In this follow-up monitoring study
now being proposed, we will reestablish contact with TUNE-UP participants and obtain informed consent to
examine if there was a sustained effect of the CHA intervention for two ensuing annual screenings and whether
outcomes vary longitudinally. Thus, we present a time-sensitive proposal to assess repeat annual screening in
this CHC patient cohort. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that CHC patients who participated in the TUNE-UP trial
and received the CHA intervention will show a higher likelihood of adherence with subsequent stool-based CRC
screening than TUNE-UP participants who had been assigned to the usual care study group. Aim 2 of the
proposed study will utilize a community-partnered participatory research (CPPR) framework to explore the CHC
context for implementing CRC screening educational interventions among African American patients in north
Florida. The proposed TUNE-UP Monitoring Study is significant, innovative and timely in addressing persistent
disparities in CRC incidence and mortality among African Americans through convenient and accessible stool-
based screening in the context of recently updated USPSTF recommendations to begin CRC screening at age
45. Additionally, this research will enable monitoring of CRC preventive screening programs amid the challenges
of the Covid-19 pandemic and will increase understanding of the relationships between decision-making factors
and CRC screening among African Americans. This research program will also improve the research capacity
of Florida A&M University to conduct research in partnership with health centers and involve graduate students."
10839317,"Given the growing burden of substance use and rapid shifts in how we study substance use (SU) and
substance use disorders (SUDs), there is a critical need for a well-trained and diverse workforce to conduct
impactful research on SU and the complexity of its consequences. Responding to this need, we propose renewal
of the Drug Dependence Epidemiology Training (DDET) program at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of
Health (JHBSPH). DDET has provided research training for >29 years and has produced many of the nation’s
leading SU researchers. We benefit from strong institutional support for training, comprehensive course
offerings in epidemiology and statistics, and research in SU at JHBSPH and across Johns Hopkins University.
 Recent accomplishments have been exceptional, indicating that DDET continues to make a tremendous
impact on the field. Among those who completed training in the current project period, all predoctorates
completed their doctoral degrees in 4 years; all trainees (both pre- and postdoctoral) continued in research
careers; and 8 (of 13) postdoctorates are in faculty positions.
 The DDET team includes two co-directors (Maher, Johnson), five associate directors (Sherman, Latkin,
Mojtabai, Linton, Thrul), and 33 additional faculty (9 core, 24 affiliate). The participating faculty have sub-
stantial research expertise in substance use and SUDs, and all will work together to implement the training plan
and provide trainees with opportunities to engage in supervised research.
 The DDET program has strong and stable leadership, highly-qualified faculty, clear and relevant program
goals, and an ongoing record of excellence. Our mission is to create the next generation of scientists who will
tackle the challenges of substance use, SUDs, and their related harms. Our 5-year goals are to train scholars
who will: [1] investigate the causes and consequences of substance use and SUDs; [2] respond to gaps in
treatment and services for SUDs; and [3] develop, implement, evaluate, and scale-up interventions to address
substance use, SUDs, and their related harms.
 DDET is designed to provide broad knowledge in the fundamentals of research in substance use
epidemiology, services, and prevention, as well as specialized training in one or more of the focal areas. With
this competing renewal, we propose to provide cross-disciplinary, specialized research training in drug use for 7
pre- and 7 post-doctoral scholars. We have identified 5 focal areas that will enhance the quality and relevance
of training, each is led by an associate director. Focal areas include: [1] harm reduction & overdose prevention;
[2] interventions for SUD & infectious disease; [3] SUD & psychiatric comorbidities; [4] structural
determinants & drug control; and [5] emerging trends & technologies. Cross-cutting training areas include
polysubstance use, health equity, and human dignity. Training activities include coursework, seminars and
webinars, research apprenticeships, participation in scholarly meetings, and other integrative activities."

 The objective of this project is to develop a safe and effective dynamic cognitive aid application for use
through a head-mounted display (HMD), to reduce error rates associated with pediatric medication
administration (PMA) by emergency medical services (EMS). This objective will be achieved by examining
characteristics associated with PMA, using a design thinking process to develop a prototype application,
examining usability of the prototype, and testing the safety and efficacy in a randomized controlled trial.
 Errors associated with PMA in EMS are alarmingly high. Numerous studies have shown that there is a 31%
error rate across all drugs administered to children by EMS. Medications such as midazolam and fentanyl have
even higher rates at 61% and 65%, respectfully, with many being 10-fold errors. Sadly, previous strategies
have had little impact on reducing error rates below 31%. System changes have failed due to inconsistencies
in EMS systems, and challenges associated with medication shortages. Previously developed cognitive aids
have fallen short often due to the fact they generally act as simple reference tools and do not address all
causes of error associated with PMA. As a result, we are proposing the most comprehensive design process
ever taken to combat this issue, utilizing advanced technology, to implement a dynamic cognitive aid to help
providers improve dosing accuracy during PMA.
 We hypothesize that PMA errors in EMS will be significantly reduced by this application due to the
comprehensive and rigorous design thinking process we will utilize followed by a randomized controlled trial to
test safety and efficacy. Our interdisciplinary team will combine the fields of pediatric emergency medicine,
EMS, engineering, computer science and user interface/user experience to address this issue with the support
and effort of two medical schools in Michigan. In SA1 we will develop a prototype application. This will begin
with identifying user and contextual information associated with PMA, and examine failure modes, root causes,
and a task analysis of the procedure. We will then proceed into a comprehensive design thinking process to
develop the application. During this process we will also create a desktop program that will allow EMS agency
administrators to add new medications to the HMD application. In SA2, we will examine usability of the HMD
application and associated desktop program in a simulation-based environment with a sample of end users,
examining task duration, cognitive load and error rates and make any necessary refinements. In SA3, we will
test the HMD application in a simulation-based randomized controlled trial to examine its safety and efficacy for
use in EMS. This will result in a safe and effective tool to mitigate this alarming issue in the vulnerable EMS
pediatric population."

Ultrasound is one of the most widely used medical imaging modalities worldwide, with recent usage growth
attributed to swift technology advancements in complementary subdisciplines. Ultrasound technology
development continues to advance at lighting pace, with new capabilities rapidly maturing as the latest
contributions from a wide spectrum of interdisciplinary fields converge. In concert with ultrasound’s inherent
safety, cost efficiency, and portability (which make it the only accessible imaging modality to much of the
world’s population), the potential for advanced ultrasound to dramatically impact patient care is enormous.
However, to fully realize this potential, such exciting innovations must become commercially available.
Therefore, it is vitally important to prepare the next generation of ultrasound engineers to develop ultrasound
innovations that are clinically meaningful and commercially relevant. To meet this critical need, the Unified
Medical Ultrasound Technology Development (UNMUTED) pre-doctoral training program combines clinically-
oriented, world-class instruction in the physics and engineering of medical ultrasound technology development
with preparation for commercial translation. Importantly, training is done in the context of The Research
Triangle Park region of North Carolina, a prominent biotechnology hub and home to an unrivaled consortium of
ultrasound technology experts. By participating in the UNMUTED predoctoral training program, trainees
will uniquely gain the collaborative, technical, and commercialization skills necessary to transition
their work from advanced research and development to commercially available products that
meaningfully impact patient care. Specific Aim #1 is to give trainees first-hand experience communicating
and collaborating with physician scientists to identify new ultrasound applications that meet clinically important
needs. Specific Aim #2 is to provide trainees an unparalleled foundation in the physics and engineering of
medical ultrasound to move from initial ideation, to feasible implementation, to clinical validation. Specific Aim
#3 is to prepare trainees to commercially translate advanced ultrasound technologies through a combination of
didactic training and mentorship by ultrasound entrepreneurs and industry experts. Additional professional
skills development, including in effective written and oral communication, scientific rigor, and the responsible
conduct of research, will be a highlight of the training experience. UNMUTED will be administered by the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and North Carolina State University (NCSU) Joint
Department of Biomedical Engineering and directed by Dr. Caterina Gallippi, a Professor in the UNC, NCSU
Joint Department of Biomedical Engineering and a seasoned expert in medical ultrasound technology
development with extensive experience in doctoral education. Dr. Gallippi will be assisted by two Associate
Directors and a Senior Advisory Committee."
10754585,"Dr. Sloan is a general internist and health services researcher whose long-term career goal is to evaluate
the effectiveness of policies and interventions that address barriers to care for older adults with multimorbidity.
 Many patients with multimorbidity struggle to pay for their medications. These patients have lower medication
adherence, resulting in a higher risk of disease progression, functional limitations, hospitalization, and death.
Patients cannot account for medication costs in their medical decisions, because they rarely know what those
costs will be before getting to the pharmacy. If clinicians could access information about their patients’ medica-
tion-related out-of-pocket costs at the point-of-prescribing, they could help their patients apply for financial sup-
port, or prescribe lower-cost alternatives. New out-of-pocket drug price transparency tools could fill this need.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently mandated that Medicare Part D plans make clinician-
facing out-of-pocket drug price transparency tools available to clinics and hospitals via the electronic health
record (EHR). No one has described the uptake and acceptability of these tools, or their impact on clinical out-
comes among middle-aged and older patients with multimorbidity.
 The goal of this K23 award is to evaluate how primary care providers at one large academic health system
use a widely available price transparency tool and how price transparency at the point-of-prescribing affects
clinical outcomes for middle-aged and older patients with multimorbidity. This health system’s price transparency
tool, adopted in 2019, is compatible with all Medicare plans and ~95% of private insurance plans in its state. In
Aims 1 and 2, Dr. Sloan will describe the uptake and acceptability of the price transparency tool using an ex-
planatory sequential mixed methods design. In Aim 1, she will conduct an EHR-based retrospective cohort study
of ~700 clinicians and ~140,000 patients aged >50 with multimorbidity to determine the clinician and patient
factors associated with use. In Aim 2, she will conduct ~24 semi-structured interviews to explore reasons for use
/ non-use that may not be readily available in EHR data. Interviews will also assess the tool’s acceptability and
feasibility for use among patients with multimorbidity. In Aim 3, she will conduct an EHR- and claims-based
longitudinal retrospective cohort study to evaluate how use of the tool affects adherence and diabetes control in
a subgroup of ~29,000 patients aged >50 with diabetes and multimorbidity.
 Throughout the award, Dr. Sloan will pursue training in geriatric and multimorbidity research, medical deci-
sion-making, mixed methods, and program evaluation methods. Results from this award will directly inform the
development of a multisite evaluation of price transparency tool implementation at institutions with different ge-
ographies, patient populations, and practice patterns. The rigorous training and mentorship provided by this
award, as well as Duke University’s superb research environment, will prepare Dr. Sloan well for a career dedi-
cated to improving access to affordable care for middle-aged and older adults with multimorbidity."

Stroke affects more than 795,000 patients per year in the US and kills approximately 40,000. Long-term medical
care expense for stroke in the US, costs over $34B per year. Large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke accounts for
almost 40% of ischemic strokes but causes 95% of mortality and 62% of long-term dependence. Mechanical
thrombectomy (MT), or a combination of MT and tPA, has emerged as standard of care treatment of LVO stroke.
Up to 60% of thrombectomy patients are first evaluated at spoke hospitals and transferred to hub hospitals for
MT. `Time is brain' following stroke, the sooner therapy can be instituted, the greater the likelihood of preserving
neurological function. A therapy that could be rapidly deployed in all stroke patients to preserve the brain could
provide enormous potential benefit to stroke patients.
NanO2TM (aka dodecafluoropentane emulsion, DDFPe) significantly decreased stroke volume (SV), by about
85%, and improved neurological assessment score (NAS) in rabbits when administered IV up to 3 hours following
stroke and also improved SV and NAS in permanent rat MCAo. In a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase Ib/II
clinical trial of acute ischemic stroke, in which patients receive standard reperfusion therapy, NanO2 was safe at
all dose levels. The higher doses of NanO2 caused significantly better modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 30 and
90-days post stroke. Early administration of NanO2 (<5 hours from onset) presented with significantly better NIH
Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores. NanO2 is active at very low doses (e.g. 0.1 to 0.17 mL of 2% w/vol emulsion per
kg body weight) and clears via exhalation with a terminal half-life of about 90 minutes in humans. NanO2 was
previously tested as an ultrasound contrast agent in 2,230 patients and was considered safe and approvable by
the FDA and EMEA. The Specific Aims are 1) to manufacture DDFPe GMP for SPAN studies and to scale-up
GMP manufacturing, 2) to test drug in tMCAo models in lean, adult and aged Wistar rats and 3) to perform
studies in obese, diabetic Zucker rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats.
Expected Outcome: NanO2 will show great efficacy in rodent tMCAo models enabling this drug to be considered
as a candidate for entry into clinical trials in ischemic stroke sponsored by StrokeNet."

This proposal aims to provide crucial training for my long-term career plan to examine WNK1/OSR1 signaling
mechanisms contributing to neuronal metabolic alterations underlying the pathogenesis of age-related cognitive
impairment in dementia. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the leading age-related cause of dementia, characterized
by progressive cognitive decline and neuropsychiatric symptoms. New research in animal models suggest that
neuronal insulin resistance disrupts insulin signaling and glucose utilization by the hippocampal neurons that
regulate cognition and contribute to pathogenesis of diseases such as AD. Yet, the exact molecular mediators
regulating insulin signaling-mediated glucose uptake by the hippocampus and their roles in cognitive processes
remain to be fully elucidated. I propose to investigate the contributions of protein kinases WNK1/OSR1 in
hippocampal insulin signaling, sortilin-mediated glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4)-dependent glucose uptake and
cognitive function. Although With-No-lysine (K) 1 (WNK1) and its substrate Oxidative Stress Responsive 1
(OSR1) are implicated in multiple diseases exhibiting cognitive and psychiatric impairments, the underlying
mechanistic details involved are not known. My unpublished preliminary data highly suggest upregulated
hippocampal WNK/OSR1 in cognitive deterioration via inhibition of insulin/AKT signaling, OSR1/sortilin-
dependent GLUT4 trafficking and glucose uptake. My data also suggest negative WNK1-AKT crosstalk and
disruption of this intricately controlled WNK1-AKT axis predisposes mice to metabolic dysfunction, which is
reversed upon inhibition of WNK1 downstream signaling. Disruption of insulin/AKT signaling also underlies
cognitive dysfunction in insulin resistant states in an age-dependent manner. These findings point to chronically
enhanced hippocampal WNK1 signaling in the pathogenesis of cognitive deterioration in insulin resistant states
and aging. I will test these hypotheses in this proposal. For this, I will acquire crucial training in insulin signaling
pathways, neuroscience, behavioral physiology, and neuropathology during the K99 phase of this proposal to
complement my previous training in metabolic pathophysiology, biochemistry, WNK1/OSR1 kinase biology, cell
and molecular biology. I will be mentored by a leader in insulin signaling- Dr. Melanie Cobb, neuro-framework
underlying metabolism and behavior- Dr. Jeffrey Zigman, molecular basis of memory- Dr. Kimberly Huber,
synaptic trafficking- Dr. Ege T. Kavalali, aging and mechanisms of AD pathogenesis- Dr. Ilya Bezprozvanny.
This proposal harnesses the commitment of the Peter O’ Donnell Jr. Brain Institute, Department of Neuroscience,
Department of Pharmacology, Mouse Behavioral Core facility, and the overall scientific training environment of
a world-class research institution at UTSW. Establishing a unique skill set in insulin and WNK1/OSR1 signaling
pathway in addition to metabolism, neuroscience, behavioral physiology, and neuro-pathophysiology, will
support my transition to an independent research academic position and will lead to the discovery of molecular
mediators underlying neuronal metabolic disruption in age-related cognitive impairment in diseases such as AD."

The devastating impacts of early-childhood cranial and skull deformities affect nearly 25% of infants from
single pregnancies and 50% of those from multiple pregnancies. If not diagnosed early and treated effectively,
these abnormalities can impact brain development, leading to cognitive impairment, elevated intracranial
pressure, and motor disabilities. Clinicians’ capacity to effectively diagnose and treat these disorders is
hindered by two things: first, a limited understanding of how the cranium and brain normally grow and co-
develop; and, second, a dearth of imaging techniques that are sensitive enough to analyze joint cranial and
brain development in both healthy and abnormal instances. To address these limitations, a strong,
interdisciplinary, collaborative team from Children’s National Hospital, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, Brown
University, University of Colorado and Arizona State University proposes the current R01 aimed at developing
the first normative joint model of brain and cranium development before and after birth. This work is f ueled by
the team’s robust prior efforts, in which they independently collected large, normative datasets of computed
tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images of infants and fetuses, and implemented preliminary
tools to analyze them as a starting point for new methods to be developed as part of this project . The team’s
hypothesis is that the development of regional cortical and cranial morphologies will be strongly associated. It
will be tested using the following aims: (1) Develop quantitative imaging tools to model healthy cranial
development in infants; (2) Determine the joint development of cranial and cortical shape and thickness in
infants; (3) Develop a preliminary model of fetal brain and cranial growth across gestation; and (4) Build and
disseminate a user-friendly toolbox for clinicians and researchers.
 This project will be the ﬁrst systematic in-vivo study of joint healthy cranial and brain development before
and after birth. As such, it will determine typical variations of the cranial shape and their correlations with brain
parameters, adjusted for age and sex. The normative models generated here will serve as clinical resources
for matched comparisons in individual children with suspected disorders that involve abnormal cranial shapes.
Additionally, precise in-vivo quantitative imaging methods for assessing joint cranial and brain shape in inf ants
will be developed in this project and will serve as invaluable tools for physicians to better assess, diagnose,
and plan treatment for infant cranial deformities in the future."
10837036,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Dementia is typically diagnosed in late life, however, the disease process begins decades earlier; mid-life
experiences such as work are important modifiable predictors of Alzheimer's Disease and related disorders
(ADRD). Work is central to the lives of American adults, but the relationship between work, unemployment, and
ADRD across the lifecourse has been understudied. This proposal advances the current literature on how
occupations influence dementia risk in the United States in two ways: [1] people work from approximately ages
18 – 65, however little research evaluates age when someone has a particular job, job duration, or changes in
work experiences across working years; and [2] occupational classification systems used by population-based
datasets have changed to reflect the transition from a manufacturing to information and service based economy
(with different physical, environmental, and cognitive demands), however physical, environmental, and cognitive
characteristics of work have not been systematically applied to these shifting occupational classification systems.
In this proposal, we will evaluate lifecourse work trajectories and ADRD risk through novel applications of
sequence analysis, and construct a longitudinal database of physical, environmental, and cognitive demands of
work to catalyze research on lifecourse work trajectories and ADRD risk. We will leverage the strengths of three
large, longitudinal U.S. cohorts to evaluate the relationships between lifecourse work trajectories and ADRD risk:
The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 cohort (NLSY), the Panel Study of Income Dynamic (PSID),
and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Our research team has previously published using sequence
analysis, and previously used all three datasets, demonstrating the feasibility of our proposed project. Work is a
modifiable social risk factor that spans decades; a better understanding of work trajectories and features will
help identify employment interventions to slow cognitive decline and reduce ADRD disparities."

Nonsense mutations pose a serious challenge to fitness and survival of cells and organisms. To suppress
mRNAs carrying such nonsense mutations, all eukaryotes possess a conserved mRNA surveillance pathway
called Nonsense-Mediated mRNA Decay (NMD). NMD is also an essential post-transcriptional regulator of
normal mRNAs that shapes processes such as stem cell maintenance, neurogenesis, germ cell development
and anti-viral response. In all eukaryotes, NMD is governed by three UPF proteins, UPF1, UPF2 and UPF3. In
multicellular organisms, NMD is also regulated by a conserved multi-protein exon junction complex (EJC), which
binds upstream of mRNA exon-exon junctions. During translation, if at least one EJC remains present
downstream of a terminating ribosome, it can signal premature termination and trigger NMD. Understanding
NMD mechanism and its regulation by EJC is crucial for betterment of human health as mutations in EJC and
NMD proteins cause developmental defects, intellectual disability and mental retardation. The overarching goal
of this research program is to understand how the remarkable variation in composition and function of EJC/UPF
machinery regulates NMD to dictate cellular function and fate in animal cells. To achieve this goal, we are using
a combination of genetic, genomic, molecular, biochemical and cellular approaches in cultured human cells and
in zebrafish embryos to pursue four main directions. (1) We will identify the mechanism of a switch in EJC
composition that we recently discovered and define the role of distinct EJC compositions in gene expression. (2)
Our recent discovery that mammalian UPF3 paralogs and their interaction with EJC are non-essential for NMD
challenges a decades old model of EJC-dependent NMD in eukaryotes. We will apply new genomic technologies
that probe in vivo ribosome function to identify the role of UPF3 and other UPF proteins in premature termination
complex assembly and activity on hundreds of human mRNAs. We will also identify the factors and features that
govern signaling between the termination complex and the EJC. (3) We and others have previously shown that
EJCs are often detected at unexpected locations on RNAs. By exploiting a new step in EJC recycling that we
have uncovered, we will define the assembly mechanisms and functions of EJCs at such unexpected sites. (4)
We have developed zebrafish mutants that lack one of the EJC or its NMD adapter proteins, which will be used
to identify the genetic and cellular processes controlled by these factors during motor neuron and muscle
development. Overall, our work will advance the knowledge of NMD mechanisms and how they regulate post-
transcriptional gene regulation to control cellular function and organismal development. This progress will also
elevate our ability to target NMD for therapeutics."

Animal cells are asymmetric, often containing different proteins at distinct areas of the
membrane. For example, the cells that line our digestive tract are poised to take in nutrients
from one side of the cell and deliver them to the rest of the body at the other side. This proposal
examines the activity of the Par complex, a set of proteins responsible for creating and
maintaining different regions of animal cell membranes. We are also examining how cellular
asymmetries are translated into the complex organization seen in animal tissues and organs.
One mechanism for creating structure within tissues is to create different cell types, such as
neurons with the brain. In general, our work aims to understand how cells process information to
speciﬁcally target polarity and fate determinants to the appropriate region of the cell at the right
time, activate these complexes once they're localized, and how the activity of these complexes
is translated into complex cellular functions, such as differentiation."

Structural biology has a fundamental role to play in the advancement of cancer biology and the development of
cancer therapeutics. With the rapid developments in experimental structural determination (both crystallography
and cryo-EM spectroscopy), structure prediction methods (primarily AlphaFold2 and RosettaFold), and molecular
simulation methods, we are poised to bring new levels structural information to cancer research. In this project,
we will analyze the structural variation and dynamics of protein families commonly associated with cancer
development or targets of cancer therapeutics using existing clustering methods for protein loops and new
unsupervised learning techniques from the field of deep learning. We will develop methods for using AlphaFold2
to predict the structures of active and inactive kinases using templates based on our classification of active and
inactive states of kinases and multiple sequence alignments optimized for this task. In relevant cases, these
structure predictions will include the N and C terminal tails and other domains which may interact with the kinase
domains. We will integrate AlphaFold2 structure predictions of protein homo- and heterooligomeric complexes
with our database of common interfaces and assemblies found across the structures of proteins in the PDB.
Interactions observed in crystals that are replicated by AlphaFold2 present well-founded hypotheses for
functional protein interactions. This will be applied specifically for all human kinases where homodimer
interactions play an important role in activation and inhibition. We will continue our structural bioinformatics
studies of antibodies and expand this work to T-cell receptors, and investigate the utility of deep learning methods
for computational antibody and TCR design. Finally, we will bring new structure prediction technologies and our
statistical analysis of protein structures to the ongoing research programs of laboratory and clinical colleagues
at Fox Chase Cancer Center and Temple University School of Medicine."
10888144,"Project Summary/Abstract
RNA Silencing is a blanket term for a diverse group of biological processes in which small RNAs, including
PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) silence
genes. This proposal aims to leverage my group’s expertise in structural biology and biochemistry to
address outstanding questions that stand as roadblocks to advancing the current understanding of RNA
Silencing biology. Specifically: 1) piRNAs, essential for defending the genome against transposable
elements (TEs), have been studied extensively using molecular genetics, but how piRNA-associated
factors work together to produce the potent TE-silencing observed in animals remains unclear. We will
address this knowledge gap by discovering the structures and biochemical activities of RNA-protein
complexes central to piRNA function. 2) miRNAs are ubiquitous regulators of cellular gene expression in
mammals, but how miRNAs themselves are regulated has only recently come to light. We will advance
this emerging area by determining the structural basis for targeted ubiquitination and destruction of miRNA-
protein complexes by the recently discovered ZSWIM8 Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase. 3) Although the
canonical function of miRNAs is to silence targeted mRNAs, certain RNA viruses have evolved
mechanisms to repurpose cellular miRNAs to instead stabilize their viral genomes and stimulate viral
production. The mechanisms by which miRNA complexes are redirected to achieve these non-canonical
functions are poorly understood. We are addressing this knowledge gap by investigating interactions
between Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and the liver-specific miRNA miR-122, with a focus on understanding the
structures of miR-122–HCV RNA complexes that modulate HCV translation to enable replication of HCV
RNA. 4) One of the oldest and most intriguing mysteries of the RNA Silencing field is that, in some cases,
silencing RNAs readily pass between animal cells. 25 years after this discovery, the mechanisms for RNA
transport into animal cells remain unclear. We are addressing this shortcoming by determining the
structural basis for RNA recognition and transport by SID-1, a broadly conserved integral membrane
protein that transports double-stranded RNA into animal cells. The combined studies are expected to
produce insights necessary to overcome the major knowledge barriers described above, with implications
for understanding human health, fertility, viral infection, and the advancement of RNA-based therapies."
10833068,"Project Summary
 The central theme of this proposal is structural and mechanistic studies of nucleic acids, proteins, and
their interactions. The two broad topics that will serve as foci for our future research are: 1) the structure and
mechanism of topoisomerases, and 2) the structure and mechanism of non-coding RNA molecules, particularly
T-box riboswitches. The aim of our work is to discover and explore paradigms that help to illuminate the
structure and mechanism of biological molecules.
 Topoisomerases are ubiquitous proteins found across all three domains of life. They are involved in
several cellular processes and the importance of their cellular role is underscored by the fact that they are the
target of several cancer chemotherapeutic agents and antibiotics. The study of the structure, mechanism, and
function of topoisomerases not only furthers our understanding at many different levels of proteins that interact
with DNA and alter its topological properties, but also provides important information to aid in the design of
new therapeutic agents. We will continue our comprehensive studies of topoisomerases with an emphasis on
three large and complementary sub-projects: i) Single molecule studies of type IA topoisomerases, ii) Structural
studies of topoisomerases on natural substrates, and iii) Structural studies of gyrase in complex with mini-
circle DNA. These sub-projects will help answer crucial questions that are needed to advance the field to the next
level.
 Riboswitches are ligand-specific cis-regulatory RNA elements found in untranslated regions of mRNAs
that respond to defined external signals to affect transcription or translation of downstream genes. Bacterial T-
box riboswitches represent a unique class of riboswitches that do not bind small molecule ligands, instead they
recognize and bind tRNA molecules and sense directly their aminoacylation state. They represent an excellent
paradigm to understand RNA structure and architecture, recognition of RNA molecules by other RNA molecules,
RNA-based gene regulation, and the evolution of gene regulatory function from the ancient RNA world. We will
continue and expand our studies of T-box riboswitches by concentrating in three subprojects: i) Single molecule
studies of translational T-box riboswitches, ii) Structural and single molecule studies of typical T-box
riboswitches, and iii) Structural studies of tandem T-box riboswitches. These three sub-projects will advance
our understanding of T-box riboswitches and non-coding RNA molecules, molecules that are still not fully
understood at the atomic level."
10899438,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed studies address unresolved principal features of the adaptive immune system we have identified
in lampreys and hagfish. Instead of the immunoglobulin (Ig) domain-based system of all jawed vertebrates,
adaptive immunity in the jawless vertebrates is mediated by highly diverse sets of leucine-rich repeat (LRR)
proteins, named Variable LRR Receptors (VLRs). We have shown that three types of VLR in lampreys (VLRA,
VLRB and VLRC), while structurally unrelated to Ig and T cell receptors (TCRs), are nonetheless expressed by
cells with functional characteristics and gene expression profiles similar to those of mammalian B cells (VLRB),
αβT cells (VLRA), and γδT cells (VLRC). Here we will characterize the diversity of the agnathan T-like cells and
the structures of their VLR signaling complexes. Along with VLRA and VLRC cells, we will characterize two
novel VLRs that we recently identified, VLRD and VLRE, that are distantly related to VLRA and VLRC. We will
investigate the receptor diversity of VLRD and VLRE and the characteristics of subpopulations of lymphocytes
that express them. We have found orthologs of VLRD and VLRE in all six currently available lamprey genomes.
We will extend our phylogenetic survey of the presence and genomic organization of these new receptors to
more divergent lampreys and hagfishes. Like VLRA and VLRC, VLRD and VLRE are transmembrane proteins
with short cytoplasmic tails that lack recognizable signaling motifs. This implies the presence of VLR-associated
signaling molecules, as in jawed vertebrate TCR signaling. We will investigate the nature of signaling partners
in the composite VLRA/C/D/E receptors using pulldown/mass spectrometry strategies with our monoclonal
antibodies. We have identified transcripts for several candidate transmembrane proteins with ITAM motifs that
are expressed by VLRA+ and VLRC+ lymphocytes. We have also identified a sea lamprey ZAP70-like kinase
gene with preferential expression in the VLRA and VLRC T-like cells. We will use the sea lamprey ZAP70 tandem
SH2 domains as bait to identify potential interacting ITAM proteins from lysates of activated lamprey
lymphocytes. We will use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to delineate the subsets of T-like cells from
lamprey larval tissues. We will further characterize the early development of the T-like cells using CRISPR/Cas9
to mutate candidate regulators of VLRA/C/D/E assembly and signaling, followed by assessments of VLR
expression, repertoire diversity, and lymphocyte development. We will also characterize the emergence of T-
like lymphocytes in development with scRNA-seq analysis of cells isolated from early feeding larvae throughout
the onset of VLR assembly. These investigations will elucidate T-like cell function in a divergent branch of
vertebrate phylogeny. They will highlight common mechanisms of adaptive immunity across vertebrates, ancient
features that are retained in the agnathan lineage from a common vertebrate ancestor, and reveal novel
agnathan innovations. Collectively, these studies will contribute insight into the origins of vertebrate adaptive
immunity and provide a deeper understanding of T cell biology."
10899441,"Abstract
Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR)
which aims at restoring a healthy cellular proteome. Dysregulation of the UPR is key to diseases, e.g. neurodegeneration.
For this central role, the UPR forms a network of processes, involving complex transcription, translation, and RNA and
protein degradation changes. For example, while the UPR shuts down global translation, it activates specific response
genes, such as the transcription factor ATF4. Our goal is to investigate this response network.
We have investigated this network from several angles: profiling the dynamics of the mammalian UPR, we identified
regulatory signatures for hundreds of genes. We discovered a translation regulatory element in ATF4 whose role in
translation induction of the gene under stress had been overlooked. The element consists of a start and stop codon and
stalls ribosomes. We discovered start-stops in hundreds of genes enriched for signaling molecules. In addition, we profiled
protein modifications, e.g. ubiquitination, in response to stress. Further, we began to compare the UPR in two closely
related motor neurons with differential stress-sensitivity that is consistent with their role in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
(ALS): stress-sensitive spinal motor neurons die early during ALS, while more stress-resistant cranial motor neurons
survive until late stages of the disease. We identified molecular signatures, e.g. in the proteasome, that can explain the
motor neurons’ differential stress sensitivity. Doing so, we created tools and resources for integrative analysis.
In the next five years, we will address three major questions that arise from these findings: i) How does the cell, in
general, induce stress response genes while general translation is halted? ii) What are the roles of protein modifications in
the UPR? and iii) How do translation, protein modifications, and other pathways form an efficient and robust response
network that restores proteome health upon stress? Specifically, we will investigate the role of start-stops and other
elements in translation regulation of DROSHA and RAD23B, which function in the miRNA pathway and DNA damage
repair, respectively, but also link to the ER stress response. Using a gain-of-function construct, we will deconvolute the
mechanism of start-stop function and identify regulators of ribosome stalling that affect transcript localization, stability,
and downstream re-initiation. We will complement these analyses with large-scale assessment of ribosome scanning and
initiation, changes in transcript stability and in proteins bound to mRNAs in response to stress. A second research avenue
will investigate protein ufmylation, a ubiquitin-like protein modification linked to the UPR and ER maintenance, but also
to translation and the DNA damage response. We previously found that Ufl1, a key ufmylation gene, expresses different
isoforms in cranial and spinal motor neurons, and our proposed work will investigate the impact of differential Ufl1
expression on the UPR in the two motor neurons. Complementing these analyses, we will attempt to identify novel and
neuron type specific ufmylation targets and investigate their links to translation regulation, ribosome quality control, and
DNA damage repair. The work will exploit our expertise in systems-scale and targeted analysis to understand new
properties of the proteostasis network."

Synthesis, Structure, and Mechanism of Biorelevant Molecules and Reactions
 Our MIRA-supported research program encompasses synthetic, mechanistic, and structural organic chem-
istry. We address unresolved contemporary problems through studies that lead to i) new ways of deducing the
structures of novel chemical entities, often through innovative use of NMR methodologies, ii) new insights
about how chemical reactions, including spontaneous biosynthetic transformations, proceed, and iii) new ways
to make molecules that have structural features of interest to researchers pursuing targets with promising bio-
logical properties. We will capitalize on recent accomplishments and launch new efforts as follows.
 I. Natural Products Chemistry
 A. We remain interested in unraveling key steps in the biosynthesis of natural products that proceed in
the absence of enzymatic catalysis—that is, spontaneously. Two specific hypotheses related to the origin of
the unique skeleton of ottelione A drive current work: i) an unprecedented, low-barrier Cope rearrangement
fashions the strange, dearomatized 4-methylenecyclohexenone present in this secondary metabolite and ii) a
simple, achiral diarylheptanoid is oxidatively transformed into the strained and preorganized Cope substrate.
The engagement of an outstanding collaborator to use genome mapping approaches will be of great benefit.
 B. We frequently engage in natural product structure determination studies and the development of
methodologies of value to those who do the same. These studies have had impact extending well beyond the
specific questions that we address. Our record in doing this is strong. One notable example teaches methodol-
ogy for calculation of chemical shifts to the experimentalist who may be a novice computationalist. Our ap-
proach was the same as that used in the newest developments of probabilistic methods for comparison of
computed vs. experimental NMR chemical shifts to validate structure assignments (DP4, DP4+, DP4-AI, DP5).
We find a gap in that some communities have yet to embrace these approaches. We propose to evaluate the
effectiveness (and limitations) of these methods for structural assessment of various cyclic peptides and then
to communicate, advertise if you will, these outcomes to benefit future structural studies by peptide chemists.
 II. HDDA-Benzyne Chemistry
 Our discovery of the broad scope of the hexadehydro-Diels–Alder (HDDA) reaction is both exciting and en-
abling. This work has advanced significantly since the onset of our MIRA funding four years ago. The opportu-
nities in this arena show no sign of abating. To the contrary, it seems that every month or so a coworker arrives
at my doorstep with yet another new result that elicits from me something to the effect of “Wow, HDDA-
benzynes will also do that!” Myriad new directions are presented in pages 4–6 of the Research Strategy. Many
will lead to products containing a greater preponderance of heteroatoms, thereby demonstrating new ap-
proaches for consideration and use by researchers engaged in drug discovery activities.

Mental illness is a major public health concern in the United States and a significant source of morbidity and
mortality. The goal of the training program is to produce the next generation of researchers with rigorous
training in: health services research and economics, statistics and other methodologies, and implementation
science, all applied to mental health, and with an in-depth understanding of how health services and care
delivery and financing systems might optimally be designed to serve the needs of persons with mental illness.
Trainees will also have an understanding of the importance of producing knowledge to transform mental health
services and systems to promote equitable mental health services access, quality, and outcomes. This training
program capitalizes on the rich resources for mental health research at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
of Public Health (BSPH), the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and the University. Three pre-doctoral
trainees each year will obtain the skills and experiences needed to lead multi-disciplinary, collaborative
research teams. Pre-doctoral trainees undertake a rigorous program of coursework in the core domains of
public health and mental health including epidemiology, biostatistics, mental health services, psychopathology,
and research ethics. Each trainee will also obtain take additional coursework in the three braided threads of the
program: (1) health services and economics, (2) statistics and methodology, and (3) implementation science,
all with a cross-cutting focus on health equity. The braided threads build on strengths within BSPH and are
recognized as priorities highlighted in NIMH’s Research Priorities. All trainees also participate in a year-long
practicum experience, a bi-weekly seminar, ongoing mentored research projects, and yearly integrative
activities to complement their didactic curriculum. These components provide trainees with a solid
interdisciplinary foundation in mental health services and systems research. This training program is the first to
provide formal NIH-funded T32 pre-doctoral training in implementation science. The renewed program will
include 3 pre-doctoral students per year. These trainees will be supported by an experienced group of the 2
program directors, 15 additional core faculty and 13 affiliate faculty members with expertise in mental health
services research. The training program Co-Directors, Drs. Beth McGinty and Elizabeth Stuart are
accomplished scholars and national leaders in their research fields. A nationally recognized 9-member
Advisory Committee will provide high-level guidance. The training program is housed in the BSPH Department
of Health Policy and Management and run jointly with the Department of Mental Health, and has strong ties to
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. The overarching aim of the renewed program is to continue to identify and
train scholars who will become leaders in mental health services and systems research."
10792892,"SUMMARY – CORE C (CLINICAL CORE)
Core C (Clinical Core) will support the overall mVACS program goal to develop modified mRNA vaccines to
eliminate C.difficile infection (CDI) by developing an infrastructure for CDI human subject identification, specimen
biobanking, and metadata collection to study the stool microbial ecology and C. difficile-specific adaptive immune
responses in humans. Core C (Clinical Core) will lead enrollment of patients, acquisition, storage, and
processing of specimens and associated clinical data in a biorepository and manage the distribution to individual
projects. In addition, longitudinal clinical outcomes will be followed after sample collection. We propose the
following specific aims: (1) to establish a recurrent CDI biorepository and clinical database, capturing stool
samples and demographic data at the time of diagnosis, across a range of ages and comorbidities; (2) to develop
a longitudinal cohort of CDI subjects enrolled at first disease recurrence, for in parallel deep microbial and
immune profiling, with linkage to longitudinal clinical outcomes; and (3) to provide samples and clinical metadata
from the established biorepository and cohort to allow testing and validation of in vitro and animal model findings
from Project 1 (Vaccine Development), Project 2 (Antigen Discovery), and Project 3 (Immunology). Core
C (Clinical Core) will facilitate correlation of clinical features of rCDI and its outcomes with findings in Project 1
(Vaccine Development), Project 2 (Antigen Discovery), and Project 3 (Immunology), as well as the genomic
findings in Core B (Genomics Core) in order to identify and refine vaccine targets that may increase efficacy."
10792895,"SUMMARY- PROJECT 1 (VACCINE DEVELOPMENT)
Clostridioides difficile is a gram negative spore forming pathogen that causes mild to severe gastrointestinal
disorders and death in the elderly, immune compromised individuals and those exposed to systemic antibiotics.
Increased recurrence and difficulties treating the disease following antibiotic administration highlight the need to
develop novel therapeutic and prophylactic strategies. To date, vaccines against C. difficile demonstrated
promising results but failed to meet primary outcome criteria to mitigate/reduce primary infections. Therefore,
novel and innovative strategies/approaches are required. Our objective is to develop a clinically relevant
highly effective multivalent mRNA-LNP vaccine to prevent colonization and treat C. difficile infection.
Our strategy relies on our extensive experience with the nucleoside-modified mRNA and mRNA-LNP platforms,
large libraries of ionizable lipids, and a multipronged approach to vaccine development and novel target
discovery, as well as the unique multidisciplinary expertise and resources available to us. We hypothesize that
multivalent targeting of disease causing toxins and bacterial proteins (e.g., surface proteins) will 1)
mitigate primary infection in healthy individuals, and 2) prevent disease and promote decolonization in
infected individuals. Improving mucosal immunity following intramuscular administration of mRNA-LNP
through ligand and charge mediated tropism, oral delivery of mRNA-LNP vaccines capsulated in hydrogels
and/or the addition of immune modulators will improve the efficacy of the multivalent vaccine to decolonize C.
difficile in the gut lumen. Insight from the proposed multi-omic approach for target discovery (Project 2 and Core
B), and a better understanding of human immune responses to C difficile (Project 3 and Core C) will support a
translational workflow that leverages fundamental science and knowledge based approach for the discovery and
rational design of novel vaccine targets to treat and prevent C. difficile."
10739724,"Background: Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable disease in the U.S. Despite decades of
slowly declining cigarette use, many older adults still actively smoke. Among Veterans, 22% overall and 17% of
those over 50 years old actively smoked in 2015. It is notoriously difficult to quit, despite widespread
knowledge among adults about the health hazards of persistent smoking and a frequent desire to quit. Given
the prevalence and persistence of tobacco addiction, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)
recommends that health care professionals offer cessation interventions at every health care encounter.
Significance/Impact: The Teachable Moment to Opt-Out of Tobacco (TeaM OUT) intervention is specifically
designed to increase motivation to quit, reduce roadblocks, and increase access to smoking cessation
resources. It is especially focused connecting older active smokers not yet ready to quit to smoking cessation
services. TeaM OUT has the potential to result in more frequent and longer periods of abstinence from
smoking in this hard-to-reach population.
Innovation: TeaM OUT combines a teachable moment with an opt-out, proactive approach to connect patients
to existing cessation services using interactive voice response (IVR) technology. IVR is a proactive and
affordable way to reach more older active smokers more frequently.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: Among patients recently diagnosed with a pulmonary nodule, evaluate the
effectiveness of a proactive, teachable moment-based, smoking cessation outreach intervention (TeaM OUT)
on increasing engagement with smoking cessation resources compared to Enhanced Usual Care. Aim 2:
Evaluate the association of receipt of TeaM OUT with nicotine abstinence (seven-day point prevalence and
biochemically-measured) and quit motivation compared to Enhanced Usual Care. Aim 3: Qualitatively elicit
perspectives from key stakeholders to inform acceptability and utility, implementation barriers and facilitators,
and scalability of TeaM OUT.
Methodology: In aim 1, we use pulmonary nodule registries to identify participants from three VA facilities (VA
Portland, Minneapolis VA, Charleston VA). Patients with pulmonary nodules will be contacted after a stepped-
wedged randomization at the clinical level. Participants in the intervention arm are called by the IVR Quitline,
whereas participants the control arm must proactively choose to call the quitline. Options selected on the
quitline will be recorded and analyzed using logistic regression to test if the quitline increases engagement with
smoking cessation services. For aim 2, a subsample of participants in aim 1 will be contacted to complete
additional surveys for 56 weeks after nodule identification. We will measure nicotine abstinence, quit
motivation, and communication and analyze the measures using multivariable, multi-level hierarchical logistic
regression. In aim 3, we will qualitatively assess TeaM OUT by interviewing patient participants twice during
the study – first at the time of the initial Proactive IVR contact and second at 13 months after enrollment.
Clinical stakeholders will also be interviewed, with a focus on current and desired smoking cessations and
experiences with the TeaM OUT intervention. Codes will be derived without preconceived categories.
Next Steps/Implementation: We have purposely designed the intervention and overall study to maximize
generalizability, feasibility, adoption, and sustainability of the intervention. We plan multiple scientific
presentations and publications. Investigators will attend annual American Thoracic Society and HSRD
conferences to present the research findings. We will place all de-identified data in our IRB-approved Health
Services Research Repository (IRB #3535) at the conclusion of the study. We are creating a detailed toolkit as
part of the study's implementation process so that the IVR system can be easily replicated in multiple settings."
10761758,"Background: Between 40% to 60% of individuals with serious mental illness (SMI) are obese. Obesity and
physical inactivity result in increased rates of chronic diseases, increased risk of death, and substantial health
care costs. Treatment guidelines recommend that individuals with SMI who are overweight should be offered
evidence-based weight loss interventions, including psychosocial interventions. The VA’s weight management
program, MOVE!, is attended by less than 5% of the overweight population and is not adapted to the cognitive
needs and patient preferences for the population with SMI. Effective adapted weight management programs
are not offered in VA because they are time-intensive and require the skills of trained providers who are often
in short-supply. CoachToFit can address this gap in care. CoachToFit is a weight management program,
adapted for the population with SMI, that includes a smartphone app delivering evidence-based weight
management services with weekly telephonic support from a VA peer specialist who acts as a wellness coach.
Peer specialists are individuals who draw upon lived experiences with SMI to provide services to others with
SMI in clinical settings. CoachToFit was shown to have high rates of acceptability and usability and was
efficacious for weight loss in a small sample. VA has an opportunity to address obesity in the population with
serious mental illness, currently a substantial gap in care.
Significance/Impact: This project addresses obesity in the population with SMI by evaluating a weight
management program that is not only evidence-based, it is sustainable, transportable, appealing to patients,
easy to use, and minimally burdensome to the healthcare system. This effort addresses two HSR&D priority
areas: 1) Mental Health: Testing new models of care to improve access, cost, and/or outcomes, and 2) Health
Care Informatics: Building the evidence base for ehealth/mhealth tools.
Innovation: CoachToFit’s use of mobile technology is an important innovation in VA service delivery and its
user-centered design involving individuals with SMI was the first of its kind. CoachToFit is enhanced by data
visualization in real-time via a web-based dashboard used by VA peer specialists and their supervisor. We are
aware of no other evidence-based mobile platforms to help people with SMI reduce their weight.
Specific Aims: The project aims to 1) Test the efficacy of CoachToFit, compared to usual care, in decreasing
weight among Veterans with SMI who are obese; 2) Assess the hypothesized mechanisms of action for
CoachToFit, including self-efficacy, motivation, and readiness to change; and 3) Characterize factors that will
inform future implementation and maintenance of CoachToFit using a multi-stakeholder qualitative post-
intervention evaluation guided by the RE-AIM framework.
Methodology: The study design includes a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of CoachToFit and
assess the hypothesized mechanisms of action. This will include enrollment of obese Veterans with SMI from
the mental health clinics at one VA medical center (n=256). Individuals will be randomized to CoachToFit or
usual care. Those in CoachToFit will have access to the app and coaching for 6 months. Outcomes are assessed
at 6- and 12-months. Efficacy outcomes utilize objective measures. The design also includes a multi-
stakeholder qualitative post-intervention evaluation guided by the RE-AIM framework to characterize factors
that will inform future implementation and maintenance of CoachToFit. This will include interviews with
Veterans randomized to CoachToFit (n=30); interviews with staff stakeholders (n=18); a discussion with
Veterans in local Veteran groups (n=2 groups; n=11 Veterans), and interviews with national leadership (n=3).
Next Steps/Implementation: If CoachToFit is found to be efficacious, the VA National Center for Health
Promotion and Disease Prevention, along with input from national leadership in Peer Support Services and
Mental Health Informatics, will assist in integration into the VA context."
10841509,"Chromosomal double strand breaks (DSBs) are cytotoxic lesions that occur spontaneously during normal cell
metabolism or following treatment of cells with DNA-damaging agents. If unrepaired or repaired inappropriately,
DSBs can lead to profoundly detrimental events, such as chromosome loss, deletions, or translocations. Defects
in the repair of DSBs cause genomic instability, manifested as immunological, development or neurological
defects, and predisposition to cancer. The toxicity of DSBs is exploited for radiation and chemotherapy, as well
as targeted therapies directed against specific DNA repair proteins. Thus, understanding the mechanisms of
DSB repair is of fundamental importance and has practical application for development of new therapeutics and
uncovering pathways to resistance. Homologous recombination (HR), one of the two main mechanisms to repair
DSBs, employs extensive homology and templated DNA synthesis to restore the broken chromosome. In
addition to its role in repairing DSBs, HR has emerged as a prominent mechanism to restart stalled or collapsed
replication forks. The overall goal of our research program is to decipher the mechanisms of homology dependent
DSB repair, using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. The first part of our program builds
on our previous studies showing that the conserved Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex initiates end resection,
the first step of HR, while more extensive processing of the 5 terminated strands is catalyzed by Exo1 or Dna2-
Sgs1. Specifically, we will use S1-seq and MNase-seq methodologies to determine whether chromatin
remodeling precedes or is coupled to end resection, and will determine which resection mechanisms are
impacted by loss of RSC, SNF, INO80 and Fun30 chromatin remodelers. The second part of our program
focuses on the repair single-end DSBs produced by collapse of replication forks. We recently developed an
efficient system to create a site-specific replication fork collapse using Cas9 nickase and have shown that cell
survival is completely dependent on the MRX complex and Rad51. This system will allow us to define the elusive
functions of MRX in sister-chromatid recombination and to identify novel factors that participate in collapsed fork
repair. In the long term we believe that mechanisms under investigation in this proposal will provide new insight
into genomic instability caused by replication stress and how chromatin structure modulates DSB repair."
10823332,"Effects of macromolecular crowding on DNA mechanics, topology, transcription, and condensation
ABSTRACT
Macromolecular crowding (MMC) changes the concentration and affinities of intracellular biomolecules and
promotes liquid phase separation. MMC has been shown to change the melting temperature of DNA oligos, but
broad characterization of how it affects the mechanical stability of DNA is incomplete. Crowded DNA
condensates may generate sub-piconewton retractile tension on DNA, which can be conveniently explored using
magnetic/optical tweezers. While many experiments on DNA motors employ tensions opposing or assisting
translocation of several to tens of pN, our group showed that sub-piconewton tension affects DNA topology, from
supercoiling to protein-mediated looping, as well as the probability that an elongating E. coli RNA polymerase
(RNAP) surpasses a protein roadblock. Surprisingly, the effect of MMC on topologies such as supercoiling and
protein-mediated loops, and processes such as transcription, protein spreading, and condensation has not been
well characterized. This proposal aims to assess the effects of MMC on DNA configurations including unwinding
and looping, protein spreading, and liquid phase separation to integrate these features into our understanding
of intracellular molecular biology. To do so, we integrate single-molecule, in vitro experiments with in vivo
measurements and computational/theoretical approaches
Over the next five years, we will analyze both model and/or novel systems with single-molecule techniques to
learn how MMC changes DNA structure, affects protein-mediated looping, and alters transcription. We will also
investigate how MMC influences ParB-mediated spreading along DNA and liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)
which requires crowding agents in vitro. Then we propose to build artificial LLPS systems with which to learn
what components are required to localize a liquid-liquid phase separated droplet on a DNA segment. P-granules,
Cajal bodies, segrosome, and the nucleolus are some examples of LLPS that include specific genomic regions
and demonstrate the ubiquity and importance of this phenomenon. Macromolecular crowding generates forces
that affect fundamental DNA mechanics and topology and in the last decade MMC has emerged as a driver of
LLPS. We will integrate in vitro experiments with computational and theoretical approaches and compare with
appropriate in vivo measurements performed by a collaborator. Discovering the mechanisms by which crowding
modifies DNA configurations, transactions, and segregation will advance our understanding of genome
biophysics and regulation and provide new tools for synthetic biology."
10827907,"Project Summary
Telomeres ensure genome integrity by facilitating chromosome end replication through
telomerase, the activity of which enables cellular proliferation. Uncontrolled proliferation as may
occur in cancer cells requires hyper-activation of telomere-extension activity. Conversely, lack of
telomere extension results in degenerative disorders or premature aging. Critical to telomere
structure and function, the conserved multifunctional shelterin complex associates with
telomeres to coordinate multiple telomere activities. The long-term objective of our NIGMS
MIRA research program is to determine, at the atomic resolution, molecular mechanisms of
telomere length homeostasis through comprehensive biochemical, structural, and functional
characterizations of the telomeric shelterin complex, shelterin-telomerase interactions, and
telomerase biogenesis. Mutations in telomerase subunits or shelterin components have been
increasingly linked to cancer and premature aging. Shelterin complex and shelterin-telomerase
interactions play essential roles in regulating synthesis of telomeric DNA repeats and defining
telomere lengths that support or restrict cell proliferation. Our recent efforts have achieved the
conceptual advancement on the role of shelterin bridge, rather than individual shelterin
component per se, in regulating telomere length and the landmark determination of the atomic
views of shelterin bridge assembly process by x-ray crystallography. Our accumulated
expertise and prior success position us to deepen our investigations. In the next five years, we
aim to address the following three fundamental questions in the field: 1) Elucidate the

its role in telomere length control; 2) Determine the mechanistic basis of shelterin disassembly;
3) Determine the structural basis of telomerase RNA folding quality control mechanism by Pof8

One central paradox in the initiation of allergic immunity is that although dendritic cells are necessary for the
initiation of allergic immune responses, dendritic cells are activated in vivo by allergen immunization, but not
directly in vitro by allergens. This indicates that another cell may act upstream of dendritic cells to act as the
initial allergen sensor. Our long-term goal is to understand how the innate immune system is activated by
allergens to initiate the allergic immune response. Given that 40% of the United States population suffers from
one or more allergic diseases and that the prevalence of allergic disease continues to increase worldwide, we
believe there is an urgent health need to understand how allergic diseases are initiated. We recently found that
sensory neurons are directly activated by allergens in vivo and in vitro, leading to the release of Substance P
that activates the migration of Th2-skewing dendritic cells through their expression of MRPGPRA1. Our central
hypothesis is that sensory neurons are the initial sensors of allergens and that their interactions with innate
immune cells both promote sensory neuronal responsiveness to allergens and allows sensory neurons to
initiate the allergic immune response. Building upon recent breakthroughs detailing sensory neurons involved
in allergen sensing, dendritic cell subsets that respond to allergens, and mechanisms of allergic-skewing
dendritic cell migration, we propose to integrate tools of cellular immunology and neurobiology to gain a
fundamental understanding of neuroimmune interactions that promote allergic immune activation. Using these
tools, we propose to test our central hypothesis in two specific aims: (1) determine the mechanisms by which
allergen-stimulated sensory neurons interact with and initiate dendritic cell activation, and (2) identify how  T
cells control sensory neuron activation by allergens. Aim 1 will examine the interactions between sensory
neurons and dendritic cells, and the requirement for Substance P and MRGPRA1 in these interactions. Aim 2
will address how a novel subset of dermal  T cells may endow or promote the responsiveness of sensory
neurons to allergens. These studies will lay the groundwork for the development of therapeutic strategies to
prevent initial allergic sensitization (Aim 1), treat chronic itch diseases (Aim 2), and prevent polysensitization in
patients with pre-existing allergic disease (Aims 1 & 2)."

The common marmoset provides a very relevant primate model for understanding the organization of the human
nervous system and the diseases that affect it. Like humans, marmosets also demonstrate cooperative social
behavior and have advanced cognitive processes, making them of great interest in the field for modeling
developmental and psychiatric diseases and their therapies. They are also ideal for multigenerational genetic
experiments as they give birth twice a year and mature faster than most primates. However, while the
CRISPR/Cas9 system has been used to knockout genes and create knock-ins of single amino acids in a heritable
manner in marmosets, it has been a challenge in the field to create germline transmissible models of gene
reporters and trinucleotide repeat genes analogous to their murine counterparts. The very low efficiency of
homologous recombination (HR) in primates has precluded knocking-in coding sequences by simply injecting
Cas9 protein and a guide RNA into embryos during in vitro fertilization (IVF) as is done for creating knockouts.
This limitation has prevented modelling of more genetically complex neurological diseases such as Huntington’s
disease (HD) and for creating conditional reporters in marmosets, both of which are mainstays in the mouse
neurogenetics field. In addition to low HR frequency, other barriers to creating germline transmission of knock-
ins include the absence of a well annotated marmoset genome until recently, lack of protocols for derivation of
ground state marmoset pluripotent stem cells (cjPSCs), the low percentage of marmoset pregnancies after
embryo reimplantation, and a general deficiency of developmental biology expertise in the marmoset field. We
propose to harness our labs’ expertise in developmental biology, IVF technologies, and transgenic stem cell
biology to overcome this barrier to widespread use of marmosets. We aim to create transgenic knock-in cjPSCs,
convert them into ground-state pluripotent stem cells and then inject them into IVF morula to create a chimeric
founder marmoset that carries the modified genome. We then aim to screen the transgenic gametes from the
founder marmosets to create the F1 progeny and use them to correlate the molecular-behavioral phenotype of
HD. As proof-of-principle, we will focus on three knock-in reporter lines to broadly target excitatory, inhibitory,
and peripheral neuronal populations. Together, if successful, our aims will result in creation of the first primate
model with neuron-specific reporters, establish the marmoset as a valid model of HD, enable access to single-
cell transcriptomic changes at the early stages of HD in a primate disease model, and finally correlate these
molecular changes with the behavioral phenotype. These aims will provide fundamental insights into the biology
of HD and the role of huntingtin protein in different classes of neurons. The outcome of this project will also
influence a better understanding of poly-glutamine neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans. In addition,
the transgenic marmosets that we generate will be broadly available to the research community and enable new
studies into neural circuits, development, behavior, and a wide range of optogenetic applications."

 Towards Early Detection of Alzheimer’s Disease
PROJECT SUMMARY.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) poses a growing burden on our society, with cases expected to reach 12.7 million
by 2050. While research supports biomarkers for early detection, most Alzheimer’s patients are diagnosed
after exhibiting clinical symptoms. At this stage, the advanced progression of senile plaques and
neurofibrillary tangles pose significant challenges to effective interventions. Moreover, established
biomarkers, such as amyloid beta-42/amyloid beta-40 and phosphorylated tau, are currently limited to
analysis in cerebrospinal fluid, making their potential for routine screening nearly impossible. Thus, there is
a critical need for novel, non-invasive approaches to rapidly screen for preclinical Alzheimer’s to facilitate
the application of early interventions, such as physical, pharmaceutical, and cognitive therapies. Recent
work has demonstrated the potential of circulating extracellular vesicles as a promising source of biomarkers
to monitor and diagnose various diseases, including AD. However, accessible technologies to accurately
detect AD-associated extracellular vesicles and their constituents are not currently in clinical practice.
Moreover, concentrations in blood are present in the low pico- to femtomolar range, limiting conventional
detection by ELISA and Western blot. This proposal aims to address these critical needs and focuses on
developing a new platform to detect tau in neuron-derived extracellular vesicles (NDEVs). We hypothesize
that ultrasensitive detection (< 5 pg/mL) of NDEV-tau can be achieved by optimizing our surface-enhanced
Raman spectroscopy (SERS) nanotag technology using a rational design-of-experiment approach. If our
hypothesis is correct, we expect this work to serve as the foundation for developing a point-of-care device
that can be used for routine screening of pre-symptomatic AD. With this goal in mind, we will focus on the
following specific aims: (1) Synthesize ‘SERS nanotags’ with a high affinity for NDEV-tau and identify the
characteristics for effective binding; (2) Assess NDEV-tau sensitivity and specificity using the SERS platform
in spiked human serum. Ultimately, we expect to establish the limit of detection and sample volumes needed
for accurate tau detection. By engineering SERS-active substrates for ultrasensitive detection of NDEV-tau,
we can then build upon this platform to enhance the multiplexing of several AD-associated biomarkers in
complex biological samples. Our long-term goal is to develop SERS-based bioanalysis to drastically
improve current standards in molecular detection for AD in both clinical and research settings."

 The endocrine hormone estrogen (E2) actions by binding to its estrogen-receptor alpha (ERα), stimulates
a robust mitogenic response in ER+ cells. In this regard, signal-regulated divergent transcription and its products
have emerged as an important class of molecules that regulate various endocrine pathways such as estrogen
and androgen signaling. Recent studies suggest that divergent transcripts are cell- and tissue-specifically
expressed, and the E2-regulated divergent transcription is critical to eliciting full E2-driven gene expression. E2
signaling triggers a highly coordinated transcriptional program, leading to a robust mitogenic response that drives
different cellular activities. Understanding the molecular mechanisms through which divergent transcription or
transcripts regulate E2-responsive, ERα-dependent transcription will increase our understanding of the diseases
caused by aberrant E2-signaling. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms of action of divergent transcripts in
ER+ cells will be very important. In the preliminary study involving cellular and genomic approaches, E2-
regulated divergent RNAs were identified and annotated. In addition, the initial characterization of a novel E2-
regulated divergent transcript suggests that it controls E2-driven cellular processes and gene expression. In the
current proposal, the molecular mechanisms by which divergent transcripts regulate E2-dependent signaling will
be determined. The overarching hypothesis is that specific biochemical and structural properties of divergent
transcripts underlie their ability to control critical E2-dependent pathways. A complementary set of biochemical,
molecular, cell-based, proteomic, and genomic assays will be used to study the molecular mechanisms by which
divergent transcript regulates E2-dependent transcription and growth of ER+ cells: specifically (1) Aim 1 will
determine the molecular mechanisms of action of E2-regulated divergent transcript, in E2-dependent signaling,
and (2) Aim 2 will identify the mechanism by which divergent transcripts control the assembly of E2-dependent
gene regulatory complex. Successful completion of these aims will yield a new understanding of how divergent
transcripts control key E2-dependent cellular pathways."
10898573,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PROJECT 3
PDAC is among the most deadly malignant solid tumors, with approximately 92% of patients succumbing to the
disease within five years of diagnosis, and with no effective therapies beyond surgery. Importantly, it is widely
recognized that patients with PDAC are especially prone to cachexia, a syndrome characterized by pronounced
weight loss due to depleting skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. As a result, patients are often weak and
fatigued, which makes them less tolerant to chemo- and radiotherapy. The histopathological hallmark of PDAC
is its uniquely dense stromal reaction, comprised of activated, cancer associated fibroblasts, increased extra-
cellular matrix (ECM), immune cell infiltrates, and abnormal angiogenesis. This has engendered attention for
selectively targeting the tumor stroma to increase therapeutic efficacy. However, stromal cancer-associated
fibroblasts can also have tumor suppressive functions, challenging the efficacy of stromal-targeting therapies. In
addition, there is increasing appreciation for the dual role of stromal mesenchymal cells in muscle homeostasis
and regeneration, as well as in muscle wasting diseases, including cancer cachexia. Progress in tackling PDAC
will require new knowledge of its macroenvironment encompassing crosstalk between the tumor and peripheral
tissues. In Project 3, we posit the IL6/STAT3 pathway is a key pathway involved in PDAC macroenvironment
cross-talk. Synergistic interactions with the Projects and Cores in this Program Project will allow us to test the
hypothesis that STAT3 signaling in stromal mesenchymal cells present in the tumor and muscle is a component
of a feed-forward loop in the tumor macroenvironment that favors PDAC progression and cancer cachexia."
10867503,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PROJECT 1
Evidence-based prevention, treatment, and recovery services for substance use disorders (SUDs) and HIV
often fail to be implemented or sustained due to barriers at multiple levels, such as lack of time and skills at the
practitioner level; lack of support or established processes at the clinic level; or lack of effective technological
tools, financing, and policies at the system level. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a new
generation of effective, replicable multi-level strategies for implementing evidence-based SUD/HIV services in
real-world settings, thus improving the outcomes of individuals with or at risk for SUD or HIV. To achieve this
long-term goal, we will: (Aim 1) Develop principles for the design of Multi-level Adaptive Implementation
Strategies (MAISYs) to guide how best to adapt (e.g., augment, intensify) implementation strategies based on
the context and needs at multiple levels (e.g., clinic, practitioner); and develop a new experimental design—the
Multi-level Implementation Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trial (MI-SMART), in which
sequences of randomizations occur at multiple levels—to inform the construction of optimized MAISYs; (Aim 2)
Develop new data analysis methods for use with longitudinal data in an MI-SMART to address a suite of
questions about the construction of a MAISY; (Aim 3) Develop sample size calculators for MI-SMARTs to
enable SUD/HIV implementation scientists to plan and calculate statistical power for different types of MI-
SMART designs; and (Aim 4) Work with the Dissemination and Training Core to disseminate the developed
methods so that they can be readily applied by SUD/HIV scientists. This includes the development of webinars,
workshops, tutorials, and free, user-friendly software for SUD/HIV scientists."
10867507,"PROJECT SUMMARY: PROJECT 2
Advances in digital technologies (e.g., electronic health records, telehealth, and mobile health technologies)
have created unprecedented opportunities to extend the reach and impact of adaptive services for individuals
with or at risk for substance use disorders (SUD) and HIV. While services delivered by automated software
tools, such as digital just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), are relatively inexpensive and can deliver
support in the moment, insufficient engagement remains a major barrier. Human delivery of services can be
more engaging but often more expensive and burdensome. Hence, the integration of digital and human-
delivered services requires a trade-off between benefits and drawbacks that necessitates balancing
effectiveness against scalability and sustainability. Understanding how to best leverage digital and human
modalities to deliver adaptive interventions is critical for building effective and scalable SUD/HIV services. A
major challenge is determining how best to use data to optimize the integration between intervention
components that are human-delivered with a low intensity of adaptation (e.g., weekly, monthly) and those that
are digitally delivered with a high intensity of adaptation (e.g., every minute or day). The long-term goal of the
proposed project is to enable scientists to optimize Multimodality Adaptive Interventions (MADIs), in which both
human-delivered and digital components are sequenced and adapted over time, at different time scales. To
achieve this long-term goal, we will: (Aim 1) Develop a new, flexible trial design in which individuals can be
randomized simultaneously to human-delivered and digital interventions at different time scales; (Aim 2)
Develop new statistical methods for use with data from the new experimental design to address novel
questions about synergies between human-delivered and digital services; (Aim 3) Develop sample size
calculators to enable SUD/HIV scientists to plan novel experimental studies to address these questions; and
(Aim 4) Place these methods directly into the hands of SUD/HIV scientists so that they can be readily applied
to advance SUD/HIV prevention, treatment, and recovery services. We will conduct workshops for SUD/HIV
scientists and publish both tutorials and applications in drug-use, HIV, and methodology outlets. We will work
with the Dissemination and Training Core to develop free, user-friendly software that will enable SUD/HIV
scientists to employ the new method in their own work. This project will provide the scaffolding to support
evidence-driven integration and adaptation of human-delivered and digital services, accelerating a new
generation of effective and scalable SUD/HIV interventions."

About 25-50% of women who undergo breast cancer surgery develop persistent chest wall pain
and shoulder mobility limitations following surgery. The pain and mobility limitations adversely
affect quality of life, sleep, and body image. Unfortunately, current treatments for pain and
mobility limitations have variable efficacy. Based on a review of relevant pre-, intra-, and post-
operative factors, we reasoned that myofascial massage may address contributors to pain and
mobility limitations following breast cancer surgery. Myofascial massage is a deep tissue
massage that focuses on muscles as well as the connective tissue that surrounds muscles,
bones, and ligaments. We subsequently conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial involving
21 women with persistent pain and mobility limitations many months after surgery. We found
that women who received myofascial massage to the affected breast/chest/shoulder had
marked reductions in pain and mobility limitations and significant improvements in quality of life
compared to a control group who received relaxation massage. We also established a practice-
based research network of 63 northeast Ohio massage therapists to guide future work.
We now propose a full scale randomized controlled trial involving 202 women with persistent
pain and mobility limitations. To help differentiate between the specific effects of myofascial
massage and non-specific effects due to prolonged touch and attention from a massage
therapist, we will include an active control group that will receive light touch. Participants in
each group will receive 30 minutes of treatment twice weekly for 2 months. Primary analyses
will determine the impact of myofascial massage on pain and mobility limitations. Secondary
analyses will examine the impact of myofascial massage on a number of secondary outcomes,
including range of motion, quality of life, sleep, and body image.
Innovative features of the proposed project include a rigorous randomized controlled trial
design, inclusion of an active control group, direct targeting of the affected
breast/chest/shoulder, assessment of multiple mechanistic and patient-centered outcomes, and
involvement of a massage practice-based research network. We anticipate that the project will
lead to a new and effective approach for addressing a major source of morbidity for women with
breast cancer. Furthermore, the project may serve as a model for future trials of manual
therapy among individuals with chronic medical conditions."
10891368,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Patients with digestive tract malignancy often experience severe and unremitting abdominal pain that
negatively affects physical, emotional, and social function, as well as health related quality of life (HRQOL).
Despite the substantial burden of visceral cancer pain, available therapies are limited in their ability to offer safe
and effective analgesia. Patients frequently turn to opioids when other treatments fail to provide adequate
analgesia, yet often discover that opioids also fall short in delivering meaningful pain reduction or improving
HRQOL. For those who do achieve effective analgesia from opioids, they nonetheless assume a substantial risk
of opioid-related morbidity and mortality. Further, in many cases, opioids impair bowel function and can worsen—
not alleviate—abdominal pain. Hence, there is a critical gap in managing visceral pain from digestive tract
malignancies; it is vital to address this evidence gap in a way that maximizes benefits for patients while
minimizing the risk of harm.
 Therapeutic virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a promising and evidence-based treatment modality for
cancer pain. Users of VR wear a pair of goggles with a close-proximity screen in front of the eyes that creates a
sensation of being transported into lifelike, three-dimensional worlds. To date, VR has been limited to short-term
clinical trials for cancer pain. Moreover, limited research exists on theory-based VR modalities beyond mere
distraction, such as VR that employs acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) with components of
biofeedback and mindfulness. To bridge these gaps, this study seeks to: (1) assess the impact of immersive VR
on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including pain, activity metrics, and opioid use among patients with
visceral pain from a digestive tract malignancy; (2) assess differences in PROs, activity metrics, and opioid use
between skills-based VR therapy vs. distraction VR therapy; and (3) determine patient-level predictors of VR
treatment response in visceral cancer pain.
 To address these aims, the study will measure PROs and opioid use in 360 patients randomized among 3
groups and follow them for 60 days after enrollment: (1) an enhanced VR group receiving skills-based VR; (2) a
distraction-based VR group receiving patient-selected VR videos; and (3) a VR sham control group using a VR
headset with 2-D content. The results will inform best practices for the implementation of VR for visceral cancer
pain management and guide selection of patient-tailored experiences."

for the expansion of the program to now include four predoctoral trainees. The predoctoral trainees will be
from four departments with strong alcohol research, psychology, community health and health behavior, social
work, and pharmacology/toxicology. In addition to these disciplines, faculty also include representation of such
diverse yet complementary fields such as sociology, epidemiology, psychiatry, nursing, and the
psychobiological sciences (clinical neuroscience, applied biopsychology, behavioral neuroscience). Research
training is conducted within the mentor's research program, as specified within Individual Training Programs
(ITP) approved and monitored by the Steering Committee. With this diverse faculty, we are able to provide
trainees with a broad, yet deep, foundation of knowledge regarding the biological, psychological, and social
aspects of alcohol use and alcohol use disorders. The core curriculum includes: 1) a one credit (CHB 620—
Special Topics) course each semester. The course includes seminars (e.g., Foundations of Interdisciplinary
Alcohol Research, Seminal Articles in Alcohol studies), grant writing workshops, statistics workshops,
professional development, and Training in the Responsible Conduct of Research. All of these seminars and
workshops will rotate throughout the training to ensure that each trainee will have a chance to participate in all
of the programming; 2) CRIA's seminar series and 3) formal didactic coursework identified in the ITP as
important for research career progress. In addition to the core curriculum, there are a number of supplemental
training opportunities, particularly through the Clinical and Translational Science Institute. In the past 15 years,

10772075,"Project Summary
Almost all tissues acquire spontaneous somatic mutations that can result in subsequent clonal expansion. Such
clonal expansions are readily observable in peripheral blood samples as a patient’s age increases. This
phenomenon, referred to as clonal hematopoiesis (CH), increases an individual’s risk for hematologic
malignancies and cardiovascular disease, and has a prevalence over 10% in patients over the age of 65.
Amongst the more frequently mutated genes in CH, as well as in subsequent malignancies such as acute myeloid
leukemia (AML), are genes associated with DNA methylation, such as DNMT3A. However, the process through
which clonal hematopoiesis occurs and gives rise to these diseases is unknown. This project seeks to uncover
the biological impacts of these somatic mutations on hematopoiesis, which allow hematologic cells to transform
into malignancies and impact cardiovascular health. Specifically, this project aims to characterize the effects of
DNMT3A mutations on gene transcription, DNA methylation, and chromatin accessibility, to provide insight into
the progression from clonal hematopoiesis to disease.
The main approach in this proposal centers around single-cell sequencing along with genotyping of individual
cells. In Specific Aim 1, I will use our lab’s recently developed Genotyping of Transcriptomes method to compare
the transcriptional landscape of wild-type and mutant hematopoietic progenitor cells. This will provide insight into
differentiation fate skews as well as changes in gene expression associated with the somatic mutations. In
Specific Aim 2, I will use similar methods developed in our lab to combine single-cell methylome and chromatin
accessibility profiling with somatic genotyping in order to identify putative mechanisms that could explain the
changes in transcription and cell-fate determination. The outcomes of this study will inform the pathogenesis of
normal hematopoiesis to CH to malignancy, providing useful insights into the role of screening for CH as well as
possible therapeutic options to prevent the progression of disease. This project will be ideal for an aspiring
physician-scientist in training, given its blend of novel sequencing technologies applied to clinical samples
analyzed using cutting-edge computational biological methods, along with its possible implications for clinical
recommendations. With the mentorship of my sponsor, co-sponsor, thesis committee, leadership of the Tri-I MD-
PhD program, and the support of this fellowship, I am confident I will be well prepared to pursue and achieve my
goal of being a physician scientist and independent investigator."

10881684,"The mission of my Neuroimmunology Research Program is to develop a deep biological understanding of
autoimmune, demyelinating and neurodegenerative processes that affect the central nervous system (CNS)
and to identify and test novel disease-relevant therapies that can be brought to market to treat and/or cure
these conditions. Veterans are currently developing intractable chronic neurological diseases such as multiple
sclerosis (MS) and stroke, service related injuries including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), and substance abuse of alcohol and methamphetamine. Studies carried out by our
laboratory are highly relevant to these devastating conditions due to our development of a novel therapy that
targets a common underlying mechanism, the MIF/CD74 axis that promotes chronic inflammation in the CNS
and other tissues. MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor) and its homolog D-DT (D-dopachrome
tautomerase) are highly inflammatory cytokines that trigger release of other inflammatory factors upon binding
and signaling through their common receptor, CD74, a chaperone for loading self and foreign peptides into
MHC class II molecules on antigen presenting cells (APC). The result of MIF/CD74 signaling is peptide-specific
Teffector cell activation and recruitment of inflammatory cells from blood into the CNS. Our initial unique
therapeutic construct, called RTL1000 is comprised of linked DRα1 and DRβ1 domains of HLA-DR2 (an MS
risk factor) covalently linked to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35-55. This construct has
conformational similarity to naturally occurring MHC class II/peptide T cell receptor ligands, but induces T cell
tolerance when present in soluble form without cell-bound co-stimulatory molecules on APC. This construct
has immunoregulatory and neuroprotective properties in a mouse model of MS (experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis, EAE) and was shown to be safe and well tolerated in a Phase 1 study in MS. RTL1000 will
soon be tested in a multi-dose MS clinical trial. The major breakthrough in understanding the potent effects of
RTL1000 occurred in 2013 with the discovery of CD74 as the cellular receptor for RTL1000. This led to the
unifying discovery that RTL1000 could competitively inhibit binding of both MIF and D-DT to CD74 and thus
short-circuit MIF/CD74 signaling that is present in essentially all of the VA targeted CNS conditions. Molecular
modeling of MIF binding revealed two discrete CD74 regions that bound to homologous sequences on MIF and
D-DT and to the DRα1 moiety of RTL1000, thus explaining RTL1000’s competitive inhibition. However,
RTL1000 can only be used in ~60% of MS subjects that express HLA-DR2. We thus designed a new
construct, DRα1-MOG-35-55 that retained the activities of RTL1000 and could modulate CD74 and
competitively block MIF binding, resulting in a significant treatment effect and neuroprotection in chronic EAE.
Of interest, RTL1000 and DRα1-MOG-35-55 were more effective in treating chronic EAE in male mice due to
an antagonist effect of estrogen receptor (ESR1) in females. An evaluation of MIF, D-DT and CD74 in a ~600
subject clinical study (to be published in PNAS) revealed that male subjects with a high expression genotype
for MIF (and D-DT) had an increased risk of developing progressive MS. This unique observation raises the
possibility that early treatment of males with RTL1000 or DRα1-MOG-35-55 might prevent conversion to
progressive MS and potentially would be effective for treating MS subjects with progressive disease. FDA IND
approval of DRα1-MOG-35-55 preclinical studies would allow treatment of all MS subjects regardless of the
HLA type due to its non-polymorphic, universal expression that would be tolerated by all humans and thus
could be injected without tissue typing. Of broader importance, we have demonstrated that RTL1000 and
DRα1-MOG-35-55 constructs can also treat other CNS conditions in experimental mouse models including
experimental stroke, vascular dementia, traumatic brain injury and methamphetamine induced cognitive
disability, thus providing a novel potential therapy for Veterans that develop these devastating conditions."
10817683,"In many studies on the risk of disease, investigators analyze the spatial patterns of health outcomes and evaluate
residential environmental exposures at the time of study enrollment in hopes of identifying potential causal
environmental factors. However, for cancers with long latencies like bladder cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(NHL) residential locations many years prior to diagnosis are important for determining where and when relevant
environmental exposures occurred in mobile study populations. Many environmental factors are distributed
unevenly over space and time and several decades may have elapsed between exposure to a relevant risk factor
and diagnosis. While some investigators have begun to consider residential histories in studies of cancer, a
number of research challenges remain. Statistical methods are currently lacking for modeling cumulative spatial
risk of cancer over time using residential histories in epidemiologic studies. There is also a need for methods
that estimate environmental and socio-spatial exposure effects over time while modeling cumulative spatial risk.
Exposure data are increasingly becoming multivariate and there is a need to develop statistical methods for
handling multivariate exposures such as chemical mixtures over time. In the consideration of residential histories,
more investigators are proposing to use public record databases such as LexisNexis to acquire historic
residential locations for study subjects. However, it is currently unknown what impact using residential histories
from public record databases in place of subject-reported residential histories has when studying environmental
cancer risk over time. Measurement error and therefore bias could result from using public record databases
particularly going several decades back in time. In this project, we aim to develop a comprehensive set of
methods that incorporate residential histories into cancer studies to estimate both cumulative spatial risk and
health effects of many environmental and socio-spatial exposures over time. We will apply these methods to the
New England Bladder Cancer Study and the NCI-SEER NHL study to better understand environmental factors
for bladder cancer and NHL. We will also assess the impact of using residential histories from public record
databases on the ability of methods to identify spatial areas of risk and estimate environmental and socio-spatial
exposure effects. The expected outcomes of this research will be 1) new statistical methods for estimating
cumulative spatial risk and health effects for many environmental and socio-spatial exposures over time, and 2)
identification of areas of significantly elevated risk over time for bladder cancer and NHL risk, 3) estimates of
effects for mixtures of historic environmental and socio-spatial exposures and bladder cancer and NHL risk, and
4) an assessment of using residential histories from public record databases to estimate historic exposure effects
and detect areas of elevated cancer risk. The methodological approaches developed will be applicable to many
studies of cancer and environmental risk. In addition, the findings from the assessment of public record database
residential histories will be useful for many investigators considering using them in environmental risk studies."

(Ste20/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase and oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1) kinases regulate
activities of multiple ion transporters and play important roles in renal salt handling, maintenance of arterial tone,
and hypertension. Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1) is one of the major substrates of the WNK-
SPAK/OSR1 kinases. Stimulation of
the
WNK-SPAK kinases increased brain NKCC1 activity via protein
phosphorylation and led to ischemic cell damage through NKCC1-mediated Na+ and Cl- overload, cytotoxic
edema and excitotoxicity. In the initial funding period of BX002891 grant, we discovered that WNK-SPAK/OSR1
kinases are involved in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke-induced brain damages (JCB&M. 2017). We
concluded that augmented WNK-Cab39-NKCC1 signaling in hypertensive rats is associated with an increased
susceptibility to ischemic brain damage and presents as a novel target for anti-hypertensive and anti-ischemic
stroke therapy. We developed a novel WNK-SPAK inhibitor ZT-1a which shows robust neuroprotective activity
in animal models of ischemic stroke (Nature Communications 2020). Derived from this research, a patent
application (VA Invention Disclosure ID# 2018-313) “
Therapeutic application of ZT-1a and derivatives for brain
disorders”
has been filed via U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Assessing ZT-1a and its derivatives as novel
neuroprotective drugs for acute ischemic stroke therapies is innovative and will benefit veterans’ health.
In the second study funded by I01BX004625, we will investigate the roles of microglia-oligodendrocyte
interactions in white matter injury and tissue repair and to explore glia-oriented therapeutic strategies for treating
TBI. Microglia activation plays a role in white matter injury and tissue repair. Regulation of a switch between pro-
inflammatory and adaptive phenotypes of microglia/macrophage is important for oligodendrocyte differentiation,
remyelination, as well as remodeling of synapses. We recently discovered that Na/H exchanger isoform 1 protein
(NHE1)-mediated H+ efflux maintains microglial intracellular pH homeostasis to promote NADPH oxidase
activation, free radical superoxide production, and cytokine secretion. We reported that selective deletion of
microglial Nhe1 in the Cx3cr1-CreER;Nheflox/flox (Nhe1 KO) mice preserved oligodendrocytes and improved
sensorimotor function recovery in an experimental focal ischemic stroke model. Nhe1 KO mice exhibited
increased APC+ mature oligodendrocyte counts and preserved white matter integrity in a controlled cortical
impact-induced TBI model. Especially, post-TBI administration of the NHE1 protein inhibitor HOE642 accelerated
neurological function recovery in mice after either stroke or TBI. We will further investigate NHE1 protein in
modulating microglia-mediated inflammation in remyelination and tissue repair after TBI."

 This competitive renewal application of my RCS program is focused on a major health problem of vision
loss caused by the traumatic eye and brain injury. Both, traumatic eye and brain injuries lead to vision loss and
ocular tissue damage that affects veterans’ health and quality of life immensely. Eye and brain trauma are the
major cause of vision loss among our veterans and troops engaged in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF),
Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), New Dawn, and fighting terrorism. Despite using protective gears, eye injuries
has risen from 2% in World Wars to 13% in OIF and OEF. Presently, >167,000 Veterans are legally blind, 1.5
million have significantly compromised vision, and >7000 veterans becoming blind each year. Both, traumatic
eye and brain injuries are becoming more common among Veterans, active military personnel, and civilians.
Also, the population of elderly Veterans continues to increase, and therefore development of novel molecular
therapies has become a vital priority of VA research mission.
 Our research is focused on studying the impact of traumatic eye and brain injuries on vision loss. Our
projects are focused towards developing novel nanomedicine and gene-based therapies for treating corneal
fibrosis/scarring, uncovering pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to corneal damage, and advancing the
mechanistic understanding of corneal wound healing and diabetic retinopathy. The long-range goal of our
research is to establish novel efficacious and safe molecular therapies to treat blindness and restore vision in
humans and service dogs. We are pursuing four specific projects to achieve our immediate and long-range goals.
Project-1 establishes how traumatic eye and brain injuries lead to significant eye defects and blindness acutely
and transpire over time by evaluating the impact of chemical/surgical injury on vision loss. Project-2 elucidates the
role of epigenetic mechanisms and signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of corneal fibrosis (also called haze
or scarring) and other ocular disorders. Project-3 aims to develop novel nanomedicine and gene therapy
approaches for treating corneal fibrosis/opacity and restoring vision using established human in vitro, human
organ culture, and in vivo animal (rabbit, pig and rodent) models that mimic pathological conditions seen in
human patients. Project-4 is focused on studying the pathogenesis processes linked to chemical toxicity and
developing multimodal topical ophthalmic drops to mitigate acute and chronic toxicity caused by warfare and
toxic chemicals, sulfur mustard, acrolein, chlorine, and hydrogen sulfide.
 Our laboratory has been very productive during the current RCS funding, and over the years with 140+
peer review journal research articles, 350+ scientific presentations, 10 book chapters, and 47 invited
distinguished speaker talks at prestigious institutions including the Harvard Medical School and global scientific
meetings including the World Ophthalmology Congress, ARVO, European Vision and Eye Research,
International Society for Eye Research, Asia-Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology, Precision Medicine etc. In
present RCS cycle, I have delivered 27 international invited talks in UK, France, Italy, Asia, Canada, South Africa,
USA etc. and collectively 44 prestigious honors and awards were conferred to my trainees and me. Also, our
research has received >8,200 citations with an H-factor of 48 and an i-10-index of 98 (>3000 citations during
current RCS cycle). Our eye translational research has led to several important discoveries in the areas of
corneal gene therapy, nanomedicine, wound healing, and diabetic retinopathy and has received continuous
funding from federal (VA and NIH) and non-federal (foundations, industry etc.) agencies for over $40 million. Our
ongoing studies are highly translational and are designed to identify novel therapeutic targets, provide
mechanistic insights into the role of the key signaling pathways in the pathophysiology of the corneal diseases,
and lead to the development of effective therapies to treat blindness that impact the health of veterans."
10840359,"Sleep is integral to health. Humans should be asleep for a third of their lives, yet we are becoming increasingly
sleep deprived. Poor or insufficient sleep increases the risk for a number of pathologies including
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Sleep, however, varies across an individual's lifetime — sleep time and quality
deteriorate in the elderly. Congruent with sleep deterioration, CVD risk increases with age. These observations
raise a fundamental question; does sleep disruption directly contribute to age-associated CVD? Here we will
explore the biological pathways that connect sleep, aging, and cardiovascular health. Recently, we
demonstrated that sleep fragmentation (SF) in mice augments hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC)
proliferation in the bone marrow (BM), leading to monocytosis, neutrophillia, and larger atherosclerotic lesions.
We identified a neuro-immune communication axis whereby the sleep-regulating neuropeptide hypocretin
signals to the hematopoietic niche to regulate pre-neutrophils' production of the myeloid growth factor colony
stimulating factor-1. Here we build on our published findings and preliminary data to explore the hypothesis
that that sleep disruption advances the biological age of the hematopoietic niche and augments vascular
inflammation through epigenetic and senescent programs. We will explore this hypothesis using innovative
mouse models and technologies. Aim 1 interrogates the hematopoietic niche stromal compartment of young (3-
month-old) and aged (18-month-old) mice of both sexes exposed to 16 weeks of SF. We will identify ways in
which sleep shapes niche structure and organization and explore the function of endothelial cell senescence,
transcriptional landscape, and IL-6 signaling in these phenotypes. Aim 2 investigates hypocretin signaling in
the hematopoietic niche in young and aged mice of both sexes. Using innovative mouse models we will profile
hypocretin-producing and responsive cells in the BM and query their transcriptional and epigenetic programs.
Aim 3 moves from the BM to the vessel wall. We will investigate SF-induced atherogenesis in young and aged
Apoe-/- mice of both sexes. We will explore the role of vascular cell senescence and leukocyte dynamics in
atheromata growth and stability. Single cell technology will be used to identify cellular composition and
transcriptional landscapes. This program will apply state-of-the-art technologies to investigate systems-level
communication networks. Our interrogations into the hematopoietic niche, neuropeptide signaling in the BM,
and atherogenesis in the vessel wall will reveal the function of sleep in age-associated CVD and will fill crucial
knowledge gaps with direct clinical translation."

Molecular mechanisms of calcification: roles and opportunities in diseases of aging. Ectopic
calcification is a hallmark of major diseases of aging, including Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and
Alzheimer's Disease (AD), disorders that each represent the leading causes of central vision loss and
dementia among the aging population worldwide, and are currently incurable. There is an urgent need to
understand disease mechanisms to enable the development of effective treatments. The overall goal of this
Program Project is to elucidate the biological mechanisms of ectopic calcification and its role in the onset and
etiology of diseases of aging, with particular focus on age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The major components of the ectopic calcifications in AMD and AD are proteins,
lipids and mineralized calcium phosphate, especially in the form of hydroxyapatite (HAP) and whitlockite
(WHT), but the roles of these components in the calcification process and disease progression are not known.
Four Projects, an administrative Core and a technical Core, will synergize to investigate ectopic calcification at
the molecular, cellular and organismal levels, and build a comprehensive view of the key molecules and
pathways responsible for this aging-related phenomenon. There are three overall Goals: (1) Elucidate the
molecular mechanisms of ectopic calcification; (2) Develop diagnostic sensors for ectopic calcification; and (3)
Dissect intra- and extra-cellular factors of ectopic calcification. The primary role of administrative Core will be to
facilitate interactions among the investigators to generate a comprehensive view of calcification that could not
be achieved by individual laboratories working alone."
10880246,"Project Summary/Abstract
A priority in oncology and palliative care is preparing the 3.2 million U.S. family caregivers of persons with
cancer to effectively support patients in health-related decision-making from diagnosis to the end of life,
particularly in underserved settings. Over 70% of patients with cancer involve family in health decisions,
including choices about treatments, surgery, location of care, accessing palliative care, and many others.
Patients making these decisions with unprepared family caregivers may experience inadequate family decision
support leading to heightened distress and receipt of care/treatments inconsistent with their values and
preferences. This in turn may increase distress for family caregivers. There is a critical need to train cancer
family caregivers to effectively support patient decision-making; however, few palliative care interventions have
been tested to enhance caregiver skills in providing decision support. We have developed CASCADE (CAre
Supporters Coached to be Adept DEcision partners), a lay navigator-led, telehealth early palliative care
intervention to train advanced cancer caregivers how to effectively partner with patients in health decision-
making. Evolving out of our prior early palliative care caregiving interventions, decision support relevant
content for family caregivers includes principles of effective social support, communication, and Ottawa
Decision Guide training; however we do not know which of these components and component interactions
influences patient and caregiver decision-making outcomes. Traditional research approaches treat
interventions as “bundled” treatment packages, making it difficult to assess definitively which intervention
components can be reduced, eliminated, or replaced to improve efficiency. Hence, we propose a randomized
23 (2x2x2) factorial trial, the first such trial in oncology palliative care, using the Multiphase Optimization
Strategy (MOST) to test components of CASCADE in order to assemble an optimized, scalable version of the
intervention. 352 family caregivers of persons with newly-diagnosed advanced cancer will be randomized to
receive one or more palliative care lay navigator-delivered decision partnering training components, based on
the Ottawa Decision Support Framework and Social Support Effectiveness Theory: 1) psychoeducation on
social support effectiveness in decision support (1 vs. 3 sessions); 2) decision support communication training
(yes vs. no); and 3) Ottawa Decision Guide training (yes vs. no). We will determine CASCADE components
(main effects/interactions) that contribute meaningfully to patient and caregiver outcomes, including patient
healthcare utilization (Aim 1) and use those results to build a version of the CASCADE intervention that is
maximally effective and scalable (Aim 2). To maximize recruitment, we will recruit from two NCI-designated
comprehensive cancer centers in Birmingham, AL and Atlanta, GA. Using the innovative MOST framework will
yield a highly novel and cost effective version of CASCADE primed for confirmatory RCT testing, scalability,
and reproducibility."
10910996,"The overarching goal of this research is to develop predictive multiscale biophysical models of adaptive
evolutionary dynamics. The new concept of Biophysical Fitness Landscape (BFL) is a map of protein/nucleic
acid molecular properties to fitness. We demonstrated the conceptual validity of BFL by discovering a simple
and accurate quantitative relationship between fitness of E. coli and molecular properties of important core
metabolic enzymes. This finding transforms the concept of fitness landscape from an artful metaphor into a
quantitative tractable tool to predict the genotype-phenotype relationship (GPR). Here we take these findings
as a foundation to further extend our understanding of interplay between biophysical and population factors
that determine the dynamics and outcome of adaptive evolution. We will apply biophysical analysis, automated
robotics setup along with protein engineering and genomic editing tools to explore evolutionary dynamics in
laboratory experiments under conditions that allow tight control on all scales – from molecules to populations.
As a key model we carry out a set of evolution experiments with adapting populations of E. coli escaping from
antibiotic stress and structural instability of the essential protein Dihydrofolate Reductase. We characterize on
all scales – genotyping, molecular traits, systems proteomics and metabolomics and population - multiple
evolutionary paths to resistance and adaption of emerging bacterial strains and determine at which level of
description (genotype, biophysical properties, systems responses) evolution becomes reproducible – and by
implication predictable. We model the evolutionary dynamics using multiscale models where cytoplasm of
model cells is presented in a biophysically realistic manner, and fitness of model organisms is predicted from
its molecular traits using experimentally derived BFL. Comprehensive molecular mapping of possible escape
routes will provide an opportunity to rationally design new class of compounds – “evolution drugs” - that
comprehensively block pathogen’s resistance. In a related effort we will explore the biophysical underpinnings
of codon adaptation to discern their effects on mRNA and cotranslational protein folding. A tight integration
between theory and experiment will provide an opportunity to develop predictive evolutionary models of ever
increasing accuracy and realism. Progress along these lines will transform our approaches to study
evolutionary dynamics from descriptive into predictive and quantitative, which will be instrumental to the
development of novel approaches to fight antibiotic resistance and, potentially, viral escape from stressors
such as drugs and immune response."

10873017,"Project Summary
Sleep disturbance is prevalent in persons living with mild cognitive impairment or early-stage Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias (PLwCI) as well as their caregivers. This prevalence suggests that sleep
disturbance is an interdependent process that synergistically affects both members of the caregiving dyad.
Sleep disturbance is associated with poorer health outcomes, including higher depressive symptoms and lower
quality of life. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) is effective for improving sleep disturbance in
many populations, and support from a partner during CBTI results in more successful outcomes. The
interdependence of PLwCI-caregiver sleep disturbance suggests the need for a dyadic intervention. However,
there are no structured fully dyadic interventions focused on managing sleep disturbance in PLwCI and their
caregivers; moreover, no dyadic interventions have been developed with input from these stakeholders.
Aligned with the National Institute of Aging’s Behavioral and Social Science and Neuroscience high-priority
dementia caregiver research agenda, the proposed K23 Patient-Oriented Mentored Career Development
Award seeks to use design thinking, human-centered approaches within the CBTI framework to tailor a dyadic
intervention (T-Dyadic Sleep) for PLwCI and their caregivers. Twenty PLwCI-caregiver dyads and 10
healthcare providers will be interviewed during the tailoring phase. We will then conduct a waitlist randomized
control trial (N = 40 dyads) to test the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary immediate and sustained
efficacy (3 months) of T-Dyadic Sleep. The completion of this mentored research project will enable me to
acquire foundational knowledge for conducting large-scale intervention trials and fulfill the need for effective
dyadic interventions to treat sleep disturbance in PLwCI and caregiver dyads. The interdisciplinary training plan
and goals developed for this K23 award will fill a critical gap in my current skill set. Building on my training as a
clinician with expertise in sleep and dementia caregiving, I will develop proficiency in 1) design thinking
approaches, 2) dyadic theories, concepts, and analytic methods, 3) identification and diagnosis of dementia-
related disorders, including a focus on how these disorders relate to sleep disturbance, and 4) scientific writing,
oral presentations, manuscript development, and peer review. I have assembled an excellent team of mentors
(Drs. Hepburn, Barton, Lyons and Lah) and a collaborator (Dr. Gehrman). The K23 award will provide me with
the necessary foundation to build a successful and independent program of research related to sleep,
dementia, and caregiving. My program of research aligns well with NIA’s Strategic Directions for Research to
understand and develop interventions to address the needs of patients living with Alzheimer’s disease and
related dementias as well as the needs of their caregivers, and to engage persons living with dementia and
their caregivers as part of research teams."
10880239,"Exosomes are small extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are secreted from multivesicular
endosomes (MVE) and have been recently recognized to promote cancer metastasis.
Exosomes carry bioactive proteins, lipids and nucleic acids and are an important but poorly
understood component of the tumor microenvironment. We recently discovered that actin-rich
invasive structures called invadopodia are key docking sites for MVE in cancer cells, leading to
enhanced exosome secretion. Furthermore, we found that the key invadopodia regulator
cortactin enhances MVE docking and exosome secretion. Notably, cortactin is gene amplified
and overexpressed in a number of cancers, especially in head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC). Furthermore, cortactin overexpression in HNSCC is correlated with
decreased patient survival and increased metastasis. Based on these data, we hypothesize that
cortactin overexpression drives poor prognosis in HNSCC due to its key role in
promoting exosome secretion. Furthermore, we hypothesize that key exosome cargoes
synergize with cortactin to promote tumor-induced angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis,
and metastasis. Specifically, we have identified EphB-ephrinB signaling as a key angiogenic
axis regulated by HNSCC-secreted exosomes. Thus, we propose that both the number and
molecular cargo of exosomes drive aggressive HNSCC behavior in a synergistic manner. We
will test these hypotheses and leverage our work to identify potential exosomal blood-and
tissue-based biomarkers of regional and distant metastasis."
10814833,"Project summary.
Common operations for unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP), such as Thyroplasty Type 1,
improve vocal efficiency (VE) by closing the membranous gap between the normal and
paralyzed fold. VE measures the degree to which subglottal aerodynamic power is translated to
acoustic power. However, even after surgical treatment, some patients report symptoms such
as vocal fatigue, decreased projection, and decreased intelligibility in noisy environments.
These recalcitrant symptoms will be associated with reduced VE relative to normal voice,
suggesting that enhancing VE could further ameliorate these symptoms. Our previous work in
the excised canine larynx suggests that this further improvement is possible by certain
modifications to the procedure. For example, we found the surprising result that medialization of
the tissue below the fold (infraglottal region) results in higher VE than medialization of the fold
itself (glottal) even though both operations close the medial-lateral membranous gap.
Additionally, inclusion of arytenoid adduction increased VE relative to infraglottal medialization
alone. However, to translate these surgical findings in animals to patients requires a deeper
understanding about how and why various treatment modifications affect VE. In prior work we
found that rotational motion (vortices) occur between the folds during closing. These vortices
produce negative pressures that cause the folds to close together faster, which increase
acoustic intensity and VE. We know that the bottom part of the folds is stiffer than the upper
part; this is referred to as the vertical stiffness gradient (VSG). We have also found that lower
VSG produces weaker vortices and decreased VE. In the first aim, we will further examine the
effect of the VSG on VE. In the second and third aim, we will look at how and why different
treatments for UVFP affect VE. This application lays the foundation for using VE clinically, and
for optimizing clinical treatments for UVFP."

The core mission of the Molecular Biophysics Training Program (MBTP) at Northwestern University (NU) is to
train the next generation of pre-doctoral students in the highly interdisciplinary field of molecular biophysics.
This field seeks to describe and explain biological phenomena using fundamental physical, chemical, and
mathematical principles and to leverage this knowledge to develop new medicinal therapies and engineer new
biomedical tools and applications. As the sole training program at NU dedicated to this area, for 30 years
MBTP has played a key role in strengthening intellectual ties and stimulating interdisciplinary collaborations
among program preceptors, catalyzed by student trainees, spread over seven departments in the schools of
arts & sciences, medicine, and engineering.
 Six pre-doctoral student trainees in their second and third years of graduate education from seven feeder
graduate programs will be recruited to and supported by the training program for a maximum of two years,
allowing the program to have the greatest impact early in their careers as trainees complete the required
coursework, learn to think critically, frame research questions independently, acquire and hone the requisite
technical skills to answer these questions, and develop operational skills to be effective communicators and
researchers. Trainee learning will occur through the completion of a core biophysics curriculum established by
the program that will allow students from diverse backgrounds to share a common didactic experience.
Trainees will have numerous opportunities to develop and hone oral presentation skills at program-sponsored
forums from intimate settings like journal clubs and research-in-progress meetings held every month to larger
audiences at monthly intramural seminars and the annual symposium. Monthly seminars, annual symposia
and career development forums featuring external speakers, who are also leaders in academia, industry, and
other non-academic careers will not only provide trainees with opportunities for broadening and deepening
knowledge in the field but also for networking and career advancement. MBTP is deeply committed towards
the development of all students including those from underrepresented backgrounds for broad impact.
 The overarching goal of MBTP is to prepare pre-doctoral students of exceptional promise in the early
stages of their scientific careers to conduct rigorous, reproducible, and responsible research in molecular
biophysics by facilitating the development of both general competencies as well as the uniquely molecular
biophysical skills of deep analytical and quantitative reasoning and expertise in the application of cutting-edge
technologies to solve complex biological problems. By achieving our overarching goal, we will set students on
a trajectory towards independence in thought and action with skills that are compatible with a spectrum of
productive, intellectually-demanding careers in academia, industry, and beyond."
10812301,"Following a decade of significant strides forward, the global malaria eradication agenda has stalled, due
in part to the accelerating emergence of insecticide-resistant mosquitoes and drug-resistant malarial parasites.
The World Health Organization and others have called for the development of new strategies to help defeat
this devastating disease that infects over 2 million people and killing over 400,000 annually, predominantly
young children in impoverished regions. Gene-drives, which can bias inheritance of desired traits, offer a novel
and promising strategy either to eliminate disease causing insect vectors, or to immunize them against
pathogens. Such super-Mendelian CRIPSR-based gene-drive systems encode bipartite transgenic cassettes
consisting of the Cas9 endonuclease and a guide RNA (gRNA), which directs DNA cleavage at the genomic
site of insertion. In reproductive cells, such targeted cutting of the homologous chromosome results in copying
the drive element at the cleavage site through homology directed repair, resulting in nearly all progeny
inheriting the drive element and its cargo.
 My group has contributed to developing the first CRIPSR-based gene drive (or active genetic) systems in
flies, mosquitoes, mammals, and bacteria. We also pioneered allelic-drive systems designed to bias
inheritance of a favored allelic variant at a separate genetic locus. In addition, we have developed, and
extensively tested, two types of self-copying drive neutralizing systems, both of which carry gRNAs, but no
source of Cas9. ERACRs delete and replace gene-drives, while e-CHACRs copy themselves while mutating
and inactivating the Cas9 transgene carried on a gene-drive. Small population cage experiments in flies and
mosquitoes have shown that highly efficient gene-drives rapidly spread through target populations, and that
ERACRs and e-CHACRs can reliably replace (ERACRs) or halt (e-CHACRs) a gene-drive element.
 In this grant, we propose first to develop a flexible two-component (split-drive or CHACR) system that can
be genetically converted (or hacked) into a single full-drive system. The split and full drive elements are
inserted into genes essential for viability or reproduction, and also carry recoded cDNAs of the targeted genes
to restore function of those loci. These recoded systems benefit greatly from a phenomenon we discovered
and refer to as lethal/sterile mosaicism, which dominantly eliminates loss-of-function alleles (mistakes) in the
target gene generated by imprecise DNA repair events rather than the intended copying event. Next, we will
develop and test next-generation ERACR and e-CHACRs able to eliminate or halt our recoded-drives, and also
test a self-limiting drive system that slowly targets Cas9 for mutagenesis. In parallel to these drive experiments,
we will delve into the mechanisms and timing of the drive process using a unique set of image-based genetic
elements we have developed. We anticipate that the intellectual advances and implementable game-changing
technologies from these studies will contribute importantly to solving critical global challenges in human health."
10808172,"Monocytes and macrophages are essential for tissue homeostasis, but in the context of metabolic disorders they
become dysfunctional and promote chronic inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis. However, the
underlying mechanisms are not well-understood. We showed that chronic exposure of blood monocytes to
nutrient stress induced by a “Western”-style high-calorie diet (HCD) stimulates the formation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and promotes protein thiol oxidation, resulting in monocyte dysfunction and the reprogramming
of blood monocytes into a pro-inflammatory, pro-atherogenic phenotype, hyper-sensitive to chemoattractants.
These metabolically “primed” blood monocytes give rise to reprogrammed and dysfunctional macrophages,
sensitive to oxysterol-induced cell death, with defective autophagy and dysregulated activation profiles.
Monocyte priming by nutrient stress is mediated by the H2O2-dependent S-glutathionylation, inactivation and
degradation of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1), a master regulator of both monocyte
adhesion and migration and macrophage function and plasticity. However, the source of HCD-induced H2O2 and
“oxidative stress” in “primed” blood monocytes is not known. We have now identified monoamine oxidase A (Mao
A) and NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) as novel sources of H2O2 induced by nutrient stress in monocytes and
macrophages and as mediators of nutrient stress-induced monocyte priming and dysfunction. We hypothesize
that the induction of Mao A in monocytes in response to a HCD accelerates atherogenesis by promoting
H2O2 production and the inactivation of MKP-1, resulting in monocyte priming and reprogramming, and
giving rise to dysfunctional, hyper-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic monocyte-derived macrophages
with impaired inflammation resolving capabilities. Furthermore, we propose that by inactivating the thiol
transferase glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1) and disrupting thiol redox homeostasis, Mao A-derived H2O2 promotes the
induction of Nox4, amplifying the oxidative stress response triggered by HCD. To test these hypotheses and to
elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we propose the following Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Determine the mechanisms by which high-calorie diet-triggered induction of Mao A
promotes monocyte dysfunction, dysregulates macrophage plasticity, and accelerates atherogenesis.
Specific Aim 2: Determine the contribution of Nox4 to high-calorie diet-induced monocyte priming,
macrophage dysfunction, and atherogenesis.
Specific Aim 3: Determine the molecular mechanisms by which high-calorie diets trigger monocyte
priming and reprogramming in metabolically healthy human subjects and whether and to what extent
these mechanisms differ from mice."

of training the next generation of scientific leaders striving to solve important biological problems using Molecular
Biophysics approaches. To accomplish this goal, trainees with strong quantitative backgrounds and a
demonstrated aptitude, commitment, and passion for research are selected at the end of their first year from a
diverse group of applicants from 32 well-funded training faculty labs. The MBTG faculty are highly
interdisciplinary and many have cross-campus appointments in several departments. Trainees come mostly from
two graduate programs, Chem/Biochem and Biomedical Sciences but a few come from Physics, Biology and
Bioengineering. During their first year, all students engage in research rotations and choose a research lab. At
UCSD, students are free to rotate with any faculty across campus and to choose any faculty for their thesis
advisor. First year students receive training from their respective graduate programs in critical reading of
literature, exposure to important unsolved biological problems, ethics and graduate school survival skills. MBTG
Trainees are appointed and choose their thesis committee at the end of their first year. All MBTG trainees take
two rigorous core courses in Molecular Biophysics and will have an intensive week-long Statistics workshop.
During their second year, they write and defend their thesis research proposal. Required trainee activities include
a full-length seminar presentation of their research at the monthly student seminar, monthly discussions of rigor
and reproducibility, a monthly journal club, a yearly retreat, career workshops and outside mentors. Trainees
may apply to be reappointed for a maximum of two years of support. All trainees present their research every
year at the annual retreat, with alumni trainees giving lightning talks each year until graduation. Throughout their
graduate training, trainees take advantage of career development opportunities and mentorship, including yearly
IDPs and group and individual engagement with outside mentors. The program emphasizes the development of
creative independent thinking, strong quantitative skills with a focus on rigor and reproducibility, scientific
communication, and mentoring. The MBTG provides the critical interdisciplinary “home” at UCSD for students
and faculty interested in Molecular Biophysics. The high quality of student publications, postdoctoral fellowships,
faculty positions, and industry positions obtained by our trainees are strong evidence of successful training
outcomes. Given the depth, quality, and diversity of our student pool and our demonstrated training outcomes, we
request 12 students be supported each year."
10821316,"Taylor, Martin | K08 (PA-20-203) | PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This proposal details a five-year training plan for the development of a research program focused on elucidating
structural, mechanistic, and allosteric determinants of mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) signaling. Phosphorylation
of the signaling kinase Akt on Ser473 by mTOR Complex 2 (mTORC2) is a critical regulated intracellular step in
insulin and other growth factor signaling. Ser473 phosphorylation activates Akt and is required for Akt’s
downstream metabolic effects, such as glucose transporter upregulation, which are dysregulated in diabetes,
and proliferation and growth, which are dysregulated in cancer. Therapeutic modulation of mTORC2 is therefore
of interest in the treatment of both diabetes and cancer but is not yet possible due to similarities between
mTORC2 and the better-understood effector complex mTORC1, which shares key components mTOR and
mLST8. mTORC2 also activates other substrates with less-defined roles in ion channel homeostasis, apoptosis,
cell motility, metastasis, and insulin receptor sensitivity, and its activity is modulated by a series of allosteric
interacting proteins including the small GTPases Rho and Ras. However, despite the central role of mTORC2-
Akt signaling, we have little information about how this critical reaction is catalyzed by mTORC2, how mTORC2
recognizes Akt and other substrates, or how these interactions are modulated allosterically. This project therefore
seeks to develop a detailed structural and mechanistic understanding of mTORC2 recognition of its substrates,
using novel enzymologic assays, protein engineering, and a combination of biochemical, chemical, proteomic,
and structural biology approaches that will also develop proof-of-concept inhibitors and potentially activators of
mTORC2.

The Developmental Neurology Training Program at Boston Children's Hospital is designed to produce trainees
who are equipped for and deeply engaged in state-of-the-art research in developmental neuroscience from a
detailed and mechanistic perspective, while also cognizant of the clinical importance of their field and the
clinical challenges and opportunities today. A key aspect of the program is the attention given to experimental
design, statistics, and quantitative skills that contribute to rigorous science. We take advantage of the presence
of an extraordinary community of basic neuroscientists at Children's Hospital and its affiliated institutions. We
select outstanding candidates who will work in one of 30 mentor laboratories and engage in fundamental
mechanistic research. These highly interactive laboratories employ genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry,
imaging, electrophysiology, anatomy and behavior and use diverse experimental systems. Consequently, our
trainees are exposed to the full breadth of the field and are prepared to make informed strategic decisions. The
goal of the program is not to distract from an intensive research experience in fundamental molecular
mechanisms of neurodevelopment, but rather to ensure the highest standards of rigor in experimental design
and analysis and to inform the trainees of the context of the research in human health. The training program is
also designed to have a spill-over effect of enhancing the attention to rigor and quantitative skills in the broader
community of neuro-research trainees and their mentors. Each trainee is also paired with a clinician or
clinician-scientist as a co-mentor with the goal of helping trainees to understand the relationship of basic
research to health and disease. This co-mentoring relationship will take advantage of the hospital setting and
augment the rich opportunities for learning about translational research. The research experience of the trainee
also enhanced by an extensive mentoring relationship with the Directors of the Training Program, Prof.
Thomas Schwarz and Prof. Elizabeth Engle, who meet with and advise the trainees to offer feedback and
career guidance, and by monthly trainee group meetings and a trainee-organized seminar series. The training
experience is further supplemented by a wealth of career-guidance instruction, including presentation skills,
job-seeking skills, information about diverse career options, and of course the responsible conduct of research.
All of this is situated within an environment of extraordinary resources and intellectual life. We have recruited a
racially and ethnically diverse faculty of mentors and are committed to enhancing the diversity of the
community of neuroscientists through our Training Program. There are few challenges in neuroscience as
great as understanding the processes that result in neurodevelopmental disorders and intellectual disabilities
and there is a growing awareness that many affective disorders arise from errors in development. To face this
challenge, the next generation will require rigorous training and strong quantitative skills. Without deeper
mechanistic understanding of these processes, the clinical challenges will remain."

Skeletal muscle atrophy and muscle wasting is associated with both acute and chronic pathological conditions
such as traumatic spinal cord injury and inpatient bedrest. Decreases in muscle mass from the atrophy is
associated with power outcomes to other comorbidities, and increased susceptibility to obesity and diabetes.
Current pharmaceutical interventions to increase muscle mass have been limited in their effectiveness. This poor
efficacy is in part due to the limited understanding of the different mechanisms that contribute to decrease muscle
mass. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed as one of the contributors to skeletal muscle atrophy.
However, the precise mechanisms that contribute to impaired mitochondrial functionality and the development
of skeletal muscle atrophy is unknown. Mitochondrial dynamics have emerged as key regulators of both
physiology and pathology in skeletal muscle. We have recently reported that induced adult skeletal muscle
deletion of both mitofusin 1 and 2 have a profound effect on exercise capacity. Furthermore, preliminary analysis
of these animals exhibit signs of decrease muscle mass and the induction of the unfolded protein response
(UPR) and atrophy genes. We also observed elevated levels of FGF21 in skeletal muscle and circulation. These
data suggest that adult skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated muscle-derived FGF21
contributes to the development of muscle atrophy. Furthermore, utilizing a spinal cord injury (SCI) model, which
develops pathological skeletal muscle atrophy, we observe elevated levels of skeletal muscle Fgf21 mRNA. We
hypothesize that the observed elevated skeletal muscle derived FGF21 in circulation further contributes to the
observed atrophy. Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is to understand the contribution of
mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle to the development of skeletal muscle atrophy. Using genetic
models and translatable therapeutic interventions we will attempt to address this very important question. Results
from this proposal have broad implications for our understanding of the molecular changes that contribute to the
development of skeletal muscle atrophy. The specific aims are to: 1.) Establish the requirement of FGF21
signaling for skeletal muscle atrophy in response to muscle mitochondrial dysfunction; 2.) Reveal the
contribution of elevated FGF21 in the development of skeletal muscle atrophy in response to a contusion spinal
cord injury (SCI); 3.) Determine whether pharmacologic inhibition of FGF21 signaling after spinal cord injury
(SCI) prevents skeletal muscle atrophy. This proposal will to provide much needed insights into our
understanding of molecular pathogenesis of skeletal muscle atrophy."
10811670,"Granulomas are complex immunologic structures formed in tissues in response to infection. The general function of a granuloma has been elusive because many infections that stimulate granuloma responses do not resolve. Often, granulomas are described as immunologic responses that wall off an infectious agent that cannot be cleared by the immune system. Basic understandings of the fundamentals of a granuloma have been elusive because mouse models where granulomas form are rare or complicated. We have discovered a novel bacterial infection model where the murine immune system forms a granuloma. When mice are infected by Chromobacterium violaceum, the immunologic response fails to clear the bacterium from the liver within the first several days. Then a granuloma forms around the infected lesion, and this complex immunologic response successfully sterilizes the infection and returns the organ to homeostasis typically within 7-14 days post infection. Therefore, we have discovered a novel infectious model where basic granuloma biology can be elucidated. C. violaceum first infects hepatocytes and perhaps Kupffer cells in the liver. This rapidly stimulates a neutrophil swarm within the first day post infection. However, the neutrophil swarm fails to eradicate the infection, and the neutrophils themselves appear to become replicative intracellular niches for the bacterium. Three days post infection the neutrophil swarm dies and forms a central necrotic core of the lesion. Macrophages begin to appear at the periphery of the lesion at 3 days post infection and form a thick macrophage zone that surrounds the necrotic core by day 5-7. Thereafter, the bacteria are killed through the action of inducible nitric oxide synthase, the granuloma is sterilized, and shrinks over the next week. Granuloma burdens are sterilized between 7-21 days post infection. This all occurs in the absence of T cells or other adaptive immune cells. In this grant, we use this novel granuloma model to explore the importance of pyroptotic cell death in the granuloma."
10864939,"Project Summary/Abstract
This proposal details a 5-yr plan to prepare the candidate, Ruobing Wang, MD, for a career as an independent
physician-scientist positioned to impact our understanding of pediatric lung diseases, particularly Cystic
Fibrosis (CF). As a clinician taking care of CF patients, she has identified rare individuals with homozygous
F508del CFTR mutations who met clinical criteria for inclusion as: 1) CF Long-term non-progressors (LTNP),
with preserved lung function 2) CF Rapid progressors (RP), whose lung function declines rapidly. Whole exome
sequencing uncovered rare missense polymorphisms in i) SCNN1 (which encodes epithelial sodium channel
ENaC) in LTNPs, and ii) two genes in epithelial alternative chloride channels (ANO1 and SCL26A9) in RPs. The
central hypothesis of the proposal is that the extreme phenotypes of CF are due to the alterations in
epithelial ion and fluid transport driven by these gene defects, and that the extreme-phenotype disease
severity and mechanism can be modeled and studied in vitro with a reprogrammed cell-based platform. Using
a novel protocol, Dr. Wang generated airway basal-like cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) which
can then differentiate into basal, multi-ciliated, and secretory lineages on air-liquid interface, forming a functioning
airway epithelium with intact barrier function and aberrant trans-epithelial chloride transport. Normalization of
chloride transport in these cells by CFTR gene editing confirms the reliability of her model to recapitulate CF
phenotype. The central goals of the project are to establish this novel iPSC-platform for CF disease modeling
and study the epithelial function of the extreme-phenotype patients. She is now uniquely poised to complete
the aims to 1) To test whether iPSC-derived airway epithelia can serve as a platform to model airway
epithelial ion and fluid transport and muco-ciliary transport in CF, 2) to model extreme-phenotype CF patient
and interrogate the role of candidate modifier genes and their impact on ion and fluid transport, and 3) To
establish the iPSC-platform for personalized drug response, and test the therapeutic role of pharmacologic
targeting of alternative ion channel candidates. Dr. Wang has 80% protected time from Boston Children's
Hospital (BCH) Division of Respiratory Diseases and the Department of Medicine. Her co-sponsors are 1) Dr.
Darrell Kotton at the Center for Regenerative Medicine (CReM) at Boston University (BU) with whom she has
trained for the past 1.5 years, and 2) Dr. Benjamin Raby, the chief of BCH Division of Respiratory Diseases.
Furthermore, Dr. Wang has assembled a team of extraordinary scientific advisory members, each bringing
their specific expertise, to assist her career development and scientific research. A detailed training plan is
presented that includes mentored research, didactic coursework, presentations at meetings, and a timeline for
completion of the research aims, preparation of manuscripts, and future R01 application. The proposed
research, training plan, mentorship committee, and scientific-clinical environment at BCH and BU will position
the candidate to transition to independence by the end of the award."
10844616,"ABSTRACT
During the first 3 years of life (YOL) the infant gut microbiome (GM) rapidly diversifies both in structure and
function, concomitant with dietary and environmental transitions. Critically, the GM response to specific external
stimuli is patient-specific, complicating individualized risk predictions. Healthy GM maturation includes accruing
multiple strains of the same species, which frequently differ in key functions. These functional differences, ac-
centuated by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and de novo mutations, could resolve conflicting associations of
the same species with both health and disease. The rationale behind our proposal is that strain- and species-
level variation in bacterial functions drives heterogenous GM responses to early-life (EL) dietary and antibiotic
perturbations, which explains, in part, individualized developmental trajectories. This proposal pursues two highly
complementary Aims: 1) Define strain-resolved functional maturation of the pediatric gut microbiome and
2) Investigate the acute effects of EL antibiotic (ELA) perturbation on strain dynamics, HGT, and micro-
biome maturation in preterm neonates and microbiota-humanized mice. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that
EL environmental exposures shape genomic diversification of gut species, causing lasting changes in GM com-
munity structure and microbial functions. We will leverage our unique set of 2,436 stools collected over the first
9 YOL from infants variably exposed to dietary and environmental stimuli. By combining culture-enriched meta-
genomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics, we will determine taxa-function relationships at the sub-spe-
cies level and power statistical models that predict the impact of EL exposures on strain diversification, microbe-
function associations, and transcriptional activity. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that ELAs acutely alter strain
dynamics and stimulate HGT and that the GM response to ELA can be predicted from baseline composition and
function. Here, we will interrogate 160 stools flanking variable ELA exposure in 80 preterm neonates in the first
4 months of life, combining culture-enriched metagenomics with selective culture and isolate sequencing to char-
acterize the preterm `plasmidome' and profile post-ELA strain dynamics and HGT. To identify microbiome-intrin-
sic responses to ELA, we will utilize an innovative transgenerational mouse model where germ-free dams receive
human, preterm, microbiota that is vertically transferred to their pups, which are treated with parenteral antibiot-
ics. We will use the resulting data to predict individual GM responses to specific antibiotics based on composition,
resistance gene content, and bacterial functions. Our proposal is innovative because our interdisciplinary re-
search team will characterize strain-level bacterial functions to understand the heterogeneity of GM responses
to EL perturbations on two pre-existing sets of human specimens; it is significant because it will identify features
that predict species-resolved GM-specific responses to EL selection. Our work will advance pediatric microbi-
ome research by comprehensively characterizing strain-resolved functional maturation and GM disruption to
understand individual variation leading towards a future of personalized, microbiome medicine."

Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell diseases, resulting predominantly from acquisition of somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC), which cause ineffective hematopoiesis, cytopenias, and possible progression to leukemia. The acquired and germline genomic alterations impact genes in diverse biological pathways, globally modifying gene expression or genomic integrity, including epigenetic regulation, RNA splicing, DNA repair, and transcription. At present a comprehensive understanding of biology promoting the development, progression and MDS resistance to therapy is lacking. One major obstacle for advancing our understanding of MDS biology has been the paucity of informative disease models. 
In this proposal we will develop critical resources for investigators pursuing MDS research including a) key information, a ‘roadmap’, of the mutational architecture of MDS; b) a repository of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived MDS HSPC cell lines; c) a comprehensive resource containing molecularly-defined drug sensitivities for MDS linked to key clinical data; d) a catalogue of novel antigenic targets and models to advance adoptive T cell immunotherapy for MDS patients. This research will enable a more rational approach to developing specific treatment strategies and predicting patient outcomes. 
The proposed studies will use a unique, large cohort of MDS marrow samples from a diverse population of patients with comprehensive clinical and genomic annotations. In Aim 1, we will reprogram MDS cells into iPSC, generating a panel of cell lines based on patient genotypes, and employ iPSCs and molecular data to reconstruct clonal histories and assess the functional consequence of mutation order. Aim 2 will focus on the functional consequences of MDS mutations, using a platform that integrates mutations, gene expression, and high-throughput sensitivity screens employing a large custom panel of drugs, targeted inhibitors, and combinations rationally designed for this disease. In Aim 3, we will use MDS primary samples and iPSC lines to perform proteomic analysis, linking mutational and proteomic data to discover potential new target antigens for T cell immunotherapies, permissive for normal hematopoiesis while eradicating MDS progenitors. 
Our proposed collaborative and synergistic studies will advance our understanding of the path from mutational perturbation to functional consequences in MDS and create a library of resources that can be shared with the greater MDS scientific community to enable further progress toward improved treatment strategies."

Neurovascular diseases, including stroke, aneurysms, and arteriovenous malformations, can cause
devastating and life-threatening injury to the brain. Each year these diseases affect nearly 1 million people
in the US. Stroke alone kills more than 130,000 Americans each year. Effective treatment of these diseases
requires understanding the cerebrovascular architecture, which is complex and patient specific. Existing
clinically available methods for imaging blood vessels in the brain are limited by several factors, including
spatial and temporal resolution, the need for ionizing radiation or contrast agents, and the lack of
availability of some types of imaging during surgical procedures.
We propose to generate patient-specific 4D models of cerebral vasculature with unprecedented spatial
and temporal resolution from a single pair of 2D Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) image sequences.
Two important advantages of using DSA are: 1) it has high spatial and temporal resolution; and 2) it is
readily available both pre-operatively, for planning surgery, and intra-operatively, for monitoring the
surgical procedure. To pursue this goal, we will investigate novel approaches for contouring vessels in DSA
images, extracting information about blood flow with high temporal resolution from DSA video
sequences, and annotating the contoured vessels with this temporal data. We will expand our recent work
on constrained 2D-to-3D reconstruction for generating patient-specific 4D cerebrovascular models that
will exploit these annotated vessel contours. The resultant models will support vessels as small as 0.1 mm3
and flow rates up to 15 frames per second, a 10-fold improvement in spatial and/or temporal resolution
over models generated from clinically available MRA, CTA and rotational DSA. Finally, we will develop new
software for visualizing and interacting with these 4D models and give surgeons the ability to virtually
inject a bolus of contrast at any point in the vascular network to observe downstream flow. This software
will give neurosurgeons a better understanding of their patient’s cerebral vasculature, allowing them to
plan and perform safer and more effective neurovascular surgery."

evolved to sustain its mission of enveloping medical students in mentored research opportunities that foster
their development into accomplished physician-scientists that positively impact human health. The last six
years have demonstrated unprecedented success in the level of student engagement and productivity with
ongoing achievement in the recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented groups. It is against
this backdrop of accelerated growth and diversification that we propose to sharpen our focus and deepen our
students' engagement with an exceptional cadre of enthusiastic mentors performing scientifically rigorous
trans-NIDDK research focused on digestive and liver diseases; endocrine and metabolic diseases; obesity and
nutritional disorders; or kidney and urologic diseases. Those four areas of investigation are long-standing
institutional strengths, and with seed funding from our College of Medicine, we have begun transitioning our
historically successful campus-wide single-stream funding model into a re-envisioned program with the same
high level administrative infrastructure now leveraged to selectively enhance recruitment and support of a
diverse cohort of M1 students that are committed to a summer of immersive research with our curated roster of
42 outstanding and experienced Participating Faculty on a project within the research mission of the NIDDK.
This training grant proposal seeks transformative funding for 16 students to participate in 12-week summer
fellowships, and the funds provided through this training grant would be matched by the College of Medicine,
amplifying the impact of the award. In synergy with extensive opportunities provided through relevant Centers
and Institutes, scholars will receive Instruction in Methods for Enhancing Reproducibility and the Responsible
Conduct of Research, as well as mentor-guided journal clubs and research seminars. In the years that follow,
students enroll in our research skills course, year-long research opportunities, the Research Distinction Track,
and dual degree programs. We closely monitor students alongside their mentors as they continue their
pathway towards a research career with incremental advancement through the continuity of support that is
available at our institution, including funding during residency, fellowship, and junior faculty appointments. We
critically evaluate every aspect of our extensive programing each year through a combination of anonymous
surveys and collaborative discussions to continuously enhance the exposure of our students to the entire
research process, from writing a proposal to analyzing data, presenting at local and national meetings, and
ultimately disseminating the results in peer reviewed journals. The long-term impact of this program is the
development of a diverse cohort of physicians that are equipped to extend their discoveries into real-life
applications that improve human health through prevention and improved treatment for gastrointestinal,
endocrine, metabolic, nutritional, renal and urologic disease."
10875361,"ABSTRACT
Despite advances in basic and translational neuroscience research, effective therapeutics for
neurodegenerative, neuroinflammatory, psychiatric, developmental, and neuroinfectious disorders remain in
want. The National Institutes of Health has recognized bench to bedside research to improve disease outcomes
and as such initiated programs to train researchers who can conceptualize new disease approaches to aide in
effective treatments for neurological disease. One critical “in need” area is neuroimmunity which remains
understudied despite its close linkage to the pathobiology of a broad spectrum of neurological disorders. The
tradition of training separate groups of students in the disciplines of neuroscience and immunology hinders field
growth. Following notable training successes, we seek continuance in training of predoctoral students in studies
of neuroimmunology with linkages to neuronal injury, differentiation, regeneration, and protection. The program
is designed to train 4 predoctoral students at a time in 1 or 2 year appointments with broad exposures to research
methods facilitating best approach, technical, and outcome proficiency. And that each student acquires a broad
interdisciplinary field knowledge. This allows for critical thinking in how inflammation affects disease
pathogenesis and treatment. Several approaches are proposed to achieve these goals. First, is providing
students training opportunities for multidisciplinary studies that intersect immunity and neural function. Second,
is the use of our textbook Neuroimmune Pharmacology designed specifically as a guide in the intersections
between neuroscience, immunology, and pharmacology. This is taught in our Neuroimmunology course. Third,
we will provide a unique conceptual framework to integrate approaches relevant to neuroimmunology research.
This contains, but is not limited to, systems biology, cell signaling, glial and neuronal biology, relevant rodent
and laboratory models, and synaptic-network physiology. Fourth, are our bi-monthly workshops with student
presentations to the program’s neuroscience and immunology faculty and a statistician to acquire feedback in
research design, uses and limits of quantitative approaches, statistical interpretations, and conceptualization of
ongoing research activities. These are highly interactive, diving into the mechanics of research and complement
the formal student research presentations at the program’s annual retreat. Fifth, are clinical neurological
experiences to gain the big-picture of a real-world perspective of neurological disease. Sixth, are “cross-
disciplinary internships” where students will complete thesis component(s) in another laboratory using a different
research approach and mentor. Seventh, are sustained community, university, and logistical support. By
coordinating the training efforts of divergent research groups linked by common interests in neuroimmunity,
trainees will develop deeper understandings of innate and adaptive immunity in relationship to neurologic
disease. Such trainees will be better prepared to develop successful careers in studies of disease pathobiology
and therapeutic interventions for human nervous system disorders."
10811687,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Engineering education must prepare trainees to meet the nation's workforce demands. Biomedical engineering
students require early, practical experience to develop the technical skills, knowledge of regulatory pathways,
and training in teamwork necessary to solve future unmet clinical needs. The undergraduate biomedical
engineering capstone design course is often used as a “catchall” to develop these critical professional skills;
however, in order to build competency, it is recommended that these skills be practiced throughout the
curriculum, not just at the end. Our goal is to develop a core, sophomore-level, medical devices course in
which students simulate the engineering teams found in industry in order to build workplace-ready skills. To
accomplish this goal, we will implement innovative instructional methods. Sophomore-level students will work
in teams, each with a defined engineering role. Teams will work through three medical device modules, and
each module will consist of four main phases: needs identification, design requirements, regulatory, and ethics.
Student teams will 1) evaluate how the engineering design process applies to the development of medical
devices, with an emphasis on defining the unmet need, developing design requirements, and applying the
voice of the customer; 2) create dimensioned models of medical devices by using computer-aided design; and
3) explain U.S. regulatory approval requirements to market different FDA classes of medical devices. We will
leverage existing partnerships between the University of Delaware Biomedical Engineering Department and
several local clinical sites to develop short videos of stakeholder perspectives of existing medical technologies,
which will allow us to scale up some of the benefits of traditional clinical immersion courses and bring the voice
of the customer to the students. Students will perform “device dissections” to take apart existing technology
and learn how the medical devices work, benefiting from a hands-on experience that develops their
engineering professional identities. Students will measure medical device components and recreate
engineering drawings, building industry-valued computer-aided design skills. Embedded throughout the
semester are professional proficiency lessons on high-performance teamwork and project management.
Through this process, students will evaluate the broader context of medical devices, including regulatory,
business, and ethical considerations. Overall, these approaches allow for explicit training in teamwork prior to
capstone, scalable instructional methods, and early introduction to medical device design. Combined, we
expect students to have increased biomedical engineering professional identity, industry-relevant skills,
teamwork abilities, and identification of medical device career opportunities, leading to enhanced retention and
representation in the biomedical engineering workforce."
10880259,"Heart failure (HF) affects nearly 6 million Americans and leads to significant impairments in functioning,
quality of life, and survival. Health behaviors (e.g., physical activity, low-sodium diet, medications) are
associated with improved health, including survival, in HF, but most HF patients do not adhere adequately to
these behaviors. Existing health behavior programs have had limited impact on adherence and cardiac
outcomes, are inaccessible to many patients, and do not target psychological factors independently associated
with heart health. Motivational interviewing- (MI-) based programs have been shown to increase engagement
in HF self-care behaviors but may not be sufficient to improve downstream health outcomes in HF patients.
 Positive psychology (PP), which utilizes systematic activities (e.g., using strengths, expressing
gratitude) to cultivate well-being, may be an important component of a health behavior program in HF. Positive
psychological constructs are prospectively and independently associated with both health behavior adherence
and improved cardiovascular health, and PP interventions have been shown to improve these constructs and
increase health behavior adherence in patients with or at risk for cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, PP
could be combined with MI to promote self-efficacy, motivation, and intention to engage in health behaviors.
 We recently completed a multi-stage project (REACH for Health) to develop a 12-week, telephone-
delivered, combined positive psychology-motivational interviewing (PP-MI) intervention to promote physical
activity, diet, and medication adherence in HF. We now aim to examine the efficacy of this program, with
additional twice weekly PP and health behavior text messages for a total of 24 weeks, compared to an MI-
based educational control condition, in an NIH Stage II, randomized clinical trial in 280 patients with New York
Heart Association class I-III HF and suboptimal adherence to physical activity, diet, or medications. The
primary study outcome will be change in objectively measured health behavior adherence (composite outcome
of moderate to vigorous physical activity [measured via accelerometer], sodium intake [24h urinary sodium],
and medication adherence [Medication Event Monitoring System electronic pill bottle]), and we hypothesize
that PP-MI will lead to greater improvements in adherence compared to the MI-based educational condition.
We also will measure the intervention’s impact on psychological health, quality of life, functional outcomes,
markers of cardiovascular health (e.g., body mass index, lipids, glucose), and major adverse cardiac events.
 We will utilize our team’s expertise in clinical trials, cardiology, and PP- and MI-based interventions to
effectively and efficiently perform the proposed trial, which—consistent with the goals of PA-18-722—aims to
“test [an] innovative approach…for maintaining individuals’…adherence to complex health care regimens.” If
effective, we will examine the intervention’s effects on cardiovascular health outcomes in a larger trial and will
begin to explore ways to implement this potentially highly scalable intervention in clinical settings."
10630365,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is a sex-based disparity associated with substance abuse disorders, which is evidenced by preclinical and
clinical studies. Females are generally more vulnerable to the initiation, escalation and withdrawal effects of
substance abuse behavior than males. Although these differences have largely been attributed to hormonal
differences, evidence for non-hormonal factors that regulate addiction has been demonstrated by a number of
studies. However, the mechanisms underlying sex chromosome influences on substance abuse behavior
represent a huge gap in our knowledge base on the epigenetics of substance use disorders. We propose a novel
hypothesis that escape from X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in females contributes to sex associated
differences in addiction behavior. We will apply cutting edge technology and uniquely novel approaches and
tools we developed recently to comprehensively investigate the impact of XCI escape on sex associated
disparities in addiction. XCI is an epigenetic mechanism that occurs in mammalian females and serves to
equalize gene expression between the sexes. Females have two X chromosomes (XX), and during XCI, one X
chromosome is randomly chosen to be transcriptionally silenced. However, it is known that a number of X linked
genes escape XCI and display bi allelic gene expression. The objective of this proposal is to determine the
contribution of XCI escape on sex-associated differences in substance abuse disorder. First, we will use novel
cutting edge mouse models to characterize cellular mono-allelic (XCI) or bi-allelic (XCI escape) gene expression
of specific X-linked genes associated with addiction to opioids and psychostimulants: monoamine oxidase A
(Maoa) and GABAA receptor A3 (Gabra3). I pioneered an innovative approach using a gene specific dual bi-
cistronic reporter mouse as a tool to enable the visualization of allelic usage of these addiction associated genes
in vivo in a model of addiction. Next, we will determine the molecular landscape of XCI in brain tissue and specific
neuronal cells during chronic exposure to opioids and psychostimulants, using a highly innovative single cell
RNA sequencing technology. To accomplish these goals, I have assembled a talented, multidisciplinary team of
research collaborators in addiction, neuroscience, genetic mouse modelling, bioinformatics and biostatistics.
This innovative approach to the study and analysis of gene specific XCI escape as an epigenetic mechanism in
the context of substance abuse has the potential to open up a new area of research on the epigenetics of
addiction. Further, these genetically modified mice can be used to study XCI escape as an epigenetic mechanism
in other neurologic disorders. As an early stage investigator, these studies will also advance my long term
objective of becoming a future leader in the epigenetics of substance use disorders."

Abstract
The long-term goal of the Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) for Stem Cells and Aging is to
develop a multidisciplinary translational Center for Stem Cells and Aging Biology and Therapeutics, focusing on
the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic potentials in the stem cell and aging fields. The two areas of
endeavor overlap extensively, one holding the promise of tissue restoration in a wide variety of disorders while
the other underlies diseases that impact everyone and leads to death. Since the start of the COBRE nine years
ago 17 junior investigators have received either full projects or pilots, with 369 research articles and cumulative
extramural funding of over $20,000,000 largely from NIH. Seven of these individuals are still funded while 13
have sustained or advanced in their academic fields, with three entering the Biotechnology field. Since their
COBRE funding, 5 have received promotions at Brown University. The main objective of the Phase 3 COBRE is
to strengthen and transition the COBRE research infrastructure into a competitive, independent and self-
sustaining academic center of excellence- the Center for Stem Cells and Aging Biology and Therapeutics in 5
years. To achieve this main objective four specific aims are proposed as follows. 1) To provide strong leadership,
structure and support to enhance translational stem cell and aging research, by providing critical equipment and
unique expertise in flow cytometry, viral construction and extracellular isolation and characterization. 2) To
facilitate and develop the Flow Cytometry, Lentivirus Construct, and the Extracellular Vesicle Cores, by
evaluating and focusing the performance of the Cores toward the goal of long-term independence, sustainability,
and regional growth. 3) To guide the Pilot Project Program in translational stem cell and aging related research,
toward extramural funding, with expert mentorship from successful local faculty through support of the
Administrative Core. 4) Enhance translational research in the Rhode Island community by encouraging and
enabling collaborations between clinicians and basic researchers at the junior and senior investigator levels. Our
vision is by sustaining and transitioning the established high caliber research infrastructure, we will enable
clinicians working side-by-side with basic research scientists, junior investigators and senior investigators, to
develop insights into diseases and disorders of stem cells and aging, leading in turn to effective clinical
therapeutic approaches."

at Rhode Island Hospital and outside of Rhode Island Hospital with expertise to support research in the field of
Extracellular Vesicle (EV). 2) To assist with EV experimental design, data collection, analysis, and storage, as
well as preparation for NIH, industry, or foundation grant submissions. 3) To enhance the collaboration and
translational research environment in the Rhode Island research community. 4) To become a financially
independent Core facility after Phase 3 of the COBRE. The Extracellular Vesicle Core instrumentation mainly
consists of two Thermo WX-40 ultracentrifuges, a Tangenx LHV tangential flow system, Applied Biosystems
ViiA™ 7 Real-Time PCR System with Twister robot, a Malvern NanoSight NS 500 with two lasers (405nm and
488nm), and a Fiber Cell Systems duet bioreactor. The Extracellular Vesicle Core is a state-of-the-art facility that
will continue to enhance collaboration and translational research in the hospital and university communities. In
collaboration with clinical doctors from Rhode Island Hospital, our Core has made significant contributions to
investigating the clinical significance of EVs as non-invasive “liquid biopsy” biomarkers for tracking the
effectiveness of disease therapy. This resulted in a $1.4 million grant in 2020 from Bristol Myers Squibb, where
approximately $350,000 was awarded to Dr. Quesenberry’s lab specifically for the Extracellular Vesicle Core.
Dr. John Reagan obtained $860,000 from Pfizer for his study of Acute Myeloid Leukemia, where EV-related
research was executed through the Extracellular Vesicle Core. Dr. Jill Kreiling got her NIH R01 in 2022, for the
study of the feasibility of using extracellular vesicles in saliva as biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease where
$60,000 per year was committed to the Extracellular Vesicle Core in the next five years. In the last three years,
the Extracellular Vesicle Core has serviced 18 projects for 22 investigators from 15 different academic
departments at five Institutions (Brown University, Rhode Island Hospital, Women and Infants Hospital, the
University of Rhode Island, and Providence VA Medical Center). These projects demonstrate that the
Extracellular Vesicle Core will continue to play a crucial role in supporting regional projects and facilitating the
basic research and the translation of novel therapeutic approaches to the treatment and prevention of disease."
10874446,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The past 20 years have seen a rapid expansion in the use of viral gene transfer vectors, with approved therapies
and late stage clinical trials underway for the treatment of genetic disorders and multiple forms of cancer, as well
as prevention of infectious diseases through vaccination. Major innovations in vector design and virus production
have been accomplished for the three most widely used viral vector systems based on adenovirus, adeno-
associated virus (AAV), and lentivirus. For laboratory investigators, cell and molecular biology methods to stably
over-express and knockout a gene in cells and tissues have become indispensable in modern biomedical
research. Lentivirus-mediated over-expression and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats
(CRISPR) knockout techniques are particularly powerful due to their efficiency and the capability of infecting
dividing and non-dividing cells. Given the significant need and demand to use these viral gene transfer
technologies and the lack of expert service providers in Rhode Island and the rest Southern New England region,
we propose a Lentivirus Construct Core for the Stem Cells and Aging (SCA) COBRE Phase 3. Our long-term
goal is to provide cutting-edge viral gene transfer technologies to the greater biomedical research community in
Rhode Island and beyond. To accomplish this goal, we propose the following 4 Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1.
To provide lentivirus technologies for easy access and efficient use. Specific Aim 2. To enhance the
competitiveness of Rhode Island investigators to secure federal research funding. Specific Aim 3. To align our
Core with translational research. Specific Aim 4. To become an independent self-sustainable service research
facility. Innovations and impact: Recombinant viral vectors are powerful gene delivery tools for cells, animal
models, and clinical applications. The lentiviral constructs from our Core will differ in their suitability for different
applications, and will allow investigators to monitor cell functions, replace, correct, express or block expression
of target genes, tag cells for fate determination, and change the physiological state of specific cell populations.
The timely development of COVID-19 pseudovirus variants by our Core was a prime example of innovation. To
genetically engineer oncolytic adenovirus encoding bispecific T cell engagers is cutting-edge, and the novel
immunovirotherapies have the potential to make a profound impact in cancer treatments. The current exponential
growth of clinical trials using AAV vectors suggests that we are only at the beginning of what is achievable for
AAV as the leading platform for gene therapies. These innovations can potentially address diseases that have
no other treatment options. In this vein, the Lentivirus Construct Core has already successfully made and will
continue to make a positive impact as a catalyst on basic and translational research to improve human health."
10850885,"The vision of the CardioPulmonary Vascular Biology (CPVB) COBRE program is to develop effective approaches
to prevent and treat vascular diseases affecting the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems through better
understanding of disease mechanisms. This will be accomplished by serving as an interdisciplinary center which
promotes collaborative research and provides excellent technical support and resources to investigators. The
overall mission of the CPVB COBRE program has been to build the human and technical infrastructure and
services that serve as catalysts to increase CPVB research in the state. Cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases
are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the US and in the world. Coronary artery disease
(CAD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Respiratory diseases are the 3rd and 4th leading causes
of death and are frequently complicated by pulmonary vasculopathy and cardiovascular co-morbidities that
markedly worsen prognosis. We have learned that infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus damages multiple organs,
with cardiovascular, respiratory, and vascular complications. Thus, there is an important need to understand the
pathogenesis of cardiopulmonary vascular diseases in order to develop more effective treatments and
prevention. The overall goal of the CPVB COBRE program is to facilitate high impact vascular biology research.
The CPVB COBRE program provides infrastructure with administrative, pilot project, and two technical cores,
thus providing opportunities to expand areas of investigation, experimental and technical approaches, and
scientific collaborations. The specific aims of Phase III CPVB COBRE are to: i) award high-impact research
projects in the area of cardiopulmonary vascular biology; ii) provide effective and high-quality services in cell
isolation and ex vivo organ function (CIOF), mitochondrial function, and in vivo imaging (MF-II); iii) collaborate
with IDeA programs in Rhode Island (RI) and other states to foster scientific networks by providing programming,
funding, technical services, and resources to enhance research productivity; and iv) maintain a robust line of
investigation in vascular biology that meets the needs of the scientific community and furthers research in
prevention and treatment of cardiopulmonary vascular diseases. Continuation of the CPVB COBRE into Phase
III will sustain the administrative structure for seminars and workshop planning, engagement, and professional
development support of investigators, and expertise in cell isolation and ex vivo organ function, mitochondrial
function, and in vivo imaging. We will expand and enrich the vascular biology research community by promoting
new collaborations and engaging scientists new to the field from a variety of disciplines. At the end of Phase III,
we expect to transition to a sustainable CPVB Center serving as a home to the CVPB research community with
high quality core services, significant institutional support, and commitment to continue the development of
effective approaches to combat or resolve cardiopulmonary vascular diseases."
10850886,"The Administrative Core
The overall goal of the CardioPulmonary Vascular Biology (CPVB) COBRE program is to facilitate high impact
vascular biology research to accomplish our vision to develop effective approaches to prevent and treat vascular
diseases affecting the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems through better understanding of disease
mechanisms. During the past 9 years, the CPVB COBRE supported 13 research project investigators and 25
pilot project investigators, who published 237 unique manuscripts, and collectively brought in ~$62.4 million
dollars on 154 grants awarded following the COBRE support. Our technical cores provided state-of-the-art
equipment and technical services. The Administrative Core held 215 seminars. The feedback from our
investigators and users shows high level of satisfaction and continued need for pilot award and technical services
in CPVB. In Phase III, the Administrative Core will provide supervision, coordination, and management of the
entire range of center activities. Activities organized by the Administrative Core will foster strong scientific
advising, a vigorous career development program, and opportunities for interaction with visiting experts and will
enhance external research funding and expansion of the scientific scope of the CPVB COBRE. The Specific
Aims are to: i) provide leadership and direction with the assistance of the steering committee and the advisory
committees, and organize and manage administrative functions of the CPVB COBRE including committee
meetings, communication with stakeholders and research community, website maintenance, data collection for
investigator tracking and evaluation, financial management, and progress reports; ii) manage activities that
enhance career development of pilot project awardees, affiliated investigators, and vascular biology research in
Rhode Island; iii) manage, prioritize, and allocate fiscal resources in support of the entire range of CPVB COBRE
activities; and iv) track and enhance CPVB COBRE services and programs based on evaluation and feedback
to facilitate the transition to a sustainable center. It is anticipated that successful accomplishment of these aims
will result in a sustainable CPVB Center with high quality technical core services, significant institutional and
extramural funding support, and commitment to continue the development of effective approaches to combat or
resolve cardiopulmonary vascular diseases and to develop the careers of faculty to become national leaders in

10850890,"Cell Isolation and Organ Function (CIOF) Core 
The central theme of the CardioPulmonary Vascular Biology (CPVB) COBRE is to facilitate high impact vascular 
biology research and enable investigators to develop insights into basic mechanisms of vasculopathies and 
translate these findings into prevention or treatment for heart, lung, and vessel diseases. An increased 
understanding of the mechanisms regulating vascularization and repair may lead to unique approaches to 
interrupt disease pathogenesis or to promote or enhance cardiopulmonary vascular and vessel restoration. The 
Cell Isolation and Organ Function (CIOF) core provides a unique skill set and expertise to Rhode Island vascular 
biologists by providing quality assurance in isolation, characterization, and propagation of vascular derived cells 
and fibroblasts and cardiopulmonary ex vivo organ function analyses. The centralization of the cell and ex vivo 
organ isolation, characterization, and function measurements has helped by standardizing technique and 
reproducibility, and in turn provided investigators the technical expertise, thus, minimizing variability and 
providing uniformity in data acquisition for CPVB investigators. The services provided by the CIOF Core have 
permitted the Investigators to focus their efforts on aspects of their research endeavors related to experimental 
design, execution and interpretation. During Phase I and II, the CIOF core assisted 78 unique users, provided 
5366 services, and performed ~$53,000 worth of services in year 9. Further, CIOF provided training for 36 
individuals and provided data analyses for 370 requests (despite pandemic shutdown). The specific aims of the 
CIOF core are to: i) offer effective and reproducible services in cell isolation and ex vivo organ function; ii) 
acquire, establish, and disseminate technologies and instrument capabilities to provide state of the art research 
tools for the scientific community; iii) work with IDeA programs in Rhode Island (RI) and other states to foster 
scientific networks and collaborations by providing technical services to enhance research productivity.; and iv) 
maintain a robust line of services that meet the research needs of the scientific community. The CIOF core will 
continue to support and enhance vascular biology research, including for new pilot project investigators and the 
scientific community, in developing, facilitating, implementing, and performing technical services to impact the 
research productivity of our IDeA colleagues and collaborators."
10850897,"The Mitochondrial Function and In Vivo Imaging (MF-II) Core
The overall goal of the CardioPulmonary Vascular Biology (CPVB) COBRE program is to facilitate high impact
vascular biology research. The CPVB COBRE has successfully supported numerous innovative studies for a
better understanding of the pathogenesis and the associated mechanisms of cardiopulmonary diseases. Over
these years, there has been increasing interest and requests from the CPVB COBRE investigators and other
scientists to perform mitochondrial function assessments and high-resolution in vivo imaging in preclinical
studies. The Mitochondrial Function and In Vivo Imaging (MF-II) Core has evolved from the Respiratory Core
that was established in 2021 as the 2nd technical core of the CPVB COBRE based on user needs. The mission
of the MF-II Core is to develop a centralized system for mitochondrial function assessments and high-resolution
in vivo imaging, with the goals to enhance productivity, promote interdisciplinary and inter-institutional
collaborations, and increase research impact of the CPVB COBRE investigators and other investigators in the
state of Rhode Island. To date, the Respiratory/MF-II Core have served 30 unique users with 4,030 services.
There is a ~2.2-fold increase in yearly technical core services from the Phase I to the Phase II. In Phase III, the
overall objective of the MF-II Core is to facilitate the scientific objectives and technical repertoire of the CPVB
COBRE Pilot Project Investigators and other Rhode Island and IDeA investigators by providing centralized
cutting-edge technologies and essential services.
The specific aims of the MF-II Core are to: i) offer effective, reproducible, and economical services in high-

10824260,"This patient safety learning laboratory (PSLL) will address the intersection of two major gaps in the science of
patient safety: 1) psychosocial patient harm / avoidable patient suffering, and 2) patient safety for transgender
individuals. It will leverage an interdisciplinary team of clinical and systems improvement experts to make an
innovative, and sustainable contribution to AHRQ’s patient safety mission. It will also address AHRQ’s call for
health services research to advance health equity. Transgender individuals are an AHRQ priority
population. We will also address intersectional impacts of transgender status by targeted recruitment from
additional AHRQ priority populations: low-income individuals, minority groups and people with disabilities.
Psychosocial harm has been largely neglected in the science and practice of patient safety, despite evidence of
its pervasive and consequential impact. The TRANS-SAFE PSLL will advance patient safety science by
identifying and addressing the systemic causes of psychosocial harm in perhaps the most vulnerable patient
population–transgender people. Because of widespread stigma, many transgender individuals live on the
margins of society, facing discrimination, exclusion, and violence. Transgender and gender non-binary (TGNB)
individuals also experience mistreatment in the healthcare system, leading to direct (psychosocial) harm and
indirect physical harm. >30% of transgender individuals report delaying or not seeking care due to discrimination,
which may lead to diagnostic delays and preventable disease progression. As a result, they experience poor
health compared to “cisgender” (non-transgender) people. This PSLL will improve patient safety for the
transgender population through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Identify the contributing factors leading to avoidable
patient suffering in transgender individuals [Problem analysis]. Apply human factors, improvement science,
risk management, and biopsychosociotechnical systems approaches to conduct a human-centered problem
analysis that identifies determinants of avoidable patient suffering in transgender individuals, including issues
such as misgendering, disrespect, abuse, and “getting lost in the system.” Aim 2: Co-design human-centered
solutions to prevent and mitigate avoidable patient suffering in transgender individuals [Design,
development]. Engage with the full range of stakeholders in an iterative process of co-design and development,
using both new and proven tools to produce interventions that address the systemic determinants of
psychosocial harm in transgender individuals. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of proposed interventions
in real and simulated and clinical environments [Implementation, evaluation]. Test the interventions
designed in Aim 2 in both actual practice settings and in simulation to evaluate effectiveness, acceptability,
usability, implementability, and sustainability. An innovative dissemination approach (a certification program
in partnership with the World Professional Association for Transgender Health) will facilitate widespread and
sustainable impact."
10842365,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
While cancer affects the entire US population, there are striking disparities in incidence and mortality across
several `priority' populations such as racial/ethnic minorities, low-income, and older adults, reflecting
differences in risk factors and access to prevention and treatments. The National Cancer Institute highlighted
the interplay of multilevel factors determining cancer outcomes in priority populations and the need for its
integration in cancer prevention and control (CPC) efforts. Thus, developing highly trained research scientists
with a multidisciplinary `mindset' and the enthusiasm and appreciation for working across disciplines to gain
new perspectives and develop innovative solutions is critical. Yet, the development pipeline for such
investigators is inadequate to match the growing burden of cancer and cancer risk in priority populations.
Our program has been highly successful in its first funding cycle with recruitment of a very diverse group of
trainees, having 100% of graduates in full-time academic CPC research careers, and 75% having already
obtained external K (or equivalent) funding. The overarching goal of the renewal of this CPC postdoctoral
research training program is to continue to launch the careers of a new generation of clinical and non-clinical
researchers prepared to apply this multidisciplinary approach to CPC research targeting priority populations.
To successfully execute this goal, the program will continue to recruit talented early career researchers who
are committed to careers in CPC research in academia, government, foundations or industry, with emphasis
on priority populations; provide multidisciplinary mentorship, guidance and individualized career development
plans to launch successful research careers for investigators from diverse backgrounds; foster appreciation
among trainees for and ability to work as part of multidisciplinary CPC research teams; and facilitate the
attainment of a research career and life skills needed to pursue and sustain long term success as independent
investigators, active participants in team science, and future leaders in CPC. Our training program's strengths
lie in the diverse CPC research portfolio at Mount Sinai, its integration in the NCI-accredited Tisch Cancer
Institute, the network of methodologically diverse and accomplished mentors, and Mount Sinai's long history of
serving the socioeconomically, racially and ethnically diverse communities that comprise its catchment
area. Our program matriculates 2 candidates each year for the 2-year fellowship, training a total of 10 new
investigators over 5 years. Each trainee develops a highly tailored curriculum rooted in 12 core competencies
needed to start a successful career in multidisciplinary CPC research targeting priority populations. Trainees
have a primary and secondary mentor(s), and their progress is carefully monitored by a Mentorship
Committee. The program receives guidance from expert internal and external advisory boards, and its
performance is regularly monitored through select metrics to ensure continued improvement and sustainability."
10834129,"This application seeks five additional years of support for the training grant on emotion research at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison. This training program continues to focus on four specific themes: 1.
Personality, temperament, and individual and cultural differences: Lifespan developmental, genetic,
cognitive and biological approaches, and human-computer interaction; 2. Affective neuroscience; 3.
Emotion, health, and wellbeing; and 4. Emotion and psychopathology. In this renewal, funds are requested
for 4 pre-doctoral and 3 post-doctoral stipends/year, the same as our current funding. At the time of the last
competing continuation, this training grant provided support for 5 pre-doctoral and 3 post-doctoral
stipends/year.
Since the time of the last competitive renewal, several additional faculty with research interests centrally in
emotion have been added; the brain imaging facility has been strengthened—the Waisman Center
Laboratory for Brain Imaging and Behavior—that is focused principally on affective neuroscience; the
innovative Center for Healthy Minds, which focuses on contemplative neuroscience and its impact on
positive affect, has continued to expand; and several major collaborative projects focused on emotion in
aging, various areas of affective neuroscience, and affective development have begun. There are now 19
program faculty, drawn from nine academic units, with Psychology as the lead department.
Pre-doctoral trainees will be supported for two years and post-doctoral trainees will be offered up to three
years of support but will be encouraged to write their own post-doctoral training proposals during their initial
year in the program to help leverage the funds we request from this T32.
Major elements of the training program include: a new 15-week Seminar in Emotion course coordinated by
Pollak and held in Fall of odd-number years, providing an overview of the range of thinking, methods, and
approaches to the study of emotion reflected among the T32 Emotion Research Training Grant faculty,
focusing primarily on the four themes upon which the program is based; a Spring seminar each year
associated with the Wisconsin Symposium on Emotion, an annual event at the University of Wisconsin-
Madison that brings 5-6 outside speakers to campus for a meeting on a specific topic in emotion research;
participation in a seminar series devoted to ethical issues in research; and participation in monthly emotion
groups held on a video-conferencing platform each month. We believe this program is unique and provides
an extraordinary opportunity for interdisciplinary training in emotion research."
10821401,"Project Title: Selectively Manipulating Intestinal Glucuronidation to Alleviate Mycophenolate mofetil-induced
Diarrhea
Abstract: Glucuronidation in the GI tract usually is a detoxification procedure for phenolic drugs used to treat
diseases on the other organs. For many of these drugs, glucuronidation in the GI tract is insufficient, resulting
in excessive drug accumulation in the lower GI segments (i.e., ileum and colon) to cause local toxicity (e.g.,
diarrhea, constipation). Our long-term goal is to develop safe and effective agents to selectively manipulating
glucuronidation in the lower GI tract to boost local detoxification without compromising plasma drug exposure
and efficacy for better therapeutic outcomes. In this application, we propose to use mycophenolate mofetil
(MMF), a prodrug of mycophenolic acid (MPA) used to prevent rejection in organ transplant patients, as the
model drug to prove the principle-of-concept. Clinical studies have shown that more than 20% of organ
transplant patients with MMF treatment suffer from chronic diarrhea, which significantly downgrades patients'
quality of lives and doubles graft loss incidence. In the preliminary study, we found that wogonin and chrysin,
two compounds that are only bioavailable in the lower GI tract due to two novel recyclings mechanisms
discovered by us recently, can effectively attenuate MMF-induced diarrhea in rats. In vitro studies showed that
wogonin can induce UGT1A, a subfamily of enzymes catalyzing MPA to be metabolized into MPA-glucuronide
(MPAG, a non-toxic metabolite). Additionally, in vitro studies showed that chrysin could inhibit UGT2B7, an
enzyme isoform catalyzing MPA to be metabolized into Acyl-MPA-glucuronide (AcMPAG, a toxic metabolite).
PK studies in rats showed that co-administration of wogonin/chrysin with MMF didn't alter the plasma exposure
to MPA, the active form for immunosuppression. Therefore, we hypothesize that selectively and
synergistically manipulating MPA intestinal glucuronidation by organ targeting agents wogonin and chrysin
could reduce local exposure to MPA and AcMPAG in the lower gut to attenuate diarrhea induced by MMF
without affecting systemic exposure to MPA. We propose two specific aims to test our hypothesis: (1) verify
the synergistic anti-diarrheal effect of Wog and Chry and develop more effective dosing regimens using cells
and animal models (Aim 1); and (2) determine the mechanism of diarrhea attenuation by Wog and Chry using
cells and animal models (Aim 2). Successful completion of this project will allow us to prove the concept of
boosting local detoxification in the lower gut using locally bioavailable compounds. Selectively manipulating
drug metabolism in a specific organ using organ targeting agents is highly innovative, thus unraveling an
important new paradigm on management of side effects in the GI tract. This project will allow the PI to
maintain and expand his innovative research in developing recycled locally bioavailable drugs. Additionally,
receiving this award will allow the PI to continuously attract and train students from different background,
especially from under-represented minority populations, with multi-disciplinary knowledge and techniques."
10845513,"Leishmania and other kinetoplastid parasites cause devastating diseases that afflict millions of people. All
kinetoplastid parasites contain a whip-like organelle, the flagellum, in all life cycle stages. Studies over
decades have underscored the vital and diverse roles that flagella play in the biology of these parasites,
including motility, attachment to the gut of insect vectors, sensing the environment, mediating mating,
interacting with internal membranes of mammalian host cells, evading the host immune response, etc. As
such, flagella are essential for both parasite colonization of and transmission through the insect vector and for
survival and virulence inside the vertebrate host. While internal components of the flagellum, such as the
axoneme, have been studied in greater detail, the surface of the flagellar membrane (FM) is poorly understood,
despite the fact that the FM mediates most of the above biological functions. To better understand the FM and
its role in parasitism, this proposal will investigate: Aim 1) how specific FM proteins traffic selectively to this
discrete component of the surface membrane; Aim 2) what the biological functions are for several selected FM
proteins. The project is founded on initial studies on the KHARON protein, that mediates FM trafficking of a
flagellar glucose transporter GT1, a trafficking machine that is essential for viability of intracellular disease-
causing amastigote stages. A molecular mechanism for KHARON in delivering GT1 to Intraflagellar Transport
particles for trafficking into the flagellum will be tested. Since most FM proteins do not depend upon KHARON
for FM trafficking, other FM trafficking machines that interact with those FM proteins will be identified by
tandem affinity purification/mass spectrometry. These novel FM trafficking machines will then be investigated,
by gene knockout approaches, for critical functions in both the insect vector and the mammalian infective
stages of the life cycle. Three selected FM proteins with known or likely biochemical functions will then be
investigated, by gene knockout, for functions in the insect vector and mammalian host stages. These studies
will reveal how specific molecular components of the FM mediate critical functions for the parasite in both the
insect vector and the mammalian host."
10810696,"Moral Injury (MI) is the lasting psychological, biological, spiritual, behavioral, and social impact of perpetrating,
failing to prevent, bearing witness to, or being the victim of acts that transgress deeply held beliefs about right
and wrong. There is widespread acceptance of and interest in MI, but this has outpaced scientific examination.
To date, the knowledge gaps are: (1) no consensus definition of the symptoms that comprise the MI syndrome;
(2) no gold standard clinical assessment measure of MI as an outcome; (3) no definition of functionally
impairing clinically significant MI; (4) no epidemiological studies of the prevalence of different types of
potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) and MI; (5) insufficient evidence that MI has incremental clinical
and explanatory validity; and (6) a lack of information about risk and resilience and the clinical care needs of
Veterans with MI. In this project, we have the following five aims: (1) to determine the US Veteran population
prevalence of exposure to different types of PMIEs. We have shown that different types of PMIEs are
associated with a unique constellation of problems. We hypothesize that non-perpetration based PMIEs (e.g.,
high stakes betrayal by trusted others) will be most prevalent; (2) to generate an optimally efficient threshold
severity score on the Moral Injury Outcome Scale (MIOS) that suggests probable functionally impairing MI.
Currently, there is no method that can be used by clinicians and researchers to determine the clinical
significance of MI as an outcome. This means that there is no way to distinguish moral frustration and moral
distress, which are common, from MI, a low base-rate clinical problem greatly affecting functioning, quality of
life, and potentially requiring treatment. A threshold score for caseness will help clinicians and researchers
screen and assess MI. We will use Receiver Operating Characteristic analyses, using upper quartile scores on
a quality of life and functioning measure as the criterion; (3) (primary) is to determine the prevalence of MI
cases and to explore prevalence by type of PMIE (we have no predictions about whether different types of
PMIEs will be associated with greater or lesser case prevalence). A secondary aim is to determine the
normative mean severity (and SD) of MIOS total and subscale scores and to explore these variables by type of
PMIEs (or no PMIE endorsement). We hypothesize that Veterans who endorse perpetration-based PMIEs will
have higher MIOS shame scores relative to those that endorse non-perpetration-based PMIEs, and vice versa;
(4) to examine the incremental validity of MI relative to PTSD and Depression, by testing the association
between MIOS scores and a measure of quality of life and functioning, relative to PTSD and depression. We
predict that MI symptoms will account for unique variance in functional problems; and (5) to conduct qualitative
interviews of randomly selected MI cases and matched Veterans who endorse exposure to PMIEs but low MI
symptoms and functional impact, to explore the PMIE and event context, as well as personal, professional,
and social risk and protective factors affecting outcomes after exposure to PMIEs. This exploratory aim is
designed to generate hypotheses about risk and resilience for MI and unaddressed targets for prevention and
treatment to mitigate the functional impact of MI in Veterans. We will accomplish these aims by conducting a
web survey of Veterans recruited from KnowledgePanel® (KP), a research panel of more than 50,000
households maintained by Ipsos. KP is the largest online panel that is representative of the US population.
Ipsos currently has ~5,000 Veterans in KP and has been conducting epidemiological surveys with Veterans for
20 years. Ipsos uses random probabilistic sampling methods, which means that results will be representative
of US Veterans. Sampling weights will be applied to inferential analyses to yield US Veteran population-based
estimates of exposure to different types of PMIEs for Aim 1 and the prevalence of MI as an outcome for Aim 3.
Aim 5 entails conducting qualitative interviews with MI cases and matched controls from the survey sample.
Data will be coded themes about the impact of PMIEs and strategies to repair MI will be extracted."
10817063,"ABSTRACT
 Our overarching goal is to elucidate the mode of action of and evaluate the therapeutic potential of the
epigenetic regulatory factor NSD3 in the regulation of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) pathogenesis. Lung
cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States and worldwide, leading to over
a 1.8 million deaths each year. LUSC is the second most common subtype of lung cancer, accounting for ~30%
of all cases and tragically over 40,000 deaths each year in the US alone. While new targeted therapies have
shown promise in other malignancies, unfortunately, to date, there are no approved targeted therapies for LUSC.
Thus, there is a major unmet need to uncover new, clinically actionable, and compelling targets for the
development of new medicines to ultimately treat this difficult disease. A central hypothesis to be tested here is
that the histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) di-methyltransferase enzyme NSD3 is a promising epigenetic target for
the treatment of LUSC. In preliminary work we found that NSD3, which is commonly amplified in LUSC, is a
major driver of LUSC pathogenesis in mouse and human models of this cancer. In our proposal, we will
investigate the role of the NSD3-H3K36me2 axis in lung cancer in vivo and explore the molecular and epigenetic
basis of NSD3-driven tumorigenesis.
 In Aim 1 we investigate the role of NSD3 in LUSC pathogenesis. We have developed novel mouse models
that recapitulate the most common genetic alterations in human LUSC, including NSD3 amplification, and
incorporated an inducible dual-recombinase approach to allow study of multi-step tumorigenesis in vivo. This
system will be used to dissect the specific functions for NSD3 in LUSC tumor initiation, progression,
maintenance, and metastatic transition using conditional NSD3 gain-of-function and knockout mice. A multistep
approach will also enable genetic validation of NSD3 as potential therapeutic target in advanced LUSC, a stage
for which new therapies are urgently needed. In Aim 2 we will elucidate the epigenetic pathways reguated by
the NSD3-H3K36me2 axis, utilizing new cutting-edge epigenomic technologies. We will also explore the role of
NSD3 in promoting intratumoral heterogeneity in human and mouse models of LUSC at the single cell level.
Together, this work will be the first to evaluate the therapeutic potential and mechanism-of-action of NSD3 in
LUSC."
10891354,"Project Summary
Lung transplantation remains the only definitive treatment for many patients with end stage lung disease.
However, the outcomes after lung transplant are meager when compared to other solid organ transplants, with
a median survival of only 6 years. The major limiting factor to long-term survival after lung transplantation is the
high incidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), a progressive form of a lung allograft failure
associated with high morbidity and mortality affecting half of all transplant recipients by 5 years. Episodes of
acute cellular rejection, a T cell mediated allo-immune inflammation of the lung allograft, are associated with
increased risk of CLAD. Our group previously showed that T cells recruited to the lung during acute cellular
rejection persist within the allograft as tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) and that these TRM migrate to the
airways, the site of tissue pathology in CLAD. The focus of this application is to identify whether lung allograft
TRM are alloreactive and how TRM may interact with their local environment to contribute to the development of
CLAD. Importantly, our preliminary data suggests that systemic immune modulators do not impact lung TRM in
the same way that they effect circulating immune cells. This application plans to advance our understanding of
how commonly used immunosuppressants, like alemtuzumab, basiliximab, glucocorticoids, and cyclosporine
impact the phenotype, function, and persistence of lung TRM compared to circulating T cells. Our research aims
include: 1) Identify the alloreactive potential of recipient-derived allograft TRM in lung transplant recipients with
and without CLAD; 2) Establish the role of lung resident myeloid cells in the maintenance of alloreactive recipient-
derived lung TRM; and 3) Determine the impact of systemic and inhaled immune modulators on lung TRM
persistence and function. The results of these investigations explore a mechanism where alloreactive T cells
contribute to CLAD and elucidate how existing immune modulators impact TRM phenotype and function.

10800733,"PROJECT 1 SUMMARY
Clostridioides difficile is a spore-forming anaerobic bacterium that is the leading cause of
hospital-acquired gastrointestinal infection in the United States.
Elderly people who have been
treated with broad spectrum antibiotics are at greatest risk for infection, although reports of
community-acquired infections in young adults are increasing. Clinically, C. difficile infection (CDI)
presents as mild to severe diarrhea and can often recur with worsening outcomes. The symptoms
result from the activity of one or more of the large toxins secreted by C. difficile: TcdA, TcdB, and
CDT (binary toxin). High serum levels of antibodies against TcdA have been linked to
asymptomatic carriage of the organism, and an acquired TcdA or TcdB immune response reduces
the risk of recurrence. These data provide the rationale for developing a toxin-based C. difficile
vaccine. While a recently completed clinical trial from Pfizer using a TcdA/TcdB toxoid did not
meet its primary endpoint, there were promising secondary indicators that suggest opportunities
for improvement in the next iteration. Project 1 will define toxin antigens that elicit robust mucosal
immune responses in humans and in mice. Our first objective will be to define the epitopes of
TcdA, TcdB, and CDT that provide effective and broadly neutralizing IgA, secreted IgA (sIgA),
and IgG responses in humans (Aim 1),
incorporating current information on TcdB sequence
diversity across C. difficile strains.
Purified monoclonal antibodies will be produced based on high-
throughput sequence analysis of toxin-specific B cell receptors from human clinical samples. The
antibodies will be evaluated for toxin binding and neutralization, and the epitopes associated with
broad, potent neutralization will be defined using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). This aim
will culminate in the creation of toxin subunits that will be evaluated for sIgA responses in patient
saliva samples. The second aim will evaluate variants of TcdA, TcdB, and CDT as immunogens
and the impact of specific toxin domains in generating protective immunity. The experimental
workflow involves a systematic approach to evaluating the potential benefits of a rectal
immunization method in the generation of robust mucosal immunity against the toxins. It will
establish an immunization regimen that can be used to evaluate defined toxin subunits and the
novel non-toxin antigens that emerge from Project 2. Finally, immunization strategies that promote
durable protection will be used to study the correlates of protection, specifically, the mucosal T
cell populations that promote robust and durable immunological memory."
10800738,"PROJECT 2 SUMMARY
Clostridioides difficile is a spore-forming anaerobic bacterium that is the number one cause of hospital-
acquired diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in the United States. The incidence of C. difficile infection
(CDI) has been rapidly rising since the 1990s and is linked to increased antibiotic use. The emergence of new
highly virulent strains over the past two decades has contributed to CDI cases spreading from elderly and
immunocompromised populations in healthcare settings, to community-acquired and zoonotic infections among
healthy adults. Although CDI is a toxin-mediated disease, vaccine trials targeting toxoids have failed to produce
effective vaccines.There is a concern that even the most effective anti-toxin strategy will not prevent the intestinal
colonization of C. difficile. Additional bacterial vaccine targets that promote immune system mediated clearance
of both vegetative bacteria and spores are needed. A strong IgA/IgG response to a conserved antigen found on
the C. difficile surface will provide the necessary target to promote a bactericidal immune response and/or by
blocking bacterial adherence and colonization within the colon. This proposal presents two aims to identify
relevant antigens and a third aim to test the new antigens for protection in a mouse immunization model. The
first approach is to use a genetic selection in a murine model to identify antigens that are selectively targeted by
the adaptive immune response. The second approach will use two biochemical strategies that will both leverage
human clinical samples from recovered CDI patients. The first of these biochemical approaches will use a
recently developed promiscuous biotin ligase to enzymatically biotinylate C. difficile antigens bound to antibodies
from the human sera. The second biochemical approach will sort patient B-cells against fluorescently labeled
C. difficile to identify antibodies that target surface proteins on C. difficile. These mABs will be characterized for
binding to C. difficile and used for antigen discovery. In both biochemical approaches we will prioritize antigens
associated with IgA class antibodies. In the third aim of this project, antigens will be assessed and prioritized.
The most promising antigens, based on multiple considerations including conservation across isolates, strength
of the identifying signals, and predicted cellular location, will be expressed and purified by Core 2. These antigens
will be evaluated for binding patient sera samples by ELISA and the most promising candidates will be evaluated
(in collaboration with Core 4) for immunogenicity and their ability to induce a protective immune response in our
pre-clinical murine vaccine mode."
10874403,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sepsis kills an estimated 11 million people worldwide every year. Sepsis also contributes to as many as 50%
of US hospital deaths. Early treatment is the only universally recognized modifiable factor for improving sepsis
mortality. Thus, current treatment guidelines focus heavily on early sepsis care immediately following hospital
presentation. However, today, little is known about even earlier, pre-hospital, opportunities to predict,
recognize, or treat sepsis. Our research program uses innovative translational informatics approaches to
elucidate the presentation, pace, and profile of infection in pre-sepsis patients that could enable novel pre-
hospital approaches designed to mitigate, or even prevent, sepsis. These pre-sepsis opportunities are now
being recognized as a key new frontier of sepsis research and care. In this renewal, we will extend successful
research that has begun to identify and characterize pre-sepsis opportunities for early, targeted intervention.
To achieve this goal, we will leverage granular electronic health record (EHR) data, advanced informatics and
artificial intelligence/machine learning methods, and the design of novel pre-sepsis care programs. Through
this proposal, we will rigorously test sepsis prediction models in key clinical subgroups, prospectively validate
the performance of pre-sepsis prediction models in real-time EHR platforms, and assess the value of additional
screening and diagnostic modalities for pre-sepsis risk stratification. Our findings will have broad and
immediate implications for patients, clinicians, and health systems to address this devastating condition. These
results will also inform the design of sepsis public health programs and future prospective interventional
studies aimed at improving outcomes for a condition that remains common, deadly, and costly."
10862780,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health emergency, responsible for 10 million new cases and 1.5 million
deaths in 2018. The Stop TB Partnership has set very ambitious targets that include a 50% reduction in TB
incidence from 2015 to 2025. Strategies to find people with active TB earlier in their disease course must
therefore be rapidly scaled up if TB control targets for 2025 are to be approached. However, active case
finding or TB is expensive and difficult to implement in practice, particularly tracing close contacts of newly
diagnosed TB cases. One innovative approach to contact tracing is to forego household visits in favor of small
incentives to the TB case and their contact for the contacts to present to the clinic for TB screening. This
proposed research is a novel study looking at barriers to implementation of incentive-based contact tracing,
refining the strategy to modify these barriers and pilot testing it in the high burden setting of rural South Africa.
We will measure acceptability, feasibility, reach, implementation and generate pilot effectiveness data which
can be used to plan for scale-up. The proposed study will be in the rural district of Vhembe, South Africa – a
district with a TB incidence of 350 per 100,000/year. We will assess barriers to implementation using
quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews with TB cases and their contacts who received the intervention
in the context of a cluster-randomized controlled trial, as well as healthcare workers. We will prioritize barriers
with stakeholders and devise a refined incentive-based tracing implementation strategy. We will pilot test this
strategy in 6 public primary health clinics within Vhembe, and examine implementation and preliminary
effectiveness. The specific aims of this research are: (1) To identify individual and systems-level barriers and
facilitators to the implementation of incentive-based contact tracing in a high burden setting; (2) To develop
and pilot test an improved contact tracing strategy. This multidisciplinary research represents an innovative
path toward achieving medium-term TB control targets in a key epidemiological setting, and can also serve as
a methodological example of how to improve real-world decision-making across a broad array of other fields in
the context of urgent and ambitious population health priorities."
10820407,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer cell genomic plasticity can enable resistance to cancer therapy for both solid tumors and
hematologic malignancy. Escape from cytotoxic or molecularly targeted therapy through an
inherent capacity to reprogram differentiation state or lineage has now been described following
adoptive cell therapy or immune checkpoint blockade in adult epithelial tumors. Transfer of T
cells genetically modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR T cells) targeting the B
cell surface antigen CD19 induces remission in 70-90% of patients with relapsed/refractory B
cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-ALL) resulting in FDA-approval for this indication. However,
a large fraction of those patients relapse within one year of treatment. This occurs with two main
patterns, 1) early antigen-positive (CD19pos) relapse, attributed to poor CAR T expansion or lack
of persistence, and 2) later antigen-negative relapse. Evasion of CD19-targeted immunotherapy
can result from loss of all B lineage phenotypic markers with acquisition of stable, alternative
phenotypes in MLL-rearranged (MLL-r), BCR-ABL driven, TCF3-ZNF384 and other subtypes of
ALL. Remarkably, emergence of phenotypic switch can occur years after CD19-targeted
immunotherapy. Understanding the mechanisms of immunotherapeutic resistance and
identifying strategies to overcome these will be critical in improving remission depth and
durability of response.
 Our proposal will address two major deficits in cancer models to identify factors
contributing to relapse from immunotherapy: the lack of immune-intact model systems that
recapitulate the lineage switching phenomenon observed using CD19-targeted immunotherapy
and the lack of faithful mouse models recapitulating infant/childhood MLL-r B-ALL. This
collaborative proposal brings together the extensive expertise of the Ernst group in the biology
of MLL-r leukemia and hematopoiesis with the CAR T cell expertise of the Fry/Kohler groups to
develop innovative new models systems to study evasion from CAR T cell therapy through
lineage reprogramming. Our preliminary CAR T cell data employs immune-intact mouse models
to illustrate that CD19neg relapse includes cells that exhibit gain of myeloid antigens and a
myeloid transcriptional profile. On the pediatric B-ALL front, we develop a retroviral system to
produce B-ALL that captures the inherent plasticity of MLL-r leukemias and switches to AML in
vivo. Our proposal assesses the ability for both leukemia-intrinsic as well as extrinsic host-
environmental components to influence escape from CAR T killing through lineage
reprogramming. The findings of our studies, including the discovery of novel strategies to block
lineage reprogramming have the potential to inform the development of similar approaches in
other forms of cancer treated with cellular therapy and, potentially, immune checkpoint
inhibitors. In addition, these studies may lead to a better understanding of lineage plasticity and
the extent to which epigenetic heterogeneity contributes to relapse, which can directly inform the
design of curative therapies.

10842434,"Epidemiological and outcomes studies in patients, as well as studies in rodent models, reveal that renal ischemic
kidney injury and unilateral obstructive uropathy brings on long-term consequences: hypertension and chronic
kidney disease. Major pathophysiological contributors include impaired renal hemodynamics, endothelial dilator
dysfunction, and endothelial cell inflammation. Because the renal microcirculation lacks efficient regenerative
capacity, acute damage to the microcirculation can lead to long-term changes in renal hemodynamics that
predispose patients to hypertension and chronic kidney disease.
A class of arachidonic acid metabolites, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) increase renal blood flow and improve
endothelial cell function. Not known is the contribution of CYP2C epoxygenases, soluble epoxide hydrolase
(sEH), and regioisomeric EETs to salt-sensitive hypertension and chronic kidney disease following obstructive
uropathy and renal ischemic injury. We hypothesize that decreased endothelial EET levels result in endothelial
dysfunction and impaired renal hemodynamics following renal ischemic injury or urinary tract obstruction.
The immediate goals of this project are to determine the ability for endothelial EETs to improve endothelial-
dependent afferent arteriolar dilation, to decrease endothelial inflammation, and to prevent salt-sensitive
hypertension and chronic kidney disease following unilateral ureter obstruction (UUO) or ischemia/reperfusion
(I/R) kidney injury. This project will utilize pharmacological as well as global and tissue-specific genetic
manipulation of CYP2C, sEH, and EETs.
We will obtain our immediate goals by completing three aims.
Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that decreased EET levels or EET function contributes to the development of salt-
sensitive hypertension and chronic kidney disease following UUO or I/R kidney injury.
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that increasing endothelial EET levels will improve renal microvascular endothelial
function following UUO or I/R kidney injury to prevent salt-sensitive hypertension and chronic kidney disease.
Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that pharmacological approaches to increase EET levels can prevent the long-term
salt-sensitive hypertensive and chronic kidney injury following UUO or I/R kidney injury.
Accordingly, our findings promise to advance the field forward by not only enhancing our understanding of the
pathophysiological mechanisms whereby UUO or I/R kidney injury leads to chronic kidney disease but also
leading to new therapeutic treatments."

Project Summary
The overall goal of this grant is to use surgically removed brain tissue and CSF from elderly patients presenting
for hydrocephalus surgery to characterize the effects of early co-morbid Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology on
these tissues and correlate these findings with clinical outcomes. Chronic hydrocephalus in the aging
population can occur for a variety of reasons, although the etiology is often unclear. In the absence of a clear
etiology, most of these cases are categorized as “Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus” (NPH). Placing a
ventricular shunt is often effective for symptom relief in the setting of NPH. At the time of shunt placement, a
cortical biopsy is often obtained at the brain entry point to look for possible coexistent brain pathology. Perhaps
not surprisingly, cortical biopsies taken from elderly NPH patients at shunt placement have been shown to
have a relatively high frequency of b-amyloid plaque pathology and occasional trace tau pathology, perhaps
because early-stage AD may be causing some of the symptoms attributed to NPH. We have recently
performed RNA-seq on 106 NPH biopsies and compared the results to histologic measures of b-amyloid and
tau and contemporaneous cognitive data. In contrast to the existing human AD autopsy literature, we identify a
homeostatic microglial module that partially replicates the decrease in homeostatic genes that is seen in the
mouse AD literature. These data suggest that our NPH biopsies are capturing some of the earliest changes in
AD physiology, and in doing so may serve as a conceptual bridge between some of the early responses seen
in the mouse literature and the post-mortem human AD literature. Motivated by these data, the goal of this
grant is to test the following three hypotheses: 1) Changes in microglial modules in our bulk RNA-seq data
reflect population shifts or changes in gene expression in microglial subtypes, 2) An evolving microglial
response in patient biopsies will correlate with alterations in CSF proteins, and 3) The microglial immune
response in patient biopsies has predictive value for cognitive decline that is different or additive to the degree
of b-amyloid and tau deposition in cortex. Completion of this project will identify CSF proteomic changes that
correlate with shifts in microglial populations and microglial gene expression changes, and place all of these
changes in the context of AD pathology density on biopsy and clinical outcomes.

The location, timing and abundance of mRNA and proteins within a tissue underlie the basic molecular
mechanisms of cell functions and physiological and pathological developments. For example, the study of
expression of thousands of genes simultaneously at different locations could reveal great insights into embryo
development, the cooperation of molecular and cellular processes for high-order mental functions, and the
molecular basis and clinical impact of intra-tumor heterogeneity. Recent technology breakthroughs in spatial
molecular profiling (SMP), including both imaging-based technologies and sequencing-based technologies, have
enabled the comprehensive molecular characterization of single cells while preserving their spatial and
morphological contexts. Due to the huge potential to deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of
cellular and physiological phenotypes, SMP technologies are rapidly gaining attention and a large amount of
such data will be generated. However, there are only few computational methods developed to analyze such
rich but complex data, and the limitations of computational methods lead to such valuable data being largely
under-used. The overarching goal of this study is to develop computational methods to analyze SMP data to
characterize detailed molecular spatial distributions and associate such information with cellular phenotypes and
physiological phenotypes. The specific aims are as follows: 1. develop novel spatio-statistical methods to
characterize spatial distributions of gene expression; 2. develop computational methods to characterize cellular
spatial organizations and investigate their relationship with molecular spatial distributions and disease status; 3.
develop user-friendly software to facilitate researchers in SMP data analysis and visualization. In order to achieve
this goal, we have assembled a strong team with complementary expertise in single-cell genomics, tissue image
analysis, spatial modelling, machine learning and software development. If implemented successfully, this
platform will greatly facilitate users in understanding molecular and cellular spatial organization in biological
tissues and provide comprehensive insights into the underlying biological processes."
10878842,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disease that causes pain, susceptibility to infection, and greatly
increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as stroke, kidney disease, and heart disease. SCD is
common in Africa because individuals with sickle cell trait (i.e., heterozygotes) are protected against severe
malaria. Unfortunately, there are now more than 235,000 children born with SCD in sub-Saharan Africa each
year. Undiagnosed, 50-90% of these children could die before the age of five years, mostly from bacterial
infections to which children with SCD are highly susceptible. Newborn screening programs across Africa need
to be expanded towards universal screening for SCD so that children born with this condition can receive
evidence-based interventions to manage pain, reduce the risk of infections, and slow the progression of
vascular diseases. To address these challenges, a pan-African sickle cell network has been established and is
supported by the NHLBI. In this proposal, we introduce a busy sickle cell treatment center based in Bamako,
Mali and explain how this center establish a registry of 4,000 patients with SCD utilizing electronic clinical data
capture, deliver consistent Standards of Care with ongoing quality assurance and quality improvement, and
conduct observational and implementation research to address the most pressing questions facing African
people with SCD.
The Centre Recherche et de Lutte contre la Drepanocytose (CRLD) is comprehensive sickle cell care center
established in 2010 that now serves more than 12,000 people with SCD. We continue to enroll 120-150 new
patients each month. We provide diagnostic services, counseling and education, as well as preventive and
acute care for people with SCD.
To establish a longitudinal cohort of 4,000 patients with SCD, we will develop data capture instruments in
coordination with the Consortium, establish new IRB-approved protocols, and begin enrolling patients at a rate
of 500 in the first year and 1,000 each subsequent year. The descriptive clinical data and biospecimens
collected on enrollment will be shared with the Consortium.
We propose delivering Standards of Care that address the most pressing needs of the SCD community.
These include (I) providing diagnosis, counseling, and education; (II) mitigating the risk of infectious disease by
providing vaccines, antibiotics and malaria chemoprophylaxis; and (III) providing hydroxyurea, an inducer of
fetal hemoglobin expression and a proven therapy for SCD, to high-risk patients.
Finally, we propose observational and implementation research studies that will lead to improved care of
people with SCD. These include (I) studying the impact of our counseling and education interventions; (II)
describing the etiologies and consequences of fever in the outpatient setting; and (III) extending malaria
chemoprophylaxis to older children.
Together, we aim to improve the care and treatment of African people with SCD both now and in the future."

The goal of this Program is to advance knowledge of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a recalcitrant
cancer with one of the highest rates of cachexia. Project 1 focuses on PDAC-induced circulating factors, including
IL-6 and its soluble receptor (sIL6R), leading to wasting of the target tissues via activation of STAT3 and NF-kB
in adipocytes and myofibers. Project 2 investigates IL-6 and NF-kB in the skeletal muscle microenvironment in
PDAC cachexia, as well as NF-kB in the tumor microenvironment and its effects on macrophages. Project 3’s
studies probe interactions of IL-6, STAT3, and NF-kB among tumor cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages in the
tumor microenvironment. Together these studies will tackle both PDAC tumor biology and the metabolic havoc
it creates for the patient. Core B will provide the Projects with unprecedented potential to interrogate the PDAC
macroenvironment by providing 1) human clinical specimens to evaluate the translational potential of their
findings, and 2) the capacity to carry out transcriptome profiling at the single cell level using single cell and single
nucleus RNAseq in matched samples from patients with PDAC, and 3) dedicated support for advanced sequence
analysis. In doing so, this Core addresses barriers that have historically limited research in PDAC and cancer
cachexia. Very few studies have reported gene expression or histological endpoints in peripheral tissues in
human cancer cachexia and even fewer in PDAC cachexia, and none have attempted to match analyses across
tissues. As well, these pioneering studies at single cell resolution in the PDAC macroenvironment of mouse
models and humans, carried out by investigators at the forefront of these technologies and analytical capabilities
will enable the Projects to make groundbreaking discoveries while contributing novel, high resolution data to the
field. The specific aims are to 1) Collect, store and distribute clinically annotated PDAC cachexia
biospecimens. Clinical data and biospecimens will be collected from PDAC surgical patients at Indiana
University Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center (IUSCCC) and from patients from the Danish PACTO Trial for
centralized compliance, processing, and distribution. 2) Carry out a single nucleus (sn) RNAseq study of the
human PDAC cachexia macroenvironment for all Projects. Muscle and adipose samples from IUSM general
surgery patients with benign conditions and muscle, adipose and tumor samples from IUSCCC PDAC surgery
patients with and without moderate cachexia will be processed to make single nuclei preparations. Batched
samples will be subjected to snRNAseq to test specific hypotheses for each of Projects 1-3 and the overall
program. 3) Provide advanced analysis of single cell (sc) and snRNAseq studies for all Projects. Core B
will provide dedicated advanced analysis of the snRNAseq data from human specimens in Aim 2 for Projects 1-
3, and of sn or scRNAseq data from mice emanating from each of the Projects 1-3. Together we will identify
targetable vulnerabilities in PDAC to promote tumor killing while sparing host tissues to preserve function,
improve quality of life and response to therapy, and ultimately increase survival for patients with PDAC."

10842265,"ABSTRACT
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fibrotic lung disease with no effective treatment. The
biological processes that underlie the persistent fibrotic repair and their molecular drivers have
yet to be fully elucidated. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-Related Non-Kinase (FRNK) acts as an
endogenous brake on lung fibrosis. FRNK is downregulated in IPF lung tissues and IPF
fibroblasts, and the extent of FRNK downregulation tightly correlates with rapidity of motility in
IPF fibroblasts. FRNK inhibits myofibroblast differentiation. Importantly, FRNK deficiency
exacerbates lung fibrosis in bleomycin-challenged mice. However, the underlying mechanism
whereby FRNK downregulation drives fibrotic responses remains unknown. Talin plays a critical
role in mechano-transduction and cell contraction through its links between integrins and cellular
contraction machinery; therefore, this link functions as the ‘Mechano-Joint’ of Talin. Our
preliminary data demonstrate that Talin plays an important role in myofibroblast survival through
its ‘Mechano-Joint’. Talin is activated in response to transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-β1)
and Talin downregulation induces myofibroblasts apoptosis. FRNK induces Talin cleavage and
myofibroblast apoptosis. We hypothesize that FRNK induces myofibroblast apoptosis through
disruption of ‘Mechano-Joint’ of Talin. Preliminary data show that FRNK downregulation
promotes activation of Crk-associated substrate (Cas) and S100A4 expression, which
contributes to an invasive fibroblast phenotype. Furthermore, preliminary data support that KH-
type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) promotes rapid FRNK mRNA decay, resulting in FRNK
downregulation in IPF. We hypothesize that pathologic FRNK downregulation by KSRP
orchestrates cooperative fibrotic signaling mediated by Talin, Cas, and S100A4, resulting in
persistent fibrotic responses in IPF. Aim 1 will define the novel role of ‘Mechano-Joint’ of Talin in
myofibroblast survival, and to examine the effects of gain of FRNK in myofibroblast on lung
fibrosis in vivo. Aim 2 will determine the mechanism whereby impaired FRNK function increases
Cas activation and S100A4 expression, and to examine the effect of gain of FRNK in S100A4-
expressing cells, on fibrogenesis. Aim 3 will determine the mechanism whereby KSRP regulate
FRNK function. These studies will support our long-term goal to utilize knowledge gained from
these studies to develop novel therapeutic approaches for IPF in humans."
10824257,"Chronic stress profoundly affects physical and mental health. Evolutionarily conserved responses to early life
stress (ELS), characterized in humans as adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), support their investigation
using animal models. Nearly 1 in 6 adults in the U.S. experience 4 or more ACEs, resulting in increased
incidence of physiological dysfunctions linked to chronic brain and multi-organ diseases. We hypothesize that
the multi-system consequences of ELS are linked to as-yet undefined genomic and functional adaptations in
vagal neurons and circuits. Vagal sensory neurons comprise a major communication route from viscera to
brain that shapes motivated behavior, metabolism, pituitary hormone secretion, inflammation, and autonomic
outflow. In concert, cortico-limbic and hypothalamic centers modulate vagal parasympathetic control over
cardiovascular, digestive, and immune-related functions. ELS is linked to reductions in vagal tone that promote
a variety of physiological dysfunctions, and our published and pilot preclinical findings in rodents indicate that
ELS induces early and persistent transcriptional and connectional adaptations in vagal neurons and circuits.
Given that vagal sensory-motor functions are integral to physiological health status, surprisingly few studies
have examined developmental and adult vagal phenotypes that contribute to disease risk in the face of ELS.
Our published and preliminary data provide the foundation for our working hypothesis that ELS triggers early
and long-term transcriptome-level molecular adaptations in vagal neurons, coupled with functional adaptations
in central vagal circuits. The proposed research begins to address this by pursuing four Specific Aims in an
established mouse model of ELS: 1) determine the early developmental and long-term impact of ELS on vagal
subclass molecular phenotypes using advanced transcriptomics strategies; 2) determine long-term ELS effects
on the transcriptional profiles of vagal neuron subtypes innervating specific digestive viscera using molecular
anatomical strategies; 3) determine early and long-term effects of ELS on the central vagal connectome using
transsynaptic viral labeling; and 4) determine long-term functional effects of ELS on vago-vagal signaling. This
research program addresses a high-impact preclinical problem through innovative discovery research that
leverages the strengths of our multi-PI research team. We include sex as a biological variable in all
experiments, based on some reported sex differences in the effects of ELS on visceral sensory-motor functions
in rodents and in humans. The proposed work will provide a novel understanding of experience-driven
developmental adaptations in interoceptive signaling pathways and visceral motor control in mice, with a
unique focus on vagal circuits that bridge central and peripheral systems at high risk for ELS-induced
dysfunction. This collaborative, multi-PI research program will provide a new platform for future mechanistic
studies probing causal links between ELS, chronic disease, and experience-driven adaptations in vagal
sensory and motor systems."
10843773,"Abstract
Ensuring a world safe from microbial threats is a pressing challenge, as outbreaks exact tolls on human health, disrupt regional security, and have the potential to rapidly escalate into global crises. In recent years, severe outbreaks of Ebola, Lassa, Zika, and other emerging viruses have illustrated how vulnerable the world is to threats from RNA viral pathogens. These public health emergencies have exposed the urgent need for improved infrastructure, scientific knowledge, and diagnostic tools in areas of the world most at risk, and underscore the need for proactive pathogen surveillance, detection, and discovery. West Africa has a disproportionate vulnerability to outbreaks, but we lack awareness of acute threats, their natural history, and effective strategies for prevention. Rooted research between local and global partners, combined with novel assays and strategies for pandemic preparedness is required to answer these questions. We will build the capacity to rapidly respond to future outbreaks by establishing the West African Research Network for Infectious Diseases. This network will expand on years of successful cross-disciplinary research and capacity building, bringing together leading researchers from the United States, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone. We will: (1) perform comprehensive surveys of acute RNA viral disease and determine critical threats circulating in hosts and reservoirs; (2) identify risk factors of virus transmission and evolution; (3) dissect pathogenesis and natural history of severe RNA viral diseases; and (4) determine diagnostic criteria for infection outcome to guide public health interventions. Our work will significantly expand research capacity in West Africa via technology development of novel solutions for surveillance, diagnostics, and pathogen discovery. By establishing our network with a focus on priority pathogen research, technology transfer, training, and capacity building, we will develop flexible strategies for detecting, mitigating, and preventing the emergence of future infectious disease outbreaks."

activities. However, UroA production in individuals can vary significantly, likely based on differences in gut
microbiota. We will substantiate the anti-cancer benefits of a prebiotic/probiotic complex derived from consuming
walnuts and determine the basis of human inter-individual variability in UroA formation.
 Our overall hypothesis is that walnut supplementation improves colonic health and lowers colorectal cancer
(CRC) risk through UroA formation. This leads to several working hypotheses guiding our Aims: Working
Hypothesis 1. UroA producers are at a lower risk of having an advanced colonic lesion; Working Hypothesis 2.
Walnut supplementation will increase urinary UroA levels; and Working Hypothesis 3. CRC prevention by
walnuts will be greater in UroA-producers than in non-producers. In Aim 1, we propose a randomized, controlled
crossover trial in 69 patients (45-75 y) to examine walnut effects on CRC risk factors. We will associate an
individual's ability to produce UroA with biomarkers of inflammation and CRC risk, and identify the bacterial
species responsible for urolithin metabolism. In Aim 2, we will investigate prebiotic effects of ET-containing
walnuts in two conditional mouse CRC models, focusing on important processes in CRC and inflammation,
including bile acid metabolism, inflammation, and short chain fatty acid production. In Aim 3, we will test the
probiotic effects of human UroA-producing microbiota in a mouse fecal microbiota transplant (MT) study and
demonstrate a causal role for specific microbes in UroA formation. This will enable us to validate the concept that
important protective effects of walnuts and other ET-rich foods occur through specific microbiota-derived
metabolites. This will also define biomarkers and probiotics that highlight the benefits of these foods. Our
approach incorporates personalized nutrition with a focus on UroA producers and non-producers in colonic
health. Ultimately, our human and pre-clinical mouse studies may lead to prebiotics and probiotics that increase
protective urolithins for CRC prevention. These highly significant studies will test the ability of the microbiota to
generate colonic mucosa-protective agents (e.g., UroA). It is possible that high-risk patients can be efficiently
converted to a protective state by taking probiotics to realize the full benefits of ET-rich foods."
10844377,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
People living with HIV (PLWH) are 28 times more likely to be diagnosed with anal cancer than the general
population. The Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with >90% of anal cancers, and is also a significant
cause of cervical, vaginal, penile, and oral cancers seen in this population. The HPV vaccine is an effective and
safe approach to prevent and reduce the risk of HPV-related disease among PLWH. However, HPV vaccination
remains low in PLWH despite formal recommendations from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices to vaccinate immunocompromised individuals up to age 26 years with the 3-dose series-- and recently
FDA approved to vaccinate up to age 45 years. The PI’s K01 serves as the rationale for this study. The PI found
significant delays in follow up care after an abnormal anal Pap test. Delays in follow up after an anal Pap test in
the absence of national guidelines to support screening in PLWH means the incidence of anal cancer will
continue to rise among PLWH, especially as this population ages. Therefore, promotion of the HPV vaccine in
this population as primary cancer prevention is a public health priority. However, the PI’s work found significant
gaps in knowledge and awareness of the HPV vaccine as well as low uptake of the HPV vaccine (13.5%) in our
population of rural PLWH. These findings support the next logical step to reduce cancer disparities as well as
further the PI’s career trajectory through promotion of HPV vaccination among PLWH as part of a successful
cancer prevention plan. However, HPV vaccine programs tailored and implemented in the HIV population is
lagging for this high-risk group. The CDC’s 4 PillarsTM Transformation Program is a multi-level, evidence-based
intervention that has been successfully utilized to increase HPV vaccination in the general population and is
primed to be tested in the high-risk HIV population, particularly PLWH in the rural South. Guided by the RE-AIM
framework, we will implement this project in three HIV clinics in Georgia and enroll n=365 PLWH who are age
18-45 years from those clinics. Aim 1) Tailor and refine the 4 PillarsTM program for implementation in rural and
urban HIV clinics in Georgia; Aim 2) Test the effectiveness of the 4 PillarsTM program as measured by an increase
in uptake rate in initiation of the HPV vaccine (primary endpoint) and vaccine completion (secondary endpoint)
compared to historical baseline vaccination rate (control) among PLWH; Aim 2.1) Identify mediators and
potential moderators of the intervention effects on HPV vaccination; Aim 3) Assess the sustainability of the
intervention in vaccine uptake post-intervention; Aim 3.1) Assess scalability of the program for wider
implementation via a future national RCT. As an Early-Stage Investigator, the PI (Wells) has assembled an
outstanding research team that brings complementary expertise to successfully execute the aims of this research
proposal. The proposed study is a novel approach to address a serious and preventable public health problem
by using an efficacious, evidence-based intervention on a new target population. The findings are anticipated to
have a significant impact in the field of improving cancer outcomes in a high-risk and aging HIV population."

In the majority of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), one or more proteins aggregate over the course of disease progression. In the case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), AD, and other AD-related dementias (ADRDs), cytoplasmic inclusions of transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) are observed in a large percentage of patients with sporadic and familial forms of disease. This aberrant accumulation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 is thought to underlie gain of toxic functions and exacerbate loss of nuclear function pathogenic mechanisms; therefore, preventing the formation or promoting the clearance of these inclusions may be an effective therapeutic approach for TDP-43 proteinopathies, such as AD and ADRDs. Currently, there are no therapeutics that effectively alter the course of most neurodegenerative diseases associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy. We have recently identified Nemo-like kinase (Nlk) as a negative regulator of the lysosome, a key organelle involved in cellular protein quality control that is capable of clearing toxic aggregated proteins. This proposal aims to better understand the basic molecular mechanism of Nlk’s regulation of lysosome gene expression in the nervous system and to test the modulatory effects of Nlk in ADRD animal models of TDP-43 aggregation. We propose the following three specific aims. Aim 1 will employ unbiased and targeted approaches to uncover fundamental mechanistic insights into the regulation of lysosome gene expression by Nlk in neurons. Aim 2 will determine which cell types mediate the function of Nlk in the regulation of the lysosome and TDP-43 proteinopathy in the nervous system in vivo using wild-type and TDP-43 animal models. Aim 3 will expand the scope of the proposed study to understand the therapeutic implications of Nlk reduction in animal models of TDP-43 aggregation through genetic and pharmacological reduction of Nlk levels at varying times in adulthood in vivo. In doing so, we will test the effect of Nlk reduction in the control of the onset and progression of pathological and motor behavioral changes in TDP-43 mouse models of ADRD. Aims 2 and 3 will provide critical proof-of-principle evidence regarding the effectiveness of lysosomal modulation in pre-clinical models of protein aggregation disorders. Together, this project will reveal novel molecules involved in lysosomal regulation in neurons that may be potential targets in the treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and several AD-related disorders."

Type 1 diabetes affects millions of individuals globally, and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.
The autoimmune process behind this disease is not fully understood, complicating attempts to prevent or cure
it. Islet transplantation is a potentially curative approach, but remains hindered by numerous adverse
complications, including lifelong immunosuppression required after the procedure. Thus, the objective of this
grant is to investigate an immunomodulatory approach for mitigating autoimmunity, with the goals of better
understanding the aberrant immune response in type 1 diabetes and contributing to an improved therapeutic
approach for islet replacement. Cancers and pathogens have been noted to upregulate sialyltransferases and
engage inhibitory Siglec receptors to dampen immune rejection. Previous studies in the lab found that islet
resident macrophages express the inhibitory Siglec-E receptor, which binds sialic acid residues generated by
the sialyltransferase ST8Sia6. This leads to the central hypothesis that induced ST8Sia6 expression in the
beta cells of the islet can protect against autoimmune rejection. To test this, we have developed a novel
mouse on the non-obese diabetic background that expresses ST8Sia6 in a beta cell specific manner, and have
shown robust protection from disease. The central hypothesis will be addressed in two specific aims. The
mechanistic basis of protection from spontaneous and induced autoimmunity will be explored. Immune profiling
via flow cytometry will help elucidate the cellular and molecular events protecting from autoimmune activity.
This project recognizes the complex dynamics of the immune response and considers both innate and
adaptive mediators of autoimmunity in investigating a novel immunomodulatory path. Additionally, the potential
therapeutic applications of this work will be tested. Our genetic model includes a tetracycline-off parameter,
allowing for temporal studies investigating the minimum required time of ST8Sia6 expression for robust
protection or the ability of ST8Sia6 to alter the autoimmune disease process once initiated. We will also employ
novel islet transplantation models to determine whether ST8Sia6 expressing beta cells can restore glycemic
control without immunosuppression. Ultimately, this work will contribute to improved understanding of
autoimmunity and a potentially tissue-intrinsic approach to avoid immune rejection."
10878712,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Each year more than 700,000 patients survive an episode of acute respiratory failure (ARF) that required
endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation. Occurring in as many as 44% of these ARF survivors,
post-extubation aspiration is associated with deleterious consequences including pneumonia, percutaneous
feeding tube placement, long term care facility admission, and increased hospital mortality. Nevertheless, the
complications of aspiration must be weighed against the consequences of inappropriately delaying the
resumption of oral feeding. Delayed resumption of oral nutrition is associated with prolonged enteral tube
feeding, increased caregiver burden, patient dissatisfaction, and increased health-related costs. With the
support of an NINR R21 award, our multidisciplinary and multicenter team discovered three novel findings: 1)
we developed a 5-item screening decision tree algorithm that detects patients at high risk for post-extubation
aspiration; 2) we identified certain unique upper airway abnormalities that are associated with post-extubation
aspiration and dysphagia; and 3) the size of the endotracheal tube (ETT) is independently associated with
post-extubation aspiration. This proposal will continue to utilize our robust and established multi-center
research group at Colorado, Boston University, Stanford, and Yale; all of whom have long-standing dysphagia
and aspiration research groups focused on ARF. We will conduct a multi-center cohort study with three
complementary aims that are interrelated and use the same patients; but are not dependent upon the results of
each other. Aim #1 will determine whether our 5-item decision tree algorithm is a more effective screening tool
to identify patients at high risk for post-extubation aspiration compared to the three-ounce water swallow test
(3-WST) and the Toronto Bedside Swallowing Screening Test (TOR-BSST). These results will establish the
optimal screening test for post-extubation aspiration and identify those patients who require further invasive
diagnostic testing such as a FEES examination. Aim #2 will identify unique subphenotypes of patients with
post-extubation aspiration based upon FEES-related measures of upper airway structure and function. Using a
novel latent class analysis, we will determine whether these subphenotypes are associated with different
trajectories of recovery and identify unique patients who benefit from different personalized and targeted
therapies. Aim #3 will determine the association between ultrasound determined ETT size/tracheal diameter
ratio and post-extubation aspiration while accounting for other confounding variables. This aim will identify the
most effective method to select the ETT size that optimizes ventilatory management and decreases post-
extubation aspiration. The results of this aim will pave the wave for dramatic improvements in the intubation
process for all ARF patients who require mechanical ventilation. With an innovative and protocolized approach,
the results of this proposal will demonstrate novel methods to minimize post-extubation aspiration, transform
the multidisciplinary care of ARF survivors, and improve patient outcomes and quality of life."
10835900,"ABSTRACT
Unintended pregnancy is a major contributor to maternal and infant mortality in low-income countries (LICs).
More than 300,000 women and 2.7 million newborns die every year in LICs due to complications from
childbirth and pregnancy. Nearly half of the 200 million pregnancies occurring annually in LICs are unintended.
High numbers of unintended pregnancy are primarily the result of non-use of contraception. Non-use of
contraception is more likely to occur among potential users who experience poor provider care. Providers who
are frequently absent, solicit informal payments from clients, and deny methods to unmarried or nulliparous
women are a major barrier to women seeking family planning. Yet, removing these barriers is difficult due to
low supervision and accountability in under-resourced public facilities. Such findings highlight the need for
interventions that increase quality of care via alternative mechanisms for monitoring providers. The social
accountability approach solicits citizen feedback with the goal of improving provider performance and service
delivery. To date, there is limited rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of social accountability interventions to
increase contraceptive use and on the conditions necessary for successful and sustainable scale-up of these
interventions. Further, no prior study has rigorously assessed social accountability in a setting where Universal
Health Coverage (UHC) is already operating. Based on these knowledge gaps, we propose to evaluate the
impact of two social accountability interventions using rigorous methods. We propose this study in Kenya,
which rolled out UHC in late 2018 and where one out of every 42 women will die from complications related to
pregnancy and childbirth. This study seeks a) to implement the Community Score Card and the Citizen Report
Card, b) to evaluate the impact of each of these interventions on contraceptive use, quality of care, and
community engagement within communities in Kisumu County, Kenya, and c) to assess the potential for
sustainability in additional counties in Kenya, using implementation science methods. To evaluate the impact of
the Community Score Card and the Citizen Report Card on our outcomes of interest, a three-armed cluster
randomized controlled trial will be conducted in Kisumu, Kenya, with all public-sector facilities randomly
assigned to one of three study arms: 1. Community Score Card intervention, 2. Citizen Report Card
intervention, or 3. control sites. Outcomes will be assessed via pre- and post-intervention surveys at the
individual (n=2268) and facility levels (n=129). Implementation science methods will be used to assess the
quality, scalability, and replicability of both the Community Score Card and the Citizen Report Card for uptake
by the public-sector healthcare system. Specifically, in-depth interviews will be conducted with community
members and service providers (n=30), and focus groups (n=4) will be conducted with key intervention
facilitators to assess implementation challenges. This research project will develop an evidence base and
implementation strategy for effective community monitoring of publicly funded healthcare facilities in LICs."

across each clinical site – University of South Carolina (UofSC), MUSC, Johns Hopkins University (JHU), and
University of California Irvine (UCI).
During the current phase of C-STAR, the DCU has provided data management for all data collection on the
project and will continue to do so if the current proposal is funded. The DCU has been instrumental for the
success of the current trial and will aid in collection, coordination, storage, analyses, and dissemination of all
behavioral data.
The Administrative Core will continue to be responsible for coordinating communication across research cores
and projects. This includes scheduling meetings at appropriate intervals to discuss progress, coordinate similar
activities across different sites, and if needed, solve problems. These meetings focus on resolving
discrepancies in data entry and to modify data collection efforts to best fit the long-term goals of the project.
The Administrative Core supervises coordination of all meetings, including setting meeting agendas and
recording meeting minutes. To coordinate meetings across sites, we will continue to rely on conference
services provided by GoToMeeting™ (www.gotomeeting.com)."
10618128,"BACKGROUND: Veterans are at elevated and increasing risk for suicide, relative to civilians. In particular,
female Veterans are nearly twice as likely to die by suicide, compared to female civilians. In addition, 70% of
Veterans who died by suicide did not use any Veterans Health Administration (VHA) care in the year before
death. Consequently, female and non-VHA Veterans have been identified as two target populations in the VA
National Strategy for Veteran Suicide Prevention. Yet most suicide prevention research has focused on VHA
users and male Veterans. Knowledge is thus limited regarding whether VHA and non-VHA users differ with
respect to who dies by suicide, precipitating circumstances of death, and regarding gender differences within
these domains. Moreover, while mental health (MH) care offers an important opportunity to recognize and
intervene upon suicide risk, knowledge is limited regarding barriers to accessing MH or suicide-specific care,
particularly in relation to whether these differ by gender or VHA use. These gaps preclude determining the most
effective and patient-centered means of preventing suicide among both female and male Veterans, particularly
those who not using VHA care. SIGNIFICANCE/IMPACT: The present study has strong implications for
understanding and preventing suicide among non-VHA users and female Veterans, both of whom have been
vastly understudied. This is particularly crucial considering: (1) the 2016 Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act,
which directs VA to determine the most satisfactory and effective MH and suicide prevention programing for
female Veterans; and (2) the 2019 Executive Order on a National Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End
Suicide, which directs VA to work side-by-side with communities to reduce suicide among all Veterans, not only
those using VHA services. This study will increase knowledge of female and male Veterans who died by suicide,
including circumstances surrounding death, and the extent to which suicide decedents accessed MH care prior
to death. Such knowledge can be garnered to tailor prevention efforts across Veteran groups. Moreover, by
engaging with living Veterans, this study will improve understanding of Veterans’ experiences and willingness to
seek MH care in general and when suicidal, while also informing the extent to which their experiences, barriers,
and preferences differ by gender and VHA use. This knowledge is timely and critical as VA seeks to engage
more Veterans in care. INNOVATION: This study will be the first to identify factors differentiating VHA and non-
VHA suicide decedents and to explore female and male Veterans’ experiences and preferences for seeking help
when suicidal. This study is also innovative in conceptualizing non-VHA users as comprising Veterans who were
lost-to-care and who never used any VHA care. SPECIFIC AIMS: This study uses mixed-methods to compare
three groups of Veterans (VHA users, never users, and lost-to-care) across three aims: (1) Identify factors that
differentiate Veteran suicide decedents (e.g., circumstances of death, MH care use); (2) Examine differences in
willingness to seek MH care, barriers to using MH care, and MH care experiences; and (3) Describe and compare
Veterans’ experiences, preferences, and barriers to help-seeking when suicidal. Gender differences will be
examined across aims. METHODOLOGY: For Aim 1, probabilistic linkage of data from national sources will be
combined for Veteran suicide decedents to evaluate circumstances of death (e.g., interpersonal and
socioeconomic stressors, MH problems), as well as VHA MH care use (for VHA and lost-to-care decedents). For
Aim 2, Veterans will be surveyed about their willingness to seek MH care, barriers to doing so, and MH care
experiences. For Aim 3, qualitative interviews will explore Veterans’ experiences, barriers, and preferences for
seeking help when suicidal. Female Veterans will be oversampled. IMPLEMENTATION/NEXT STEPS: Intended
impacts include greatly enhancing knowledge and facilitating new opportunities for implementing patient-

10839767,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Diabetes mellitus is associated with multiple complications including diabetic gastroparesis. The systemic
effects of diabetes modify all cells in the body but in common with other diabetic complications, gastroparesis
does not develop in all patients. Delayed gastric emptying (GE) in the absence of obstruction defines
gastroparesis and also occurs in some but not all diabetic mice. These observations suggest that together with
genetics, convergence of systemic changes with local factors is necessary to develop delayed GE in diabetes.
We previously have found that delayed GE that is associated with loss of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), which
in turn is associated with fewer CD206+ muscularis propria macrophages (MPMs). MPMs play a central role in
modifying the cellular content and biological environment of the GI muscularis propria in health and disease.
The source of gastric MPMs and the mechanisms for activation of injurious molecules in MPMs by diabetes are
not known. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that the underlying central determinant of delayed
gastric emptying in diabetes is the combination of a programmed activation response evoked in
monocytes and the tissue environment of new monocyte-derived MPMs in the gastric muscularis
propria. This will be tested in three specific aims (SA). SA1 will determine the effect of diabetes on circulating
monocytes that primes them for infiltration and activation in gastric muscularis propria. SA2 will determine the
origin of activated MPMs that populate the gastric muscularis propria following onset of diabetes and SA3 will
determine how newly established and activated MPMs cause cellular injury in the diabetic stomach. The SAs
are supported by extensive preliminary data. 1) We have found that systemic exposure to diabetes modifies
the epigenomic landscape of circulating monocytes so that monocytes are poised to express a restricted
complement of signaling pathways when they enter the tissue and become MPMs; 2) MPMs in the diabetic
stomach are derived from infiltrating monocytes; 3) Diabetes results in the presence of new, distinct, discrete
types of MPMs that are unique to the tissue; 4) Lineage-tagged, long-lived MPMs are not changed by diabetes;
5) Disruption of cellular metabolism in the gastric muscularis propria by diabetes activates monocyte-derived
MPMs in close apposition to ICC to produce injurious cytokines, which cause damage to ICC and disrupted
gastric function. To address the overall hypothesis we have developed techniques to isolate identified MPMs
and monocytes, applied highly sophisticated technology for profiling genes by single cell RNASeq, ATAC-Seq,
and proteins by mass cytometry (CyTOF), and determined changes in the epigenomic landscape in innate
immune cells based on phenotypes identified in single cell studies. The preliminary data and the proposed
experiments position us to identify the key steps that determine the responses to diabetes in innate immune
cells that result in development of delayed GE. The new knowledge gained will be crucial to direct targeting of
the mononuclear phagocyte system for prediction, prevention and treatment of diabetic gastroparesis."

health record (EHR) data and will include continued curation and validation of complex phenotypes using
innovative analytics. [The specific aims of this research in older Veterans are to: 1) Assess determinants of HF
risk and prognosis after HF diagnosis in a VA Healthcare facility, 2), Assess determinants of AF risk and
prognosis and 3) Assess determinants of Stroke risk and prognosis.]
 [During the previous funding cycle, we leveraged the VA’s large scale national longitudinal EHR data,
linked to additional data sources including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the
National Death Index (NDI) to create a comprehensive cardiovascular database. Data curation for traditional
RFs, ASCVD preventive therapies, and several ASCVD outcomes was also completed in the previous funding
cycle. Our new proposal will include continued data curation to include novel RFs, such as red cell indices,
white blood cell indices, obstructive sleep apnea, frailty, alcohol intake, aortic stenosis, medication use, lifestyle
factors, and blood measures [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum albumin]. We will achieve this
by employing high-throughput probabilistic phenotyping and multimodal and network data modeling. Outcomes
and risk factors will be evaluated over time where appropriate.]
 Electronic health record (EHR) data will be used to identify a baseline index date for Veterans based on
an outpatient VAMC visit at which time the Veteran had blood assayed for traditional lipids. Information from
the baseline and follow up visits will be obtained with database programming and will include: age, sex, systolic
BP, diabetes status, cholesterol, HDL-C, TG, and CVD preventive medications. Filtering algorithms will be
used for laboratory measures across the different hospital laboratories, as has already been undertaken by this
research team. Similarly, BMI, glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measurements, and vascular disease
ICD-9/10 codes will be added.
 [Incidence and prognosis of HF, AF, and stroke will assess the role of established and novel risk
profiles. Outcomes to be analyzed include myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause
mortality. For HF we will also examine HF hospital admissions and HF re-admissions within 30 days of
diagnosis. We will compare currently published algorithms for the three conditions where appropriate and
compare the results to our own developed regression models that include novel RFs using mediation analyses
and reclassification strategies where appropriate. We will also report county- specific mapping of outcomes.]"
10854981,"Abstract: The alarming rates of obesity among children and adults, particularly among ethnic minorities, has
been identified by the National Institutes of Health as one of the most serious public health challenges facing
our nation in the 21st century. South Carolina (SC), part of the “Stroke Belt,” has the 3rd highest obesity rate
among US children at 39.2% and the 12th highest obesity rate among US adults at 32.3%. Unfortunately,
African Americans in SC are disproportionately more likely to be overweight or obese (75.7% of adults, 40% of
children), which places them at considerable high-risk for obesity-related diseases such as asthma, Type 2
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, stroke, and some forms of cancer. This public health challenge
is compounded by the lack of available intervention strategies specially tailored to meet the unique needs of
ethnic minorities. This R01 randomized clinical trial, informed by the results from a recently completed
NHLBI/NICHD center grant (“FIT Families Project,” U01HL097889; PI-Naar) that followed the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute, Obesity Related Behavioral Intervention Trials (ORBIT) model for developing
behavioral interventions, will examine the efficacy of FIT Families compared to a credible attention control
condition. Each of four evidence-based behavioral components of FIT Families (home-based services,
contingency management, motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral skills training) were culturally tailored
and optimized through a proof of concept sequential multiple randomized trial that produced weight loss among
African American adolescents, a large and understudied population. One hundred and eighty obese African
American adolescents aged 12-17 and their primary caregiver will be randomly assigned to one of two
treatment conditions: 1) FIT Families or 2) Home-Based Family Support (HBFS) attention control condition. It
is predicted that FIT Families will lead to greater reductions in adolescent and caregiver percent overweight,
and increases in physical activity and the use of evidence-based weight management behaviors (self-
monitoring of diet and exercise). If effective, FIT Families, which was carefully developed and adapted through
successive Phases of ORBIT, has the potential to reduce disparities in obesity-related diseases
(cardiovascular and metabolic) by addressing multiple risk factors among African American families and their
adolescent children. Thus, this project has high significance in terms of potential public health impact and
reduction in obesity related healthcare costs."
10841610,"Project Summary
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by pathogenic bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is causing significant
morbidity and mortality to humans across the world. Live, attenuated M. bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG),
is the only TB vaccine currently licensed by the World Health Organization for use in humans. Although BCG
prevents severe disease in children with variable efficacy, it fails to protect against pulmonary TB in adults, who
are the primary source of transmission of Mtb in the community. Moreover, BCG may cause disease in immune-
compromised individuals, such as those co-infected with HIV. To control the development of active disease and
to break the chain of Mtb transmission, a new, safer and more effective vaccination approach is urgently
required. The development of “paradigm-shifting” protective measures against TB will significantly be aided by
the optimization of safe and effective combinatorial platforms, such as integrating novel vaccines with adjunct
host-directed therapy (HDT) and/or antimycobacterial drugs. This strategy is aimed at inducing appropriate
innate immunity along with potent and durable T cell responses, both of which are necessary for effective control
of TB. Such an integrated approach is urgently needed to control the pathology of active, cavitary TB cases and
transmission of Mtb, as well as to prevent reactivation of latently infected individuals, estimated to be about a
quarter of the world population, who are Mtb-infected and mostly asymptomatic but can reactivate the disease
upon immune suppression. Selection and usage of a relevant animal model that recapitulates the
pathophysiology of cavitary TB, as seen in humans is vital to screen novel and better intervention strategies to
combat the disease, including potent vaccine and drug candidates. We have established a rabbit model of
aerosol Mtb infection that mimics the range of human manifestations of pulmonary TB, from cavitary
(transmissible) disease to latent infection. Dr. Subbian has established a rabbit model of cavitary TB and the
sub-award PI, Dr. Kupz has developed a tractable and reproducible mouse model to study the reactivation
dynamics of latent Mtb infection following the loss of CD4+ T cells as it occurs in HIV co-infected individuals.
Using these two models, we propose to determine the ability of a novel recombinant BCG strain (BCG::ESAT-
6-PE25SS developed in Dr. Kupz lab), in combination with mTOR inhibitor (everolimus) and/or two first-line
antibiotics, isoniazid and rifampicin, to protect against progression to cavitary TB (rabbit) and/or induce
sterilizing immunity in latency (mice). To compare our approach, we will test individual components in these
model animals. We will also define mucosal (lung) and systemic (blood) immune parameters that predict
protection against Mtb challenge in our model system. The results of these studies can contribute towards the
development of new generation vaccine platforms for targeting other intracellular pathogens, in addition to Mtb."
10840422,"Inter-organ signals that regulate body size, physiology and developmental timing
 Identifying and characterizing physiologic mechanisms that regulate organ
communication and function during development and adulthood is vital for understanding
how many important human health problems arise and intensify during our lifetimes.
This proposal outlines a research strategy to further characterize key signaling systems
that regulate critical and conserved physiological processes. These include determining
how a signaling network of three Drosophila Activin-like members of the TGF-beta
superfamily coordinately control fundamental aspects of brain, muscle, and fatbody
cellular function in response to environmental variables such as nutrition during
development to maintain physiologic homeostasis and how neuroendocrine mechanisms
regulate steroid production and release, also in response to various internal and external
cues, to properly time developmental maturation. We will use a wide variety of modern
biological investigative methods including genetic analysis, neuronal circuit and activity
mapping, biochemistry, optical/EM imaging, metabolomics, temporal and tissue specific
transcriptome characterization as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, to
answer these questions. Impact on human health: The successful completion of these
aims will provide novel insight into how an two very conserved inter-organ signaling
networks parse out specific, as well as combinatorial control, over various fundamental
cellular processes to produce a properly proportioned animal, that is optimized for
survival in its particular ecological niche. It is expected that this knowledge will provide
useful paradigms for understanding functional aspects of the more complex, but highly
related vertebrate TGF-beta and neuroendocrine signaling systems, and will afford novel
insights into molecular mechanisms that contribute to a number of human disorders
including obesity, metabolic syndrome, muscle wasting, pubertal disorders and ageing."

The uterus in women is a unique organ in its ability to undergo repeated physiological damage and repair during
the monthly menstrual cycle. The endometrium, in particular, is extensively regenerated following menstrual
shedding. Our long-term research goal is to understand the normal mechanisms of endometrial regeneration
and repair and how these processes, when mis-regulated, contribute to diseases/dysfunction such as
endometrial cancer, endometriosis, thin endometrium, Asherman’s Syndrome and infertility. In this project,
experiments are designed to investigate mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) as a mechanism of
endometrial epithelial regeneration. Research shows that MET is one mechanism by which the endometrial
epithelium is regenerated postpartum and in a menses-like model in mice and has been proposed as a
mechanism in women. During MET, which is a type of cellular transdifferentiation, a mesenchymal cell is
reprogrammed and converted into an epithelial cell. To our knowledge, the endometrium is the only tissue that
uses cellular transdifferentiation under normal physiological conditions (e.g. postpartum and menses-like repair)
in the adult. Unfortunately, our understanding of this unique repair mechanism is very incomplete. Two specific
aims will further investigate MET in epithelial regeneration: (1) Test the function of MET-derived endometrial
epithelial cells; and (2) Compare MET by endometrial-derived and bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal
cells. A combination of mouse models including lineage tracing, menses-like endometrial breakdown and repair
and a novel orthotopic transplantation technique along with scRNA-seq will be employed to address fundamental
questions about the function, characteristics, and origin of MET-derived epithelial cells. Particularly, whether they
are bona fide endometrial epithelial cells and whether they originate from endometrial stromal cells and/or bone
marrow cells, will be investigated. Importantly, orthotopic transplantation will be used to assess MET by human
stromal cells as in vivo studies cannot be performed in women. Proper endometrial regeneration, including
replacement of lost or damaged epithelial cells, is necessary for preparation of the uterus for subsequent
reproductive cycles and pregnancy. No other organ is subject to such extreme tissue regeneration as that seen
in the uterus during the menstrual cycle. It is perhaps because of the extent of damage and repair that the uterus
undergoes that it is subject to development of diseases. Increased understanding of endometrial repair
mechanisms will provide greater insight into how these processes, when gone awry, contribute to endometrial
diseases and impact fertility ultimately leading to better therapeutics."

 “Immunotherapeutic targeting of MIF-dependent chaperone activity”
 Metabolic reprogramming that favors mitochondrial respiration plays an important role in controlling
differential gene expression patterns in myeloid lineage cells. Our recent findings have identified a novel protein
chaperone-dependent pathway that indirectly controls mitochondrial homeostasis and metabolic programming
that are needed to drive maximal intratumoral myeloid cell immune suppressive phenotypes. Our hypothesis
predicts that small molecule inhibition of this chaperone activity, carried out by the multifunctional cytokine MIF,
induces spontaneous Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) misfolding and aberrant mitochondrial binding
leading to metabolic reprogramming and subsequent phenotypic reversion of intratumoral myeloid cell immune
suppressive phenotypes into immune stimulatory phenotypes. Studies proposed in this application will: 1)
Delineate the mechanisms of action of 4-IPP-based MIF chaperone inhibitors in the context of MIF/SOD1-
dependent TAM/MDSC polarization; 2) Determine the relative contribution of hypoxia as a physiologic ER
stressor that exacerbates myeloid wt SOD1 misfolding in the context of MIF and 4-IPP, and 3) Evaluate the
therapeutic potential of lead MIF chaperone antagonists as individual and combinatorial modalities against
established metastatic melanoma."

The Boston University Clinical HIV/AIDS Research Training (BU-CHART) program prepares outstanding M.D
and Ph.D. trainees for careers as scientific leaders in HIV/AIDS research, with a focus on research in
disadvantaged and underserved populations. BU-CHART focuses its training plan on four high-priority HIV
research fields that address the substantial challenges that remain to ending the HIV epidemic: 1) substance
use and HIV - a syndemic of substance use disorders and HIV infection fuels HIV outbreaks in the U.S.,
Eastern Europe, and Asia. 2) Tuberculosis and HCV co-infection - comorbidities, including Tuberculosis and
Hepatitis C Virus are leading causes of death among HIV-infected people; 3) HIV transmission and
establishment of latency - HIV incidence remains stubbornly elevated, and early establishment of HIV latency
remains a frustrating puzzle that limits progress to finding HIV cure; 4) HIV treatment and the accelerated
aging process - we still seek safe and effective interventions to reduce the inappropriate immune activation that
accompanies HIV infection and leads to end-organ disease. The training facilities include state-of-the-art
research space at Boston University Schools of Medicine and Public Health and Boston Medical Center, the
largest Safety-net hospital in New England. BU-CHART synergizes with existing training programs on campus,
including the BU Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI), the Providence-Boston Center for AIDS
Research, and other T32- and R25-funded training programs on the BUMC campus. We pair our outstanding
trainees with BU-CHART faculty mentors who are established investigators with NIH-funded research projects
and experience mentoring. We provide a thoughtfully constructed training plan in scientific reasoning and
experimental design, professional development, and the ethical conduct of human research. The result is a
track record of training success. In the past 15 years, BU-CHART trained 26 MD and PhD post-doctoral
fellows, of whom 20 (77%) remain in in academic positions focused on HIV research. Among the 7 trainees
who completed the program in the current grant cycle, 6 now have academic research positions, 3 have
already obtained career development awards, and 2 have career development awards currently under review."
10850514,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that impacts approximately 1.5% of
children in the United States. Individuals with ASD experience deficits in social communication or restricted
interests and repetitive behavior; but the severity and patterns vary greatly and convey lifelong impairment for
some. It is unclear how the presentation of ASD changes from early childhood into adolescence or adulthood.
The causes of ASD are also unknown, though substantial evidence supports the contribution of both genes
and environmental factors. These gaps in knowledge exist because US studies to date have lacked the
sample size, depth of data collection, or appropriate life course timing to address these questions. The Study
to Explore Early Development (SEED) is now able to address these prior limitations. SEED is a large case-
control study of children ages 2-5 years and their families, implemented across eight states over three phases.
SEED collected detailed data on children's core ASD symptoms, cognitive status, and presence of co-
occurring conditions in early childhood, along with extensive risk factors related to maternal health and the
perinatal environment as well as genomics. The SEED sample includes 2044 children with ASD, 1950 children
with non-ASD developmental disabilities (DD), and 2285 population control children (POP), making this the
largest etiologic study of ASD in the US. Recent ancillary studies - the SEED Teen Pilot and SEED COVID
studies -- will soon add data on adolescent health and the consequences of the pandemic, respectively, for
some SEED participants. The work proposed here, SEED Follow-up Studies (SEED FU), will maximize the
impact of extant SEED data through analyses that characterize ASD phenotypes and assess the potential
interplay between genetic and modifiable risk factors. SEED FU will also facilitate new data collection in
middle childhood, adolescence and early adulthood to characterize changes in ASD phenotype across
developmental stages, and the associated health, educational, and service needs across the early life course.
These data will further enable prospective analyses of associations between early life factors and later
childhood through early adulthood outcomes. Studying risk factors in relation to life course phenotypic
subgroups may also help elucidate etiologies previously masked in ASD case-control studies. The NC SEED
Team in combination with the SEED Network's collaborative infrastructure and extensive extant data
resources, will ensure the successful implementation of the SEED FU Study in North Carolina and contribute to
success across the network. SEED is well-powered for making significant contributions to our understanding
of the complex autism phenotype and identifying factors associated with ASD risk in the population. The
knowledge gained by SEED FU will greatly advance our ability prevent adverse developmental outcomes and
to support individuals with ASD and their families to ensure optimal wellbeing through early adulthood."

Chitotriosidase (chitinase 1; Chit1) is the major true chitinase in humans. It can be found in the circulation of
normal individuals and is further increased in a variety of diseases characterized by inflammation, tissue
remodeling and/or fibrosis including bacterial or fungal infections, lysosomal storage diseases (Gaucher’s),
sarcoidosis, chronic obstructive lung diseases (COPD) and interstitial lung diseases. However, specific role of
Chit1 in the pathogenesis of these diseases have not been elucidated. Recently we reported that Chit1 augments
the effects of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), a critical mediator of tissue fibrosis in health and disease,
contributes to the pathogenesis of interstitial lung disease associated with Scleroderma (SSc-ILD). However, the
mechanisms that Chit1 uses to regulate fibrotic tissue responses and the importance of these mechanisms in
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have not been clearly defined. In preliminary studies, we demonstrate that Chit1
enhances profibrotic macrophage activation, TGF-β1-stimulated fibroblast proliferation, myofibroblast
differentiation, extracellular matrix gene expression and protein accumulation. Importantly, these effects are
mediated by the ability of Chit1 to inhibit TGF-β1 induction of its feedback inhibitor, Smad7. Chit1 interacts with
TGF-β receptor associated protein 1 (Tgfbrap1) and Forkhead Box O3 (FoxO3) with Tgfbrap1 playing a critical
role in Chit1 enhancement of TGF-β1 signaling and effector responses and FoxO3 playing a critical role in TGF-
β1 induction of Samd7. Through extensive drug library screening, we identified Kasugamycin (KSM) as a small
molecule that strongly inhibits Chit1 enzyme activity and tested its therapeutic effect in bleomycin induced
pulmonary fibrosis. In this evaluation, KSM showed an impressive anti-fibrotic effect in both preventive and
therapeutic conditions. These findings led us to a hypothesis that Chit1 and its interacting partners are potential
therapeutic targets for the intervention of pulmonary fibrosis and KSM can be developed as a new class of
therapeutic drug for the patients with pulmonary fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, we will
Aim 1. Define the specific role and mechanism of Tgfbrap1 in Chit1 mediated pulmonary fibrosis.
Aim 2. Characterize Chit1 regulation of FoxO3 and Smad7 in TGF-β stimulated pulmonary fibrosis.
Aim 3. Characterize the therapeutic use of Kasugamycin (KSM) as a Chit1 inhibitor in pulmonary fibrosis."
10847347,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death in
the United States with an overall 5-year survival of 9%. Diagnosis and staging continue to rely
on endoscopic biopsy and imaging, and as such most patients are diagnosed at an advanced
stage. Sufficiently sensitive and specific screening tests for early disease remain elusive.
Moreover, while curative-intent surgery is an option for patients whose disease is confined to
the pancreas, distinguishing patients with metastases who are unlikely to benefit from surgery,
remains challenging due to occult metastases not detectable by imaging. To address these
challenges, several blood-based liquid biopsy biomarkers have been developed but show low
sensitivity for detection of early-stage disease. We have recently shown that circulating tumor
derived extracellular vesicles(EVs) can be isolated from blood and their RNA cargo used to
diagnose early pancreatic cancer and stage disease. These findings suggest an opportunity to
improve patient outcomes through development of a non-invasive diagnostic for pancreatic
cancer. However, as has been well documented, EVs are highly heterogeneous in their
expression of protein surface markers and their nucleic acid and protein cargo, and originate
from multiple cell types in the tumor micro environment (TME) (e.g. tumor cells, tumor
associated macrophages). The ultimate goal of this proposal is to address a fundamental
technological unmet need in EV diagnostics, by further developing our new approach to EV
subpopulation isolation using magnetic nanopores, which combines the benefits of nano-scale
sorting with sufficiently fast flow rates (106x faster than typical nanofluidic approaches) to be
practical for clinical diagnostics. In this R33, we develop this approach into a multiplexed EV
assay that will allow multiple unique EV sub-populations - based on surface marker expression-
to be isolated and their RNA cargo profiled. Building on our prior work that demonstrated the
value of analyzing single EV-subpopulations, and improved sensitivity of a multi-analyte vs
single analyte test, we will develop a multi-analyte EV-based assay that algorithmically
combines tumor associated EV RNA from multiple circulating EV isolates from the TME, as well
as Circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) concentration, circulating tumor DNA-based KRAS
mutation detection, and CA19-9 using machine learning."
10894599,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
There is critical need to develop novel therapies for neuroblastoma (NB). NB is the most common extracranial
pediatric cancer and even after aggressive multimodal treatments, high-risk patients succumb to progressive
disease. One of the reasons underlying failure of these therapies in NB is the highly immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment generated by tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) that inhibit both innate and adaptive
immune responses. The long-term goal is to better understand the signaling mechanisms by which TAMs
mediate tumor immunosuppression and inhibit anti-tumor immune responses in high-risk NB. The overall
objectives in this particular application are 1) to determine the role of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) in
macrophage (MΦ)-mediated immunosuppression in MYCN and non-MYCN amplified (MYCN-NA) NB tumors
and 2) to test whether Syk inhibitors combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors or standard care of therapies
can improve anti-tumor immune responses in NB. The central hypothesis motivating this research is that Syk in
immunosuppressive TAMs inhibits T cell responses and promotes resistance to checkpoint inhibitors in mouse
models of NB. This hypothesis has been formulated on the basis of evidences generated in our laboratory
utilizing Syk inhibitors and Syk-/- murine models for immuno-oncology. The rationale for the proposed research
is that understanding molecular mechanisms by which Syk promote immunosuppression in MYCN and non-
MYCN amplified (MYCN-NA) tumors has the potential to identify an immunological signature which will predict
responsiveness to Syk inhibitors in NB tumors driven by a Syk-MΦ-dependent immunosuppressive TME.
Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: in Aim 1, we
will evaluate the effects of myeloid Syk deficiency on NB tumor microenvironment and infiltrating immune
populations. In Aim 2, we will investigate molecular mechanisms by which Syk regulate immunosuppressive
MΦ polarization in MYCN and MYCN-NA NB tumors. In Aim 3, we will determine whether Syk inhibitors in
combination with checkpoint blockade or current therapies can augment anti-tumor immune responses in NB.
The significance of our proposal lies in our capacity to develop novel combinatorial therapy of Syk inhibitors
with immunotherapy or standard of care therapies that is more effective than current therapies in NB."

 ADPKD (autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease) is the most prevalent inherited progressive
kidney disease affecting 1:1000 live births in USA. Genetic predisposition is necessary for polycystic kidney
disease (PKD) initiation, although other, incompletely identified downstream processes are required for cyst
growth. Their characterization may provide a unique opportunity for clinical interventions. One of the poorly
studied phenomena in PKD is high adenosine-3-phosphate (ATP) content in cysts. As a powerful regulator of
epithelial water-electrolyte transport, ATP can decrease reabsorption in the collecting duct system where ~70%
of ADPKD cysts develop. Particularly, as a paracrine agent, ATP limits activity of the epithelial sodium channel
(ENaC). Reduced ENaC activity is recognized as pivotal factors of cytogenesis. However, the mechanism of the
pathogenic ATP release and its role in Na+ transport during cyst development remains unclear.
 Pannexins are transmembrane proteins which were recently characterized to be capable of ATP release.
Interaction with P2X7 receptors promotes activation of pannexin-1 (PANX1) by forming high-conductive channels
serving as ATP-permeable pores. Our recently published and pilot data indicate that PKD cysts exhibit a unique
pathogenic situation when abnormally high level of both PANX1 and P2X7 express in cyst-lining cells.
 We hypothesize that the P2X7-dependent switching of pannexin-1 to the active form is the central
mechanism of ATP accumulation in the cysts and their growth. Our data suggest that luminal expression of both
PANX1 and P2X7 proteins dramatically increase in the human ADPKD cysts and in rodent models of PKD.
Moreover, pharmacological and genetic targeting of PANX1 channels and P2X7 receptors slows cyst growth.
 In the proposed project we plan to study if PANX1/P2X7 interaction contributes to ATP release in the
hypomorphic Pkd1RC/RC mouse model of ADPKD and how this mechanism reduces reabsorption across the cystic
epithelium. We will investigate Panx1 and P2rx7 expression during development of ADPKD. A set of experiments
involving patch-clamp is designed in cell cultures and native cysts to study regulation of PANX1-mediated ATP
release. As purinergic signaling is important for epithelial transport we will characterize calcium signaling and
ENaC function in freshly isolated cysts and normal collecting ducts. Breeding of Panx1 mutanat mice with
Pkd1RC/RC strain tests if genetic ablation of pannexin-1 inhibits cystogenesis by limiting ATP release and
improving sodium reabsorption. We also plan to study the potential of repurposing probenecid, a known gout
remedy and pannexin-1 blocker, for ADPKD treatment."
10812403,"Project Summary/Abstract
Obesity, caused by the increase in size and the amount of fat cells (adipocytes), is becoming a worldwide
pandemic, producing a huge public health problem due to the associated risk with developing other diseases.
In mammals, the adipose/fat tissue is composed of classic white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue
(BAT), with WAT serving for energy storage and BAT for energy dissipation to produce heat. A third type of
adipocytes exists, known as beige adipocytes that are transiently generated in WA T depots in response to
environmental stimulations. BAT/beige fats are the established thermogenic tissues that play an essential role in
human energy homeostasis and therefore in protection of obesity-related metabolic disorders. While white
adipocytes and brown adipocytes differentiate from precursors with distinct origins, it is the consensus that Wnt/β-
catenin signaling imposes negative effects on adipogenesis by inhibiting adipogenic differentiation. Although
some studies have implicated the requirement of Wnt signaling and its components in adipogenesis and proper
functions of adipose tissues, direct evidence is lacking, leaving a critical knowledge gap as if Wnt signaling plays
a direct and crucial role in adipogenesis. In our preliminary studies, we have surprisingly discovered the existence
of a population of Wnt/β-catenin signaling driven adipocytes, named as Wnt+ adipocytes, in various fat depots
including bone marrow in mice from embryonic stage to adulthood. Using Wnt+ adipocytes induced from SVF
cells in vitro, we further showed the requirement of the ligand- and receptor-independent Wnt/β-catenin signaling,
which appeared to depend on active Akt/mTOR signaling, in adipocyte maturation. Our scRNA-seq and scATAC-
seq analyses have distinguished this novel population of adipocytes from the classic adipocytes at molecular and
genomic levels. We also found that these adipocytes exhibit potentially high metabolic and thermogenic
properties, being able to convert/transdifferentiate into beige adipocytes in response to cold stress, and being
implicated in systemic energy homeostasis. Based on these preliminary results, we hypothesize that a novel
population of Wnt/β-catenin signaling driven adipocytes is widely present in various fat depots and plays crucial
function in regulating whole body metabolic homeostasis. In this proposal, two specific aims are proposed to test
this hypothesis rigorously: 1) to characterize endogenous Wnt+ adipocytes and to investigate the functional
mechanism of the intracellular Wnt/β-catenin signaling in adipogenesis; 2) To determine the in vivo function of
Wnt+ adipocytes in regulating whole-body metabolism in fetal/neonatal and adult stage. Overall, we will define
the identity at cellular, molecular, and genomic levels of a novel population of Wnt/β-catenin driven adipocytes
that exist in various fat depots and exhibit potentially high metabolic and thermogenic properties. We will also
assess overall impacts of this population of adipocytes on adipose tissue function, whole-body metabolic
homeostasis, and protection of obesity. The proposal will also address the functional mechanism and identify
direct targets of the Akt/mTOR signaling dependent intracellular Wnt/β-catenin signaling during adipogenesis in
this population of adipocytes. Results obtained from proposed studies will reveal the origin, recruitment,
activation, molecular regulation, and function of a unique population of thermogenic adipocytes, providing novel
knowledge to the biology of adipocytes as well as solid foundation for future application of this population of
adipocytes in the therapy of obesity."

A wide range of skeletal conditions require assisted bone repair, including trauma, cancer resections, and bone
augmentation for oral implant therapy. Current methods to treat these conditions rely on procedures to harvest
and implant bone autografts, which are costly, invasive and difficult to scale up. The other alternatives are
synthetic bone replacement materials, which show high failure rates and fail to mimic the native bone structure,
composition and osteogenic properties. Stem cell-based tissue engineering has long been proposed as a
promising alternative for the repair of bone defects. However, treating large bony structures remains problematic.
It is generally believed that scaffold materials that closely approximate the characteristics of native bone
represent improved materials for bone regeneration. However, the development of in-vitro scaffolds mimicking
the highly vascularized, innervated, and mineralized cell-rich bone matrix down to the nanoscale has remained
elusive to date. Here, we will develop a new bone scaffold biomanufacturing process where osteoprogenitor cells
are three-dimensionally embedded in controlled nano-mineralized, pre-vascularized and innervated bone-like
injectable microgels, thus mimicking the mineralized nanostructure, cellular and extracellular microenvironment
of native bone. (aim 1) We will determine the mechanistic characteristics enabling the differentiation of hMSCs
into osteogenic phenotypes as influenced by bone-like microenvironments, and engineer cell-laden mineralized
injectable microgels that approximate the regenerative potential of autologous bone grafts. We will then adapt
this strategy to engineer (aim 2) pericyte-supported vascular capillaries and (aim 3) neuronal networks, that are
embedded in nanoscale mineralized hydrogels, to determine the mechanisms that enable vasculature and
innervation enhancement of osteogenesis in-vitro and regeneration in-vivo. We argue that this multi-pronged
strategy will enable the engineering of highly innovative bone scaffold materials and in-vitro bone model systems
that will share great nanostructural and physical similarities to native bone. Ultimately, this will lead to
biomaterials that closely approximate the regenerative potential of autologous bone in the clinic."

ED point prevalence and mean scores on dimensional ED measures across 5 cohorts of college students
randomly sampled from the same university population in 1982, 1992, 2002, 2012, and 2022, 2) examine the
longitudinal course of eating pathology from late adolescence to midlife (18 to 62+ years), and 3) identify
predictors of course focusing on factors unique to adulthood. This project will offer new insights into how
generation impacts gender differences in EDs and how both gender and generation impact longitudinal
trajectory. This project builds on a study initiated in 1982 and replicated with the addition of new cohorts and
extended with follow-up of well-characterized, established cohorts every 10 years since its inception. In the
spring of 2022, 1600 undergraduates (800 women and 800 men) will be randomly sampled to complete
surveys of weight, height, body image disturbance, dieting, disordered eating behaviors, and EDs. In addition,
participants who completed these assessments in college will be sought for 10-, 20-, 30-, and 40-year follow-
up. We project collecting 20-year follow-up data in over 1,700 adults (>70% retention), including nearly 500
men and over 400 participants from ethnic/racial minority groups. These data will allow us to examine
generation X age effects to determine whether course of eating pathology differs across Baby Boomers (1982
cohort), Generation X (1992 cohort), and Millennials (2002 cohort). The investigation will be conducted in two
stages: a survey phase and an interview phase. The survey phase will replicate methods employed for data
collection in all prior waves to ensure comparability of data. Surveys include detailed items about demographic
background; height and weight; dieting, body image, and exercise; 5 scales of the Eating Disorders Inventory
(Bulimia, Drive for Thinness, Maturity Fears, Perfectionism, and Interpersonal Distrust); and symptoms of
anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, and permit DSM-5 ED diagnosis and diagnoses of
their partial and subthreshold variants. In addition, beginning in the 3rd wave, surveys included the Eating
Disorder Diagnostic Scale which is included as a core ED assessment for the NIMH. On the basis of self-report
survey data, all subjects diagnosed with an ED and controls matched to these subjects on age, sex, race, and
ethnicity will be recruited for participation in the interview phase of the study. Interviews will establish the
validity of survey assessments, as well as provide data on psychosocial function, suicidality, comorbidity, and
treatment history for a nonclinical sample, similar to their use in the 3rd wave, 20 years ago. The long-term
objectives of this project are to evaluate whether we are making progress in reducing the public health burden
associated with EDs, determine the adult developmental course of EDs, and identify predictors of ED trajectory
that can be translated into targets for intervention, including what to modify, in whom, and when."

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an extremely aggressive disease with poor overall survival.
Despite the success of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), current forms of immunotherapy benefit less than
15% of HNSCC patients. Therefore, there exists a critical need for new strategies for achieving powerful and
durable immune responses with minimal toxicity. Our objective in this application is to design and develop new
technological tools for inducing and potentiating T-cell responses against HPV+ HNSCC. To this end, we have
engineered a nanoparticle vaccine delivery vehicle that can efficiently deliver antigens and adjuvant molecules
to antigen-presenting cells and achieve strong T-cell responses with robust cytotoxic potential. In addition, we
have identified a novel strategy for harnessing the immune system by altering the gut microbiome to further
amplify nanovaccine-primed T-cell responses. Here, we seek to conduct structure-function studies to understand
how these biomaterials interface with our immune system and apply the knowledge gained from these basic
studies to potentiate T-cell responses against HPV+ HNSCC. In particular, we will address the following
questions by applying the principles of drug delivery, bioengineering, and vaccinology. Can we utilize our strategy
to promote antigen and adjuvant delivery to antigen-presenting cells, and improve systemic and local T-cell
responses in vivo? Can we employ our vaccine delivery technology to unleash the full cytotoxic potential of T-
cells and reverse immunosuppression within HNSCC? Can we alter the gut microbiome to boost efficacy of
combination immunotherapy? Can we demonstrate their efficacy in orthotopic models of HPV+ HNSCC,
including genetically engineered mouse model of HNSCC? These studies may lead to a novel strategy for
harnessing our immune system as the potential treatment of HPV+ HNSCC. The proposal is fully responsive to
PAR-19-172 as it will: (1) drive the maturation of an innovative technology for precise immune modulation, (2)
create technologies for versatile adjuvant delivery, and (3) enhance the immunotherapeutics for an NIDCR
priority disease."

There exists a fundamental gap at the molecular level in understanding how intermediate filament proteins as-
semble into mature filaments. Continued existence of this gap is an important problem because, until this need
is met, understanding of how intermediate filaments function in large macromolecular complexes and how path-
ologic mutations alter filament assembly will remain elusive. The long-term goal is to intelligently manipulate and
target intermediate filament systems for the prevention and treatment of human diseases. The objective in this
application is to define the molecular mechanisms that enable intermediate filament proteins to assemble into
mature filaments and to interact with epidermal proteins in large macromolecular complexes. The central hy-
pothesis is that the knob-pocket tetramerization mechanism in intermediate filaments drives mature filament
formation and facilitates the assembly of cutaneous protein complexes critical for establishing skin barrier integ-
rity. This hypothesis is generated from preliminary data produced in the applicant’s lab. The rationale for the
proposed research is that, once intermediate filament assembly and protein interaction mechanisms are molec-
ularly characterized, intermediate filament networks can be specifically targeted and pharmacologically regu-
lated for the clinical benefit of patients currently without adequate therapies. Supported by robust preliminary
data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Determine how 1B knob-pocket interactions
regulate assembly of mature intermediate filaments; and 2) Elucidate the molecular basis of keratin interactions
with desmoplakin and filaggrin. Under the first aim, a combination of mutagenesis, light scattering, filament as-
sembly assays coupled with negative stain electron microscopy, x-ray crystallography, and transient transfection
cell biology will be used to establish the molecular functions of the “knob-pocket” tetramerization mechanism
located in the 1B domain of intermediate filaments. Under the second aim, binding assays, mutagenesis, iso-
thermal titration calorimetry, x-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, and cellular adhesion and migration
assays will be used to characterize the molecular interfaces driving keratin intermediate filaments to form com-
plexes with desmoplakin and filaggrin in human epidermis. The approach is innovative because it takes a new
intermediate filament assembly mechanism discovered in the applicant’s lab and examines previously unex-
plored questions about how this mechanism contributes to human skin barrier integrity through protein complex
formation in the epidermis and through regulation of cell migration. It is also innovative because it utilizes novel
peptides developed in the applicant’s lab to probe intermediate filament functions in cells. The proposed re-
search is significant because it will advance the knob-pocket tetramerization mechanism as a novel molecular
target for developing intermediate filament-specific therapies that prevent or treat human diseases."

 White and brown adipose tissues are highly vascularized organs, capable of plasticity based on
metabolic demands and energy expenditure. However maladaptive regulation of these tissues can lead to
insulin resistance. Critical gaps remain in our understanding of how angiogenesis impacts adipose tissue
dysfunction and overall metabolism. MicroRNAs (miRs) are implicated in the regulation of the angiogenic
response to pathophysiological stimuli. The role of miRs in regulating the angiogenic response in diet-induced
insulin resistance is poorly understood.
 Using a miRNA-Seq approach, we identified that miR-409-3p expression was significantly increased in
endothelial cells (ECs) of brown adipose tissue (BAT) of diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and in human diabetic
plasma samples compared to non-diabetic patients. Overexpression of miR-409-3p markedly inhibited EC
growth and migration, whereas miR-409-3p inhibition had the opposite effects. Preliminary studies indicate that
miR-409-3p targets the 3’UTRs of Zinc Finger E-box binding Homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and Mitogen-activated
protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 3 (MAP4K3). Overexpression of miR-409-3p decreased ZEB1 and
MAP4K3 expression in ECs, whereas inhibition had the opposite effect. SiRNA knockdown of ZEB1 or
MAP4K3 expression in ECs phenocopied the effects of miR-409-3p overexpression and significantly
decreased EC proliferation and migration. 3T3-L1 cells or human skin fat organoids co-cultured with
supernatant harvested from ECs overexpressing miR-409-3p had decreased expression of brown adipocyte
markers (UCP1, Cidea) by RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses, whereas supernatant harvested from ECs
deficient in miR-409-3p increased expression of brown adipocyte markers. Systemic intravenous delivery of
LNA-anti-miR-409-3p inhibitor to DIO mice significantly increased angiogenesis by CD31 staining,
accompanied by higher UCP-1 in BAT and sWAT by RT-qPCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry
analyses, while improving glucose and insulin tolerance and overall metabolism. Therefore, we hypothesize
that miR-409-3p serves as a critical regulator of EC growth and angiogenesis in adipose tissue and may
improve metabolic dysfunction in DIO. To explore this, we first propose in Aim1 to investigate the molecular
mechanisms by which miR-409-3p regulates EC growth and angiogenesis. In Aim2, we will delineate the
mechanisms by which miR-409-3p in ECs regulates browning in adipose tissues. Finally, in Aim3, we will
explore the effect of miR-409-3p neutralization in the vasculature of adipose tissues and development of DIO
and insulin resistance in mice. Successful completion of these studies will shed insights on the regulatory role
of miR-409-3p between impaired angiogenesis in diet-induced obesity and adipose tissue dysfunction, an
effect that could be exploited for therapeutic intervention in obesity-induced insulin resistance."
10831980,"Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-Associated Degradation (ERAD) is a major ER quality-control program that
monitors and translocates unfolded or misfolded protein substrates from the ER to cytosol for polyubiquitination
and proteasomal degradation. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation, the most prevalent internal modification
of mammalian mRNAs, is known to regulate the stability, translation, and function of almost every major class of
human RNAs. Three major families of proteins, including writers, readers, and erasers, are known to be
responsible for the reversible RNA m6A methylation process. However, the signal transduction pathway
underlying the regulation of RNA m6A modification remain elusive. Herein, we accumulated strong preliminary
evidence for an unprecedented circadian-regulated ERAD pathway that controls mRNA m6A modification and
subsequent lipid homeostasis, which we called “circadian ERAD-m6A”. Our major preliminary findings include:
(i) the ER-resident E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1 and its co-factor SEL1L, the major components of ERAD machinery,
are regulated by the circadian clock in the liver; (ii) HRD1 interacts with and mediates polyubiquitination and
degradation of the specific m6A writer METTL14 and the reader YTHDF3; (iii) HRD1 liver-specific KO (LKO)
mice display reversed fashions with METTL14-LKO or YTHDF3-knockdown mice in hepatic m6A mRNA
methylation levels, expression of lipid metabolic regulators, and metabolic phenotypes associated with hepatic
steatosis and hyperlipidemia; and (iv) unlike the classic ERAD, the newly-identified ERAD-m6A regulatory axis
and its function in hepatic lipid metabolism are under the control of circadian rhythm. These observations led to
our central hypothesis that the liver HRD1-ERAD program, which is oscillated under the circadian clock,
regulates hepatic m6A RNA modification by controlling rhythmic degradation of the specific m6A writer METTL14
and the reader YTHDF3. This unprecedented circadian ERAD-m6A RNA modification regulatory network, which
may be dysregulated by circadian-disrupting cues, represents a major pathway that controls metabolic
homeostasis associated with hepatic steatosis and hyperlipidemia.
 In this application, we will utilize molecular and cellular approaches, genetically engineered animal models,
and high-throughput profiling of m6A RNA modification to critically address the function and mechanism by which
circadian ERAD regulates hepatic m6A RNA modification and lipid metabolism. In two aims, we will: 1) define a
novel circadian ERAD pathway that modulates rhythmic m6A RNA modification through degrading the specific
m6A writer and reader; and 2) determine the functional significance of circadian ERAD-m6A RNA modification
pathway in maintaining lipid homeostasis. Upon completion of this project, we will reveal the function and
mechanism by which a novel circadian ERAD-m6A RNA modification pathway regulates lipid homeostasis
associated with metabolic disorders. The findings will open up new paradigms for the studies on the physiological
ERAD and m6A RNA modification and shed new light on developing therapeutics for metabolic disease."

Endocytosis is the process of uptake of cargo and ﬂuid from the extracellular space to inside the cell; defects in endo-
cytosis contribute to a wide spectrum of diseases including cancer, neurodegeneration, and heart disease. Clathrin-
mediated endocytosis (CME) is an archetypal example of a membrane deformation process where multiple variables
such as pre-existing membrane curvature, membrane bending due to the protein machinery, membrane tension regula-
tion, and actin-mediated forces govern the progression of vesiculation. Advances in imaging technology have recently
led to an explosion in morphological and biochemical data sets that track the progression of CME. While computa-
tional modeling of lipid bilayers has provided insight into the mechanics of membranes in general, a mechanistic and
predictive framework that can relate the plasma membrane composition and plasma membrane-cytoskeleton interac-
tions to the progression and robustness of CME is missing, resulting in a gap between the experimental advances
in the study of CME and a predictive, mechanistic framework for harnessing CME for nanomedicines. Preliminary
data from our group has shown that membrane tension plays an important role in governing the progression of CME.
How does membrane tension govern the progression of CME in the presence of membrane-protein interactions and
membrane-cytoskeleton interactions? Substantial preliminary data in this application supports the working hypothesis
that membrane tension is a dynamic quantity that evolves over the progression of CME to modulate the energy bar-
rier associated with vesiculation. Speciﬁcally, the work of the principal investigator, supported by ﬁndings from others
has identiﬁed that membrane tension governs CME through a snapthrough instability. Building on these preliminary
ﬁndings, the goal of the proposed work is to elucidate the fundamental biophysical principles of CME. In the proposed
work, we have outlined three hypotheses and aims aims that will enable us to close this knowledge gap. Aim 1 will test
the hypothesis that membrane-protein interactions during CME are regulated by membrane tension dynamically; this
hypothesis will be tested using new theoretical and computational models that will incorporate the energetics of mem-
brane-protein interactions and in-plane diffusion of proteins along the membrane. It is expected that membrane tension
will emerge as a dynamic modulator of local membrane deformations due to protein interactions. Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that force generation during CME depends on the actin organization around an endocytic pit; this hypoth-
esis will focus on the development of theoretical models that incorporate the dynamic and stochastic actin-membrane
interactions and predict the spatio-temporal organization of actin ﬁlaments around an endocytic pit. Aim 3 will test
the hypothesis that pre-existing curvature of the membrane can modify the energy landscape of the progression of
CME; models will be developed to test this hypothesis using different initial curvatures of the substrate. Collectively, the
insights provided by the modeling effort conducted in these three aims will provide insight into how membrane-protein
and membrane-cytoskeleton interactions affect the progression of CME."
10746803,"Pneumocystis pneumonia (PcP) remains a serious life-threatening respiratory fungal infection of
immunocompromised patients, and one of the most common AIDS-defining illnesses in the US and the
world. PcP-related mortality rates have changed little over the past two decades, likely due to our inability to
adequately treat the infection without exacerbating immunopathogenesis. Adjunctive corticosteroids are used to
suppress inflammatory injury during antibiotic treatment, but the benefit of these broadly acting agents is
uncertain. The mechanisms by which Pc is recognized and cleared from the lung remain incompletely
understood. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are at the frontline of the host-pathogen interaction, and serve as
important effectors of pulmonary host defense against Pneumocystis. Macrophages possess an array of PRR
that have the potential to recognize Pc, but they are typically ineffective for host defense when CD4+ T cell help
is not available. The reason for this is unknown, but it has been suggested that Pc may actively avoid or suppress
macrophage mediated host defense to insure survival and transmission. Our laboratory has identified an inbred
mouse strain which is unique in its ability to resist Pc infection in the absence of T cells. The resistance phenotype
requires the presence of AMs, and can be overridden by reprogramming the resistant AMs to a susceptible M1
biased phenotype. The identification of resistant and susceptible macrophage phenotypes will provide an
opportunity to explore the divergent host-pathogen interactions associated with either protection or infection. The
overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that differential macrophage polarization, phagocytic processing of Pc,
and antifungal effector production dictates the outcome of the Pc-AM interaction. To test this hypothesis we will
utilize the resistant and susceptible mouse models described in our Preliminary Studies. The identification of
new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of fungal diseases is an active area of drug-discovery research. Our
long-term goal is to understand the mechanisms regulating macrophage mediated innate immunity in the lung
to facilitate the rational design of therapeutic strategies to enhance host defense while limiting
immunopathogenesis. To accomplish this goal we propose Specific Aims that will: 1) define functional differences
in the phagocytic machinery of resistant and susceptible AMs that dictate the outcome of infection; 2) explore
novel antifungal functions for chitinase-like proteins (Chi3l3) and TAM receptors (MerTK); and 3) map the Pc
resistance locus and identify resistance-associated effector molecules that contribute to protective antifungal
innate immunity. Our Preliminary Studies demonstrate that AMs can be programmed for innate protection against
this opportunistic fungal pathogen, and suggest that modifying macrophage function may represent a viable
strategy to enhance antifungal host defense."

At present, how scratching information is sensed in the skin and processed in the brain to suppress

(
We find that lateral habenula (LHb) neurons are bilaterally activated after
acute pruritogen administration to one side of the mouse cheek, indicating that LHb neurons may respond to
chemical itch sensation and/or scratching-induced mechanosensation. Interestingly, LHb neuronal activation is
significantly reduced in the contralateral side when mice wear collars to prevent scratching, which suggests that
some scratching information is preferentially transmitted to the contralateral LHb. Moreover, re-activation of
either bilateral or contralateral itch/scratching-evoked LHb neurons suppresses scratching. Thus, we raise a
novel hypothesis that the LHb integrates both scratching-induced mechanosensory and chemical itch sensory
inputs and suppress scratching in a lateralized manner and that cutaneous high-threshold mechanoreceptors
are required to transmit scratching information to the LHb. We will use a combination of cutting-edge techniques
to test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will thoroughly examine molecular, circuit, and physiological properties of
itch/scratching-activated LHb neurons on the contralateral vs ipsilateral side, with or without collar. We will also
record population calcium signal changes of LHb neurons in vivo in response to scratching. In Aim 2, we will test
the functional sufficiency and requirement of LHb neurons in suppressing scratching evoked by acute and
chronic itch using chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations as well as LHb neuronal ablation. Finally, in
Aim 3, we will ablate C and/or Aδ high threshold mechanoreceptors (HTMRs), which mediate strong mechanical
or mechanical pain sensation, to test their functional requirements in transmitting scratching information to the
LHb and suppressing scratching. Taken together, our anticipated results will reveal novel neural circuits in
mediating the sensation of scratching and controlling scratch, an exciting area that is largely unexplored but
highly relevant for alleviating chronic itch."

 In the past decade, the field of myelination has undergone a conceptual revolution. Long considered a
static structure, recent studies have revealed that myelination is continuously shaped by external experiences
and plays essential roles in supporting learning and memory. A key question that emerges from these studies is
how oligodendrocytes, and the myelin sheaths they produce, influence neuronal circuits to impact behavior. My
long-term research goal is to determine how oligodendrocytes and myelin shape neuronal circuit function and
plasticity during development, learning, and memory. This work will crucially advance our knowledge of the
cellular processes underlying neural circuit maturation and lifelong plasticity, particularly considering the
numerous recent studies identifying myelination deficits as a common pathological hallmark of
neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders with cognitive symptoms, including autism spectrum
disorders, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease. Given its well-characterized developmental windows for
experience-induced neuronal plasticity and accessibility for in vivo readouts of neuronal activity, the mouse visual
cortex presents an ideal model for studying the interaction between external experience, myelination, and
neuronal plasticity. I will use novel genetic tools in combination with in vivo longitudinal two-photon imaging and
in vivo/slice electrophysiology to 1) test the effects of disrupting developmental myelination on the maturation of
functional neuronal properties and experience-induced plasticity, 2) determine the synaptic basis for circuit
modulation by myelination, and 3) investigate the cell type-specific roles of myelination in circuit function by
inhibiting myelination in specific populations of neurons. Results from these experiments will define the specific
neuron-myelin interactions underlying neuronal circuit maturation and plasticity with unprecedented rigor and
cell specificity, and provide a foundation for studying how these processes are perturbed in pathological contexts.
Furthermore, completion of these aims will provide me with rigorous training in in vivo electrophysiology and
analysis of large-scale electrophysiology data, which will be critical in the establishment of my independent
research program focused on the role of myelination in neuronal circuit maturation and function, as well as how
disruptions in myelination can lead to circuit dysfunction in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders."
10824377,"Abstract

At least one-third of patients who receive treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) do not attain remission and meet criteria for treatment resistant depression (TRD). TRD carries an increased risk of suicide, medical comorbidity, and increased morbidity. There is a growing consensus that increased inflammatory activity contributes to the persistence of depressive symptoms in many of these patients, presenting the opportunity for a novel treatment approach to TRD. Studies suggest that a subset of patients with MDD may benefit from omega-3 fatty acids (n-3s), specifically individuals who manifest chronic inflammation as a component of their illness. One of the n-3s, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is the precursor of a variety of bioactive lipid molecules, many with anti-inflammatory effects at concentrations 100 to 1000 times lower than EPA. A dosage of 4 g/day of EPA-enriched n-3, given over 12 weeks demonstrated a significantly greater antidepressant response than either 1 or 2 g/day. Furthermore, our work suggests that overweight/obese individuals with MDD and inflammation (hs-CRP levels ≥3 mg/L) may be highly responsive to this treatment. Preliminary data support involvement of resolution of inflammation, mediated by lipid molecules called specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs). In keeping with the hypothesized inflammation-resolving mechanism of action of n-3s in MDD, our data demonstrated that a sustained response on the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, Clinician-Rated version (IDS-C30) scale was correlated with increased levels of the EPA-derived SPM precursor 18-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (18-HEPE). We propose a 12-week, randomized placebo-controlled, double-masked, augmentation trial of 4 g/day EPA-enriched n-3 treatment in adults with MDD, inadequate response to antidepressants (TRD), BMI >25 and ≤ 40 kg/m2 and inflammation (hs-CRP ≥ 3 and ≤ 10 mg/L). We hypothesize that adding 4 g/day of EPA-enriched n-3 to overweight/obese MDD patients with inadequate response to ongoing antidepressant treatment and hs-CRP ≥ 3 and ≤ 10 mg/L will 1) significantly increase plasma 18-HEPE concentration since baseline, compared to treatment with placebo, and 2) result in significantly greater increases in plasma 18-HEPE concentration since baseline for sustained MADRS responders (those with at least 50% reduction since baseline in MADRS scores at both treatment week 8 and week 12) than for (a) unsustained/non-responders to EPA-enriched n-3 as well as (b) placebo-supplemented sustained responders. Exploratory Aims will evaluate whether EPA-enriched n-3 augmentation results in a significantly greater decrease in peripheral markers of inflammation than placebo and whether gene mediated variation is responsible for differences in n-3 and SPM levels and thus treatment response. This study will determine if plasma 18-HEPE is a mediator of treatment response. Further, this study will include additional evidence of safety and tolerability, and evaluate the strength of the association between target engagement and change in symptoms/function."
10876904,"Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the causal agent of Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS) and several other malignancies. We have discovered that, unlike most other types of cancer cells that are addicted to glucose and aerobic glycolysis, KSHV-transformed cells do not depend on glucose and have a reduced level of aerobic glycolysis. Instead, KSHV-transformed cells are addicted to glutamine. More surprisingly, glutamine is primarily shunted to the syntheses of nucleotides and amino acids. To maintain the metabolic flow and clear the toxic products, KSHV hijacks the citrulline-urea cycle by upregulating the key rate-limiting metabolic enzyme argininosuccinate synthase 1 (ASS1). Significantly, ASS1 is essential for the proliferation and survival of KSHV- transformed cells and upregulation of the citrulline-urea cycle further provides an essential STAT3 oncogenic signal by inducing nitric oxide. Our hypothesis is that KSHV encodes specific gene(s) to hijack the citrulline-urea cycle to support the proliferation and survival of KSHV-transformed cells, and hence targeting this pathway is effective for treating KSHV-induced tumors. We have developed an efficient model of KSHV-induced cellular transformation and tumorigenesis, three-dimensional (3D) culture models KSHV- transformed cells, and advanced metabolic profiling and tracing technologies, all of which are particularly useful for testing this novel hypothesis. We will examine the essential roles of ASS1 and citrulline-urea cycle for maintaining metabolic flow, clearing toxic products and activating STAT3 pathway to support KSHV-induced cellular transformation (Aim 1); determine the mechanism by which ASS1 and active citrulline-urea cycle activate the STAT3 pathway to support KSHV-induced cellular transformation (Aim 2); determine the mechanism by which KSHV upregulates ASS1 and hijacks the citrulline-urea cycle (Aim 3); and determine the therapeutic potential of targeting key enzymes in the citrulline-urea cycle for treating KSHV-induced tumorigenesis (Aim 4). The proposed project is highly significant as it will test a novel hypothesis of KSHV manipulation of a key cellular metabolic pathway using multidisciplinary innovative approaches and model systems. It is our expectations that accomplishment of this project will lead to the identification of novel cancer drivers and vulnerabilities of KSHV-induced cancers, which could provide a scientific basis for developing novel therapies."
10878704,"Nigeria has the highest prevalence of sickle cell disease (SCD) in the world with an estimated 150,000 babies
born annually. Children with SCD in Africa are particularly susceptible to infections, with about 50%-90% dying
before five years of age. This burden can be substantially reduced by early diagnosis and supportive care with
penicillin prophylaxis, and hydroxyurea (HU) treatment, especially for those at risk of stroke. However, these
interventions are yet to be widely implemented in patients with SCD in Nigeria. The Sickle Pan African Research
Consortium (SPARCO), with collaborative sites in Ghana, Nigeria and Tanzania was funded by the NIH/ NHLBI
in 2017 to establish the infrastructure for future research in SCD. The SPARCO Site in Nigeria is set up at the
Centre of Excellence for Sickle Cell Disease Research &Training, University of Abuja (CESRTA). In the first
phase of the award, we established the management structure in relation to the Clinical and Data Coordinating
Centres and participated actively in consortium working groups’ activities. We obtained and maintained ethical
approvals; established a REDCap database under the guidance of the Sickle Africa Data Coordinating Centre
(SADaCC); and successfully recruited 4,687 patients across 19 sites using uniform case report forms in
collaboration with the Sickle Cell Support Society of Nigeria. (Figure) We delivered specialized training in
research and health care management of SCD to 915 health care workers including those in primary health care
centres (PHCs). We developed a curriculum for a Master’s degree in Clinical Research and a Postgraduate
Diploma in Bioinformatics to address identified gaps. We analyzed preliminary data from the registry and
described the clinical phenotypes of SCD in SPARCO Nigeria cohort and conducted an implementation study
on newborn. Building on these successes, we are now aiming to sustain, enhance and grow the SCD Network
in Africa in order to advance SCD-related epidemiological, translational and clinical research and policy through
the Sickle Pan African Research Consortium NigEria (SPARC-NEt) Cohort Study. Our strategy is to increase
the SPARC-Net SCD Cohort to 9,000 by: a) recruiting additional 2,000 individuals and bringing in six additional
recruitment sites and b) expanding newborn screening to establish a birth cohort of 1000 SCD patients. We will
expand, implement, and evaluate the use of the SPARCO Standards of Care (SoC) guidelines for the follow up
and management of patients with SCD in the SPARC-NEt Sites and determine the impact of training of, and
engagement with, health workers, parents and support groups on the overall health outcomes for individuals with
SCD in Nigeria. Additionally, we described three potential implementation and cohort studies that could be
adopted by the consortium including a) assess patient characteristics and incidence of clinical events using
SPARCO SoC, b) evaluate the impact of HU utilization on clinical and haematological outcomes in patients within
the SPARC-Net cohort, and c) using genomic approaches to investigate the association between changes in
gut microbiome, HbF levels and frequency of vaso-occlusive crisis in SPARC-Net SCD birth cohort."

 Chronic lung disease and heart failure (HF) are highly prevalent, commonly co-occur, and are associated with
significant morbidity and mortality. Work from our group and others has demonstrated an independent
relationship between chronic lung disease and incident HF that may be driven in part by inflammation. We have
also documented that even in the absence of symptomatic lung disease, impaired lung function defined by
spirometry is associated with adverse cardiac remodeling on echocardiography and incident HF events. While
symptomatic lung disease and HF often occur in the elderly, many younger adults have relatively asymptomatic
impairment in lung health and cardiac structure and function. These subclinical cardiopulmonary abnormalities
develop during the key modifiable period from young adulthood to midlife. However, data are sparse on the
timing and associated mechanisms of the transition from health to disease spanning young adulthood to midlife,
and related race-sex differences. Without identifying these unique patterns of change, it will not be possible to
screen for subclinical changes and employ prevention strategies prior to irreversible damage in the lung and
heart. This requires upstream identification at the earliest detectable change. While spirometry is the gold
standard for lung disease detection, it is a relatively crude and insensitive measure of impaired lung health. In
contrast, lung injury (quantified using a novel local histogram analysis developed and validated by our group)
from computed tomography (CT) scans is a more sensitive and earlier indicator of impaired lung health (e.g. due
to tobacco, air pollution, and respiratory viral infection). Therefore, we now propose to take advantage of the
Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study’s unique platform to study the temporal
relationship of and mechanisms underlying the transition from lung and heart health to disease. To-date, our
group has investigated the predictors and consequences of impaired lung health and HF, separately, in CARDIA.
In this project, we will build upon our prior work by analyzing CT scans to determine the concurrent evolution of
lung injury and adverse cardiac remodeling and identify mechanisms by assaying a multitude of blood-based
biomarkers (using a multiplexed array) and performing 4-dimensional flow cardiovascular magnetic resonance
imaging (cMRI). We will test the hypothesis that detailed imaging and blood-based markers can inform clinically
relevant endotypes reflecting dynamic changes in lung injury and adverse cardiac remodeling during a key
vulnerable period of life through the following specific aims: (1) Determine the longitudinal association between
lung injury and left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV); (2) Determine the risk of subclinical and clinical HF
among joint lung injury and LVEDV trajectory groups; and (3) Determine the hemodynamic mediators of the
association between lung injury and adverse cardiac remodeling. This study will investigate factors associated
with transitions from cardiopulmonary health to disease and associated mechanisms, and in doing so, will identify
screening strategies and contribute novel pathways for targeted disease interception of lung and heart disease."
10868441,"This proposal for a cohort-based early stage graduate training at Boston University (BU) describes the successful
development of a university wide effort called ""The Graduate Program for Neuroscience"" (GPN) that celebrates
diversity in membership and scientific perspective. Since the time of its first official class, recruited in 2010, the
program has emphasized the importance of combining a shared training experience for an educationally diverse
group of students that integrates a comprehensive foundation in neuroscience with principles of experimental
design, computer programming, computational modeling, and advanced quantitative thinking as an essential
part of doing basic research on the nervous system and its brain disorders. The program also fosters an
appreciation for translational research efforts by integrating physician-led patient interactions for its students in
a unique clinical rounds experience. GPN is an independent degree granting program which administers two
PhD degrees, one in Neuroscience and the other in Computational Neuroscience. All students during their first
two years take shared curriculum to develop a “core knowledge base” in neuroscience which is expanded upon
by training in specialized areas of thesis research through organized electives. This didactic training in the first
two years is complemented by peer-based learning experiences where GPN students with undergraduate majors
in computer science, math, or engineering help others in the cohort to develop a better framework to master
these topics in our “core” quantitative courses. Likewise, those students with undergraduate training in
biochemistry, biology, psychology, and neuroscience bring computer scientists, engineers, and mathematicians
in the cohort closer to an understanding of how cells function as units, within cellular networks, and the complexity
of behaviors that rely on them. This peer-based perspective during the first two years in training will help inform
the computational models these students build with their faculty mentors in the later years of their training. A
vibrant cohort experience is facilitated by the modern student desk spaces, conference room, and student lounge
that was built specifically for GPN students in a building which houses the GPN Administrative Offices. As a
single cohort, neuroscience PhDs and computational neuroscience PhDs participate in professional
development workshops, rotate through the laboratories of our many distinguished and junior faculty, take
leadership of committees, and are dedicated practitioners of the values GPN places on diversity, equity,
inclusion, and accessibility for all. The planned duration of appointments to the proposed T32 will be two years
for three students in an average class size of 10. We are fully committed to helping students reach their highest
potential by uniting them through their common interest in understanding how the brain works; and, through a
direct exposure to human patients building their commitment towards improving the human condition."

The objective of the University of Chicago Institutional T32 Training program is to provide a scientifically
rigorous and intellectually stimulating interdisciplinary research training environment for physicians who have
completed ACGME accredited residency training to prepare for research-intensive careers in academia,
government and industry. Candidates for T32 training are nationally recruited through Residency Matching
program to the Section of Hematology/Oncology within our Department of Medicine with the expectation that
candidates for T32 training will complete one clinical year funded by the hospital and then have a minimum
of two or three years of research training under the proposed training grant depending on whether they
perform patient-oriented research or fundamental basic/translational/population research. The direction of
the program – provision of multidisciplinary, structured, career development, mentoring and leadership
opportunities in cancer research – has not changed since the program’s inception, but we have continued to
evolve the program in response to a national need to develop and/or enhance research training
opportunities for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds interested in team science and translational
research. There are several unique structural elements in the research training proposed: 1) access to a
diverse population of cancer patients; 2) training under the guidance of multidisciplinary research
preceptor(s) within a robust scientific environment that provides innovative scientific approaches, tools and
technologies; 3) specific educational pathways in the form of course work and special seminars leading to
advanced degree or certificate from any relevant unit in the University; and 4) community engagement and
service learning opportunities to accelerate progress in cancer research and promote health equity. The

Senior and
22
Clinical/Junior research training faculty preceptors have NIH or equivalent peer- reviewed
funding, interact on a number of collaborative research and training efforts and are well qualified to serve as
potential mentors for the six trainees per year participating in this T32 program. Our extensive inpatient and
outpatient facilities promote a comprehensive clinical training experience, while our research laboratories
allow for the acquisition of basic research skills. With significant investments in new cancer programs and
enhanced facilities, we have revamped our curriculum to offer coursework in emerging areas of cancer
research including chemical biology, proteo-genomics, metabolomics, data science, implementation science
and global oncology. In addition to leadership experience and entrepreneurship, our diverse populations in
Chicago and our global partners will provide opportunities in community engaged research to advance novel
interventions to reduce disparities in cancer outcomes. With the rapid pace of scientific advancement, a well-
trained work force as proposed remains a wise investment for the nation."

an unprecedented experience for predoctoral trainees and is predicted to strengthen their commitment to
research careers that drive real change in clinical practice. Eligible candidates will be recruited through the Irell
& Manella Graduate School of Biological Sciences (IMGS) at COH. After 2 years of IMGS core curriculum,
PROMT students will commit to engage in PhD dissertation research and T32 program activities for 2 years. A
3rd year of PROMT training is available by competitive renewal. Trainees will select from among 16 Mentors and
17 Co-Mentors/Clinical Partners that comprise a collaborative group of faculties with a diverse array of interests
from basic, translational to clinical science. Research interests of the mentors include islet biology, epigenetics,
genomics and metabolomics, adipose and muscle metabolic dysregulation, and human islet transplantation,
among others. Program highlights include robust institutional support (Years 1 and 2) and unique research
resources on campus, including 3 GMP-compliant manufacturing facilities, and the Helford Clinical Research

Island. Today, the Flow Cytometry Core continues to fulfill this critical role and supports a multitude of research
programs, projects and diverse research areas at Rhode Island Hospital and different institutions in the state of
Rhode Island. It remains heavily utilized, partially due to the strong support and success of the COBRE’s here
in Rhode Island but also the strategic importance and basic relevance that flow cytometry brings to the research
community at large. This is the only research flow cytometry core facility at Rhode Island Hospital and the only
research flow cytometry core facility that offers access to a 5-laser sorter, 4-laser analyzer and a mass cytometer
in the state. Flow cytometry remains an extremely useful tool for researchers over many different research
disciplines. The institution has been generous with its administrative and fiscal support of the Flow Cytometry
Core. Notably, this year Rhode Island Hospital has purchased and installed, a Fluidigm Helios CyTOF system,
that is now available through the COBRE Flow Cytometry Core. This CyTOF platform will be utilized by clinical
and basic researchers in the State of Rhode Island and shows a high level of support and dedication to the
success of the proposed COBRE Flow Cytometry Core. With the new state-of-the-art instrumentation and Core
expansion plan directed towards expanding inclusion of clinical research projects, our Core is well positioned to
continue its growth and achieve long-term financial sustainability."

 This project aims to elucidate the mechanism for allosteric regulation of SIRT1 activity via the N-terminal
domain of SIRT1, a conformationally dynamic region distal to the catalytic core. SIRT1 is an NAD+-dependent
protein deacetylase which has been shown to play a significant role in many biological pathways, such as insulin
secretion, tumor formation, lipid metabolism and neurodegeneration. For this reason, SIRT1 has been identified
as a potential therapeutic target. This progress has been hampered by insufficient understanding of the
molecular mechanism of the regulation of SIRT1 activity, as the C-terminal and N-terminal domains within SIRT1
play complicated roles in allosterically affecting SIRT1 activity. The N-terminal domain has been shown to
potentiate SIRT1’s enzyme activity; this region also contains the STAC binding domain (SBD), a binding site for
sirtuin activating compounds (STACs). However, there is limited in vitro biochemistry study regarding the role of
the N-terminal domain in SIRT1 regulation. Our project is focused on understanding the allosteric interactions
between the N-terminal domain and SIRT1’s catalytic core using three independent aims as detailed below that
focus on the substrate-dependent regulation of SIRT1 by resveratrol, the regulation of SIRT1 by other STACs,
and the intramolecular regulation of SIRT1 by motif A, a domain within its N-terminal region.
 Aim 1: Examine the role of complex stability and conformational dynamics in the substrate-sequence
dependent regulation of SIRT1 by resveratrol, a well-studied STAC. We will compare the binding affinity of
resveratrol to SIRT1 in the presence of different substrates, compare the stability of different
SIRT1•substrate•resveratrol complexes, and compare the conformations of different
SIRT1•substrate•resveratrol complexes.
 Aim 2: Explore if other STACs with similar or different structures as resveratrol can also regulate SIRT1 in a
substrate-sequence dependent manner. We will characterize the substrate-sequence dependent effect of other
STACs, namely piceatannol and SRT2104 on SIRT1 activity using enzyme activity assays and binding assays.
 Aim 3: Elucidate the mechanism of intramolecular SIRT1 regulation via motif A, an intrinsically disordered
region in the N-terminus of SIRT1 and the role of phosphorylation in this regulation. We will use enzyme activity
assays and binding assays, complemented by molecular dynamics simulations, to determine the effects of
phosphorylation on motif A’s ability to regulate SIRT1 activity.
 Our studies will afford a more detailed understanding of the allosteric regulation of SIRT1 elicited by the N-
terminal domain. This would clarify how the activity of SIRT1 is altered in various biological pathways and disease
states, guiding a more targeted approach in modulating SIRT1 activity as a therapeutic method."

Tendons serve multiple critical roles in locomotion, and functionality can be compromised by the effects of
aging, disuse, and tendinopathy. For the aging population, the combination of these factors greatly reduces
mobility and contributes to the likelihood of falling. Many structural changes that occur with age and/or training
in tendon have been shown to impact tendon mechanics, including changes in cross-sectional area (CSA),
straightening of collagen fibrils, and increase in advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). Exercise can
mitigate some of these age-related declines, but previous studies have demonstrated that the ‘core’ of tendons
is fully formed by skeletal maturity and thus the capacity of tendon to respond to load is limited post-maturation
[16,17]. Despite this documented phenomenon, the response of tendon to loading in early life tendon is largely
unknown, nor its consequences for later life tendon performance. This proposed research aims to address two
key and related gaps in the understanding of ontogenetic interactions with tendon loading—how tendon
loading in early life impacts later life tendon mechanics, and how early life tendon adaptation to load differs (if
at all) from mature tendon. We will test the potential for early life exercise to protect against late-life
tendinopathy and identify structural mechanisms contributing to differing tendon functional morphology
between juvenile-loaded tendons and adult-loaded tendons using a 10-week exercise treatment in a mouse
model. Tendons will be harvested and undergo mechanical testing both immediately following the training as
well as 12 months later to test the ability of early life exercise to enhance late life tendon quality. The formation
of the tendon core and its response to loading in early life will be assayed using histology and stable isotopes,
thus capturing the regional response of tendon to loading at these life stages."

Opioid use disorder (OUD) and obesity are major comorbid public health concerns that are increasing
in national prevalence. OUD contributes to approximately 68% of all drug overdose deaths in the U.S.,
and obesity is a leading source of all-cause mortality. Patients diagnosed with obesity are also frequently
diagnosed with chronic pain conditions and are more likely to be prescribed opioids. Further, obesity is
highly prevalent among individuals with OUD, and is associated with higher risk for opioid overdose.
This suggests that individuals with obesity have an increased risk both of being prescribed opioid
analgesics and developing OUD; however, the physiological mechanisms that underlie these risks are
not well understood. Obesity is linked to the consumption of high fat diets; however, it is not known if
the risks related to OUD among patients diagnosed with obesity are due to this dietary history. This NIH
SuRE R16 proposal investigates the impact of diet on the therapeutic, rewarding, and adverse effects
of morphine, using behavioral and physiological assays in rats. Further, given recent evidence
suggesting that high fat, low carbohydrate ketogenic diets might have beneficial effects for obesity, the
proposed aims will also explore the effects of a ketogenic diet in addition to a low fat diet control
condition. To explore the impact of diet on sensitivity of rats to morphine, animal models of the
therapeutic effects of morphine (i.e., antinociception indexed via warm water tail withdrawal and von
Frey paw withdrawal assays) and reward (i.e., conditioned place preference and behavioral
sensitization) will be examined in Aim 1. Additionally, the adverse effects of morphine including
constipation (decreased gastrointestinal transit) and dependence (as measured by the presence or
absence of withdrawal symptoms following chronic morphine administration) will also be explored in Aim
2 to mimic the experiences of patients taking opioids chronically for pain management or recreational
use. Finally, in Aim 3 this proposal will also evaluate changes in molecular markers within specific brain
regions associated with reward processing, feeding, and nociception, to identify targets for future
mechanism-driven assessments. These projects will provide a clear picture of the ways that dietary
history might impact the therapeutic effectiveness of opioids, as well as their abuse liability, providing a
translationally relevant assessment focused on two converging and increasing public health concerns:
obesity and OUD. These aims will also involve the training of underrepresented minority graduate and
undergraduate students, at a Hispanic-Serving Institution, the University of Texas at El Paso, under the
direction of the PI, who is also an underrepresented minority scientist. Students will be involved in all
stages of the proposed aims including experimental design, data collection, data analysis and
interpretation, and will become first- or co-authors on publications and presentations."

The aim of our multidisciplinary program is to train postdoctoral biomedical, behavioral, health care and other
public health scientists to conduct innovative and rigorous addiction treatment research. An overarching goal is
to enhance the scientific reasoning skills needed to advance treatment options for people who struggle to
reduce their substance use. From our perspective, such research will benefit from interventions guided by
sophisticated and fully developed theory using a multidisciplinary framework that includes the biological,
psychological, social, cultural, and policy context in which interventions occur. Distinctive features of our
training program are that it is interdisciplinary; that it embraces no single ideology or theory concerning the
nature of dysfunctions related to drug use; that it provides training in early intervention and treatment along a
continuum; and that it provides trainees with highly individualized opportunities to develop competitive grant
applications and by doing so, contribute to the knowledge base of substance-related dysfunction and
treatment. The training experience is structured to provide individualized research experience and training,
complemented by a core academic curriculum to which 20% of fellows' training time is allocated. Four distinct
areas are covered in the curriculum: (1) statistics/research methodology; (2) grantsmanship; (3) ethical issues
in research; and (4) a two-year series of formal courses covering the etiology and treatment of substance use
from varying disciplinary perspectives. We also subscribe to a research apprenticeship model under the
guidance of the research mentor. Each fellow's individual research training experience emerges from an
individualized development plan developed by the fellow, agreed to by their mentor(s), and reviewed and
approved by the Training Committee. The program has a primary emphasis on training in innovative treatment
development and clinical trials research with a secondary emphasis on the translation of clinical research into
services research. Our research in behavioral economics, neuroscience, and pharmacotherapy expands our
focus of translational research from basic to clinical. An additional area of prominence in our training program
is tobacco regulatory science. The typical training program duration is two years, but we offer a third year when
needed. The program accepts on average two new fellows per academic year."

Sexual and gender minorities (SGM) are heavily burdened by HIV in the U.S., including cisgender sexual
minority men, transgender women and men, and non-binary people assigned male at birth. SGM also
experience vast health inequities outside of HIV, including mental health problems, substance use, and various
physical health outcomes. Minority stressors (i.e., those unique to SGM) are linked to HIV-related outcomes
and mental health, driven by various biopsychosocial processes. Further, these health issues do not occur in a
vacuum; multiple, comorbid health-related issues interact synergistically to form a “syndemic” that drives HIV
incidence and HIV care outcomes among SGM. In order to rapidly address these issues, we need skilled
translational scientists who can delineate the mechanistic processes driving disparities, translate findings into
interventions, and implement programs with communities. Built on the infrastructure of Northwestern's Institute
for Sexual and Gender Minority Health and Wellbeing, the TrainingProgram in Translational Science, HIV,
andSexual and Gender Minority Health (NU-THRIVE)will support promising scientists in building the skills
necessary to understand these complex relationships and mitigate health disparities impacting SGM people,
including HIV. NU-THRIVE aims to train postdoctoral fellows in research methods across the Translational
Science Spectrum through a rigorous program in which they will: 1) specialize and gain depth of knowledge in
2 Translational Science Skill Domains (i.e., Quantitative Methods, Qualitative Methods, Interventions & Trials,
Implementation Science) through mentored research; and 2) gain breadth of knowledge in all 4 domains
through a formal training curriculum. NU-THRIVE will support 3 new postdoctoral fellows per year, on 2-year
appointments. We expect a majority will have a PhD (behavioral/social science) and a minority will be MD
physician-scientists. Fellows will select 1 Primary and 1 Secondary Mentor. Primary Mentors are faculty who
focus primarily on HIV, mental health, and/or SGM health. Secondary Mentors come from a range of
disciplines and have expertise complementary to the aims of NU-THRIVE but may work outside of or adjacent
to HIV and mental health among SGM. Fellows will gain knowledge and skills in 8 core competencies: 1)
translational science in HIV & SGM health; 2) biopsychosocial drivers of HIV, mental health, & associated
comorbidities; 3) developmental lifespan & environmental influences on HIV, mental health, & comorbidities; 4)
intersectional identities, HIV, & SGM health; 5) team science skills; 6) ethics & responsible conduct of
research; 7) writing, dissemination, & grantsmanship; 8) professional & career development. NU-THRIVE
training modalities will include mentored research activities, a didactic seminar series, intensive trainings in
translational science methods, structured writing support, and other activities available in the rich Northwestern
environment. NU-THRIVE will place fellows at the forefront of HIV and SGM health research, with the goal of
more rapidly moving basic science discoveries to efficacious interventions and onward toward implementation."

This cancer education training project is designed to train oncology care providers to implement tobacco use
assessment and treatment (TUAT) in their cancer care settings. Persistent smoking is associated with cancer-
specific and all-cause mortality, increased likelihood for second primary cancer, increased risk for disease
recurrence, poor response to treatment and treatment-related toxicity. Leading oncology organizations have
strongly endorsed tobacco use assessment and treatment as an important metric for high quality cancer care
and evidence-based, clinical guidelines exist for assessment and treatment of tobacco use and dependence
among cancer patients. Unfortunately, barriers for implementation are many, and adoption of TUAT into real
world oncology practice settings remains slow and inconsistent. Although recent surveys demonstrate that
oncology providers agree that advising tobacco cessation is an important aspect of cancer treatment planning
and that some progress has been made at offering tobacco treatment services as NCI-Designated Cancer
Centers, most cancer care settings have not yet established tobacco cessation treatment as standard care,
and there exists a lack of training and implementation support needed to achieve TUAT innovation in cancer
research and care. To address this continued research-to-practice gap, renewal of this cancer education grant
will support refinement and enactment of our current well-received TUAT skills development course and
collaborative training program intended to accelerate oncology care providers’ efforts to implement TUAT for
tobacco-dependent patients treated in their respective cancer care facilities. Our proposed skills development
effort will be enacted during a 6-month period of active training engagement beginning with a 2-day onsite or
virtual Workshop followed by six monthly videoconferences (Collaboratory) co-facilitated by Program Faculty
with extensive TUAT expertise in cancer. This proposed renewal of this skills development course will enable
us to enroll 15 additional cohorts (20 participants/cohort) enabling us to train an additional 300 multidisciplinary
participants from diverse cancer practice settings. To date, there has been the strong demand for TTT-O from
a large number of oncology care providers from multiple disciplines and a wide variety of cancer care settings.
We have exceeded our initial enrollment projects and successfully trained 286 oncology care providers.
Participant feedback regarding course content, faculty and format have been outstanding. The findings from
our multi-pronged evaluation plan demonstrate statistically significant improvements in TUAT knowledge,
attitudes, self-efficacy, skills, and behavior. Ultimately, this cancer education program will improve the capacity
of oncology care providers to implement clinical practice guidelines for tobacco use assessment and treatment
and reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality among cancer patients and survivors."
10819518,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Pulvinar (PUL) and Mediodorsal (MD) nuclei are higher order thalamic structures that are known to play
critical roles in various cognitive domains. However, the precise mechanisms are unknown, with theories
suggesting their role in either gating or facilitating functional connectivity across their cortical targets.
Imoprtantly, recent evidence from schizophrenia patients suggests that these higher order thalamic-cortical
interactions are perturbed and may even be causative to disease etiology. In this Center, we have assembled
a group of investigators who will utilize behavior, electrophysiology, imaging in human and non-human
animals to 1. Identify cognitive functional organization principles of higher-order thalamic nuclei in interacting
with cortex; 2. Translate thalamic functionality from animal models to the healthy and diseased human brain;
and 3. Develop a biologically plausible model for the human higher-order thalamus. The Center will be divided
into 5 Scientific Projects and 3 Cores. Project 1 (PI Usrey) will combine electrophysiology and optical
perturbations to study interactions between PUL and early visual cortical areas during attentional processing.
Project 2 (PI Kastner) will take a large-scale network approach in the macaque to study interactions between
the primate-specific mdPUL subdivision and fronto-parietal networks in attention, and also study interactions
between the MD and frontal cortical areas in hierarchical reasoning and task switching. Project 3 (PI Halassa)
will combine optical perturbations, electrophysiology and disease modeling in Tupaia to study interactions
between PUL regulation of dorsal vs. ventral stream selection in attention, and MD regulation of frontal cortical
interactions in hierarchical reasoning. Project 4 (PI Collins/Arcaro) will combine functional neuroimaging and
behavior in humans to interrogate PUL and MD engagement with their cortical partners in attention and
hierarchical reasoning, respectively. This will begin an exciting endeavor of determining what types of higher
order thalamic contributions to cognition have expanded in the human brain. Project 5 (PI Woodward) will
examine behavior-brain relationships (attention-PUL and decision making-MD) in schizophrenia patients,
where the structural integrity of higher order thalamic connectivity to cortical partners is known to be impaired.
Core A (PIs Kastner, Halassa and Usrey) will administratively manage this Center and involve important
outreach and training activities. Core B (PI Chen) will provide analytical support for all projects and streamline
data collection, curation and sharing across PIs with common format, as well as allow for data sharing with
the broader community. Core C (PI Kopell) will generate computational models that will be iteratively refined
by the collected data and provide testable prediction on an ongoing basis. Altogether, successful launching
of this Center promises to provide new frameworks for the neural circuitry underlying cognitive processing
and how the thalamus may be a target for enhancing cognition in schizophrenia."
10819519,"ABSTRACT
The overall goal of the Center is to derive a biologically plausible model for human thalamus function by
identifying and modeling functional organization principles of higher-order thalamic computations and
interactions between thalamus and cortex. The goal of Core A is to provide administrative support to all center
projects and cores and coordinate their activities under the leadership of Dr. Kastner. This includes plans to
facilitate information transfer and data sharing among projects and cores, to disseminate knowledge gained by
Center activities to the scientific community and public (including a comprehensive educational outreach
program), and to provide training and professional development opportunities. The Center comprises five
projects and two cores led by eight PIs/Co-Is from eight institutions, who represent a wide range of methods and
expertise including multimodal neuroimaging in neurotypical and clinical human populations, and intracranial
electrophysiology in non-human primates and tree shrews. The close collaborative links and synergy across the
projects and cores that will be critical to the success of the proposed Center necessitate a high level of scientific
and administrative oversight and coordination across the different Center components. Core A will have the
following aims: 1. To provide oversight over all scientific activities of the Center components by facilitating
communication through regular Center meetings of the Steering Committee (comprised of the Center Director
and all PIs/Co-Is), the whole Center community, and the external consultants, and by establishing an External
Advisory Board, in consultation with NIH; 2. To provide oversight over all administrative responsibilities such as
the budget and resource allocation, annual reporting and maintaining a Center website; 3. To provide training
opportunities, particularly considering underrepresented minorities, and to develop an educational outreach
program."

The primary goal of this proposal is to optimize our promising CD46 directed radioimmunotherapy method and
to systematically test the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity utilizing state of the art metastatic cancer models.
Readouts of therapeutic efficacy and toxicity will include histologic, metabolomic, and microscale dosimetry
analysis. Our preliminary data and prior publications demonstrate great promise for CD46 directed
radioimmunotherapy. The central hypothesis is our proposal is that optimized CD46 directed
radioimmunotherapy will allow for effective prostate cancer treatment with relative sparing of normal tissue
toxicity. This hypothesis will be tested in relevant orthotopic and disseminated metastatic models, using readouts
including histology, metabolomic, and microscale dosimetry analysis.
Guided by PAR-22-139, we have assembled a multidisciplinary multi-PI team including nuclear medicine
physicians, specialists in cancer metabolism and animal model development, physicists, radiochemists, experts
in antibody drug development, and pathologists. In aim 1, we develop novel bifunctional chelators for antibody
labeling to maximize tumoral delivery of the therapeutic 225Ac. In aim 2, we systematically test the optimized
radioimmunotherapy agents in clinically relevant metastatic prostate cancer models. In aim 3, we develop a
multi-part therapeutic and toxicologic readout incorporating metabolomic, histologic, and microscale dosimetry
analysis. Overall, the methods developed in this proposal promise to advance CD46 directed
radioimmunotherapy, and will have significant impact upon the field of radiopharmaceutical therapy in general."

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and devastating cause of acute respiratory failure.
There are 200,000 annual ARDS cases in the U.S. (2.5-5 million globally), which account for 60,000 deaths
and enormous physical, cognitive, and psychosocial morbidity among survivors. Yet, despite more than 200
randomized clinical trials (RCTs), only two interventions – low-tidal-volume ventilation and prone positioning –
have definitively improved outcomes using a traditional frequentist, null hypothesis, p-value-based trial design
and analysis. The research team contends that assessing data in this framework may overlook informative trial
data and delay or thwart the identification of promising therapies, especially when p-values fall just short of the
0.05 threshold, which has occurred in several major ARDS trials. As an alternative methodological approach to
maximize the clinical insight gained from RCTs, the team will reanalyze 29 international and NHLBI-funded
ARDS RCTs that enrolled more than 15,000 individuals using Bayesian causal inference and machine learning
methods they have developed and validated. Most therapies they will examine are either low-cost or easily
implemented practices and thus have the potential for high impact (e.g., ventilator settings, fluid management,
corticosteroids, statins, beta-agonists, vitamin D). In Aim 1, instead of using statistical significance, they will
quantify the probability of a beneficial treatment effect and its probable magnitude. That is, instead of using a
pre-specified p-value to determine whether an intervention has at least the hypothesized mortality benefit, they
will derive the probability that a given therapy is associated with clinically relevant absolute mortality reductions
of at least 2%, 4%, and 6%. They will examine each intervention with noninformative Bayesian ‘priors’ and then
with standardized and meta-analysis-derived priors to reduce subjectivity and interrogate clinical efficacy
across the spectrum of harm and benefit possibilities. In Aim 2, they will use Bayesian Additive Regression
Trees (BART) formulations they developed to understand which ARDS patient types are most likely to benefit
from, or be harmed by, a therapy, i.e., so-called ‘heterogeneity of treatment effect’ (HTE). Unlike prior HTE
research in ARDS, their approach does not focus on one-by-one, binary splits of characteristics but rather can
identify complex, multivariable, nonlinear treatment effect modification. Aim 2a will focus on mortality and
adverse events. Aim 2b will apply a novel BART variation to identify HTE in outcomes such as ventilator
duration or hospital stay whose observation is truncated by death. By estimating causal effects on these
outcomes among always-survivors, their new method avoids biases associated with prior approaches,
enabling accurate identification of clinically meaningful subgroups. Aim 3 focuses on developing and
disseminating free, cloud-based software to support future ARDS trials. This work promises to improve the
value of the knowledge gained from past and future ARDS RCTs by identifying truly beneficial treatments and
informing how these therapies can be individually tailored for this high-mortality, high-morbidity syndrome."

11128393,"Abstract: Advancement in high-resolution microscopy has opened unprecedented opportunities to investigate cells and tissues spatially at sub-micron level, via molecular imaging of gene transcripts, proteins or metabolomes. Parallel advances in computer-based hardware technologies and AI/ machine learning (ML) also offer a vehicle to study such multi-omics data in high dimensionality. An outstanding challenge involves a fusion of such data and thorough understanding of the fused data in all possible domains, including in basic science, clinical or pre-clinical studies using model systems, clinical diagnosis, prognostication, and drug discovery. Human Bio-Molecular Atlas Project (HuBMAP) consortium is an avenue for generating high-resolution multi-omics data at single cell resolution using a multitude of spatial molecular omics technologies. Common imaging modality that connects all these data types is brightfield histology microscopy, which is inexpensive and integrates the above-mentioned multi-omics data with clinical decision making. This HIVE Tools proposal aims to develop and implement novel machine learning pipelines to predict cell types and/or states from brightfield histology images using spatial protein- and/or RNA-based technology data with concurrent brightfield histology.  This will enable using these spatial omics data as a bridge to link histology with high content single cell data sets and thus create a single exploration space from histology to biomolecules in distinct cell types.  As a first step, we will employ select data collected under HuBMAP or generated via this HIVE team using CODEX as well as spatial transcriptomics (ST), and develop the proposed computational pipeline.  We will demonstrate mapping of cell types and cell states to brightfield histology images on the same section from which the molecular data are generated, as well as on the independent adjacent section via registration, and finally on an independent validation tissue section. We will subsequently explore application of this approach to other HuBMAP organs including lymph node, skin, liver and lung.  We will also develop 3D scalable graphics of cell types being detected using our pipeline, with a goal to develop ontological framework integrating atoms to anatomy for an objective understanding of variability in reference human atlas. We will create synergies with other HIVE teams to integrate the developed pipelines, tools with HuBMAP web-cloud portal as an easy-to-use, plug-and-play end-user plugin that is openly accessible to quantify cell counts, types, features, as well as states via uploading brightfield histology tissue images to the portal. Our innovative translational science teams’ model will recruit underrepresented minority students in STEM from biology as well as from engineering disciplines to provide them a mentorship environment and scientific opportunities within our team and that of collaborators. This strategy will develop a next generation renaissance scientist, who will be able to continue investigating along the proposed direction combining knowledge from biology, imaging, and engineering in a single research project."

Acute and chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain are important health concerns across the lifespan, and surgery
is a chief inciting event for subsequent persistent pain. Eighty percent of adolescents undergoing major MSK
surgery report severe acute pain, and 20% develop chronic postsurgical pain. Having chronic pain in childhood
and adolescence increases risk for a continued negative trajectory of MSK pain and poor health outcomes in
adulthood, contributing to the national pain crisis. This K24 award will provide critical support for Dr. Rabbitts, a
NIAMS-supported Associate Professor of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine at the University of Washington
(UW). The candidate's programmatic research has focused on developing innovative methods to identify
biopsychosocial contributors to acute and chronic pain following MSK surgery in adolescents. During the
course of this award, she will complete currently supported research: R01AR073780 which aims to increase
understanding of the transition from acute to chronic postsurgical pain and the causal mechanisms involved,
and UH3HD102038 (HEAL clinical trial) which evaluates the effectiveness of an mHealth perioperative
psychosocial intervention to reduce acute and chronic pain in adolescents undergoing major musculoskeletal
surgery. The candidate will expand her interprofessional mentoring program to build a strong and diverse
cohort of pain scientists equipped to develop and implement long-term solutions to the MSK pain crisis through
prevention. This K24 will also allow extension of the candidate's perioperative research program through
training in sleep methodologies and building new collaborations to forge a novel research direction focused on
sleep. The specific aims of the two new research studies proposed are to: 1) test pain processing as a
mediator in the relationship between adolescent sleep immediately following surgery and subsequent MSK
pain at 2 months after spine surgery, and 2) to determine feasibility of peri-operative melatonin in youth
undergoing MSK surgery. The four projects will provide mentees with rigorous methodological training in a
broad range of pain research assessment and intervention methods. This will capitalize on the wealth of
opportunities available at SCRI and UW to actively engage promising trainees in the candidate's role as a
physician-scientist, including via the SCRI Pediatric Pain Research Postdoctoral Fellowship and the UW T32
Training Program in Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine Research. Release from clinical activities
provided by this award will allow the candidate to expand mentees at the fellow level, while enhancing
mentorship skills, to equip a new generation of pain researchers with necessary scientific and professional
skills, resiliency, and commitment to pain science, to make a sustained impact on the pain crisis. The K24 will
also accelerate the candidate's research momentum informing the Type II renewal of her R01 and a new U01
efficacy trial of perioperative melatonin, which will be critical to her career objectives to achieve a deep
understanding of contributing mechanisms and intervening to prevent acute to chronic MSK pain transition."
10983507,"ABSTRACT
Dentists are the leading prescriber of opioids to adolescents and young adults (AYAs), even though opioid use
after tooth extraction is not associated with improved pain control or satisfaction. In AYAs, an opioid prescription
after a dental procedure increases the risk of opioid misuse, use disorder, and overdose. The long-term goal of
this project is to develop a framework to reduce opioid prescriptions to AYAs for treatment of acute dental pain.
The objective of this proposal is to establish the effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention at reducing
dental opioid prescription rates after tooth extraction in AYAs. Our central hypothesis is that a multicomponent
intervention is required to produce significant reductions in post-extraction opioid prescriptions to AYAs. The
rationale underlying this proposal is that a multicomponent intervention will address provider knowledge,
motivation, and choice architecture better than a single-component strategy; will engage and educate patients;
and will provide a physical item for distribution instead of an opioid prescription. We will test this hypothesis by
pursuing four specific aims: in the UG3 period, 1) complete requisite preliminary work to test a new approach
to manage acute pain following dental treatment, and in the UH3 period: 1) establish effectiveness of a novel
educational and drug-dispensing approach using academic detailing, patient education, and blister-packaged
non-opioid analgesics to reduce opioid prescriptions following tooth extraction among AYAs; 2) examine key
implementation outcomes of the intervention designed to modify dental professional decision-making behaviors;
and 3) assess patient-reported pain management, analgesic use, and drug disposal after tooth extraction. To
accomplish these aims, we propose a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial of community and academic clinics
across Kentucky using an innovative intervention of one-on-one provider education plus provider distribution of
patient education materials and standardized blister packs containing acetaminophen and ibuprofen. This study
will be conducted across at least 10 of the largest oral surgery practices in Kentucky, enrolling at least 27
providers expected to perform tooth extractions on over 40,000 AYAs. We will assess effectiveness using a
primary endpoint of the patient-level binary indicator of being prescribed an opioid. Secondary endpoints
include intervention acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and fidelity (UH3 aim 2); and patient-reported pain,
pain interference, analgesic use, and drug disposal (UH3 aim 3). The proposed research is significant because
it will provide a framework for wide-scale implementation of interventions to modify dental decision-making
behaviors towards evidence-based recommendations for acute pain management, resulting in a reduction in
opioid prescription rates after tooth extraction. The expected outcome is a framework to implement effective
interventions to reduce dental opioid prescribing to AYAs. The results will have a positive impact immediately
because they will limit unnecessary opioid exposure, and long-term because they will help dentistry build a
framework for reducing the impact of substance use disorders across the United States."
10814402,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 A broad range of major diseases ranging from diabetes to neurodegenerative
disorders including Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's (PD) and Huntington's (HD) diseases
have been linked to protein misfolding and aggregation. Normal protein homeostasis
(proteostasis) in the cytosol and nucleus is maintained by networks of factors that
promote protein folding (molecular chaperones) or clearance of terminally misfolded
substrates (ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), autophagy). Cells grow and proliferate
under the constant threat of intrinsic and extrinsic proteotoxic stressors including
reactive oxygen species (ROS), exogenous oxidants and reactive electrophiles.
However, the interface between proteostasis and cellular reduction-oxidation (redox)
buffering pathways, namely the thioredoxin and glutathione systems, is not well
understood. Our long-term goal is a comprehensive understanding of the biological roles
of cytoprotective chaperones, the machinery employed to maintain redox balance and
the interplay between them. In this MIRA application we define two independent themes
that define our future research program. In the first line of investigation, we will examine
redox modulation of cytoplasmic spatial protein quality control and degradation,
empowered by our discoveries that the sequestrase Hsp42 accumulates with misfolded
proteins and is required for optimal growth in redox-deficient yeast cells that lack a
functional thioredoxin system. We have also uncovered a new arm of the endoplasmic
reticulum-based unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway that is activated in
thioredoxin-deficient cells and operates independently of the primary UPR transcription
factor Hac1; we will elucidate the mechanism and biological relevance of this alternate
cytoprotective system. The second broad direction will expand our studies of metazoan
chaperone mechanisms with both biochemical and animal-based studies using
Drosophila based on our discovery of a novel intrinsically disordered region (IDR) in fly
and human Hsp110 chaperones with powerful anti-aggregation and anti-amyloid
properties. The work outlined in this proposal will expand on our past successful studies
of cellular redox and protein quality control networks, exploiting tractable yeast and fly
model systems. These results in turn will guide future development of therapeutic
interventions targeting ROS- and protein quality control-based disorders."

The overall aim of this study is to identify social and biological pathways of racial/ethnic disparities for incident
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)/ Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD) and cognitive decline that
emerge in middle age. We have recruited over 1,500 middle-aged offspring of participants in the Washington
Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP), and characterized them at baseline using measures of
neuropsychological and psychosocial function, lifecourse measures of social and environmental determinants of
health, stored blood samples, and brain structure with MRI. The Offspring study is unique among other cohorts,
with large numbers of Latinx and African American participants in middle age who are not a convenience sample
and are representative of their age and cultural groups, and whose parents are well-characterized with directly
observed clinical and biological data. Our prior work in the Offspring cohort found 1) lower memory and executive
function among middle aged people whose parents have MCI/AD, particularly among non-Latinx Whites
compared with non-Latinx Blacks and Latinx, 2) among Whites, parental cognition had a stronger impact on
offspring hippocampal volume, and among Blacks, parental cognition had a stronger impact on offspring WMH,
3) the negative impact of age on cognitive function and cortical thickness is disproportionately large among Black
and Latinx participants compared with Whites, 4) early life social factors such as parental SES promote cognitive
resilience to parental AD history, and 5) racial discrimination has a disproportionate negative impact on cognitive
test performance among Black and Spanish-speaking Latinx offspring relative to White offspring. Over the next
5 years, we propose to recruit additional offspring for a total sample of 2,500, obtain baseline MRI scans on an
additional 1,000 participants, obtain plasma biomarkers for AD risk and neurodegeneration on baseline blood
samples, and obtain two repeat assessments of cognitive, psychosocial, and medical function. Our overarching
hypothesis is that vascular and inflammatory pathways of transmission of parental AD risk play a greater role
among Black and Latinx older adults compared with Whites, and that socioeconomic status, educational quality,
and experience of discrimination will moderate the relationship between parental AD status and biomarkers of
AD on Offspring cognition. Specifically, the project will 1) examine the impact of biological markers of vascular
and inflammatory health, AD pathophysiology, neurodegeneration, biological aging, and genetic risk on cognitive
decline and incident impairment across race/ethnicity and sex/gender and 2) determine the lifecourse
educational, economic, and social moderators of parental AD risk and AD biomarkers on cognitive decline and
incident impairment across race/ethnicity and sex/gender."
10898589,"SUMMARY: CORE C 
Cachexia is a wasting syndrome that significantly contributes to the morbidity and mortality of cancer patients, 
especially those diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The overarching hypothesis of this 
P01 project is that the NF-κB/IL-6/STAT3 signaling axis acts as a central regulator of the macroenvironment in 
PDAC-induced cachexia, encompassing tumor, skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. Three projects in this P01 
focus on specific components of this signaling axis integrating on the use of mouse models and patient samples. 
The role of the Immunophenotyping Core will be to support molecular and histological studies in the projects 
requiring next generation single cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) and multispectral imaging. In addition, the 
Immunophenotyping Core will use deep learning methods to perform the quantitation of multiplex images of 
immune cells to assess the function of the NF-κB/IL-6/STAT3 signaling axis in the progression of PDAC and 
wasting of muscle and adipose tissues in cachexia. The two specific aims of the Immunophenotyping core is to 
1) Utilize multiplex immunofluorescence panels and multispectral imaging to evaluate how the NF-κB/STAT3/IL- 
6 signaling axis regulates the immune architecture contributing to PDAC tumor progression and muscle and 
adipose wasting; and 2) Perform single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to reveal functional pathways 
regulated by the NF-κB/STAT3/IL-6 signaling axis in the macroenvironment of murine models of PDAC-induced 
cachexia."

This application is submitted in response to RFA-HD-18-011, Child Health Research Career
Development Award (CHRCDA) Program to provide K12 awards through the CHRCDA mechanism
to young pediatric investigators. This new application requests resources to support three
pediatricians each year who hold MD or MD/PhD degrees and have completed scholarship training
in a clinical subspecialty. The rationale for the program is based on the well-documented and urgent
need to support mentored career development for pediatricians to enable them to become fully
independent and productive basic science researchers, and the fact that the department of
Pediatrics at UCSF has the vision, experience and infrastructure to train the next generation of
leaders in pediatric science. Our aims are to (1) offer a structured program for training academic
pediatricians, (2) foster career development and promote retention of junior faculty, (3) expose
promising early career pediatricians to the intellectual richness of UCSF research and (4) promote
diversity in academic pediatrics. The scholars trained by this program will bring state-of-the-art
approaches to bear on diagnosis, treatment and prevention of health problems in children as well as
childhood onset of adult illness. The design of this program involves harnessing the expertise of world-
class basic laboratory scientists who will serve as mentors for interdisciplinary training. The basic
science training program is focused around eight scientific cores: cancer, cardiopulmonary medicine,
developmental biology, genetics, immunology, neurobiology, stem cell biology, and our new
computational sciences core. Each core has a Director, designated faculty, and a specific didactic
curriculum. The scholars, in conjunction with their mentor and Core Director, will also participate in
a program of additional discipline-specific course work dependent on both the prior experience and
training of the applicant and the scientific theme of the trainee’s research, which may often overlap
amongst different cores. In this application, we provide evidence that the Department of Pediatrics
together with the broader UCSF research community comprise an exceptional environment for
preparing young pediatricians who will receive support through the CHRCDA mechanism for
successful careers as basic science researchers. There are > 1,200 research laboratories and >
2,200 active research projects at UCSF, and the faculty includes 5 Nobel laureates, 64 members
of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 76 members of the Institute of Medicine, and 18
Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators. This program is an investment in the future of
children's health, as the diverse group of researchers we will train will harness advanced research
strategies to address urgent problems that will result in new treatments to improve child health."

Tuberculosis remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, despite the
widespread availability of effective treatment and prevention measures. Prisons harbor
among the highest rates of tuberculosis worldwide, and, in many regions, tuberculosis
burden in correctional settings is growing. The WHO now recommends active case
finding for tuberculosis in prisons and other high burden settings, but there is a dearth of
evidence for how to accurate and efficiently identify cases early to reduce transmission.
To address these gaps, we propose to a prospect cohort study among incarcerated
individuals in high tuberculosis burden prisons in Central Western Brazil to: 1) evaluate
the use of portable, digital x-rays with automated interpretation for intensive case finding;
2) determine whether genomic data can be used to track transmission rates at the
population level; and 3) use mathematical models to identify effective, scalable
strategies for tuberculosis case finding and prevention in prisons. We will test the
hypotheses that: 1) x-ray with automated interpretation can achieve WHO target product
profile thresholds for accuracy as a screening test among incarcerated individuals, even
among those with asymptomatic or early disease; 2) emerging phylodynamic methods
can be used to monitor trends in transmission; and 3) serial screening combined with
preventive therapy would be a cost-effective and impactful approach for tuberculosis
control in high-burden prisons globally. Overall, this project will address critical gaps in
tuberculosis diagnosis and prevention among a large, underserved, high-risk population,
to protect their health and the health of their communities."
10831829,"Uterine cancer is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the U.S., with a two-fold higher risk of mortality
for black women than white women. Early diagnosis is vital for patients’ prognosis as it greatly improves the
effectiveness of subsequent treatment. Evidence has shown a significant black-white difference in uterine
cancer stage at diagnosis (53% of black women versus 69% of white women are diagnosed at early stage),
which explains more of the racial gap in mortality risk than any other factor. However, there has been little
research elucidating barriers in the diagnostic pathway that lead to this disparity in early diagnosis, and
reasons for the more advanced-stage uterine cancer in black women remain largely unclear, hindering our
ability to address this important health inequity. Since many factors in the diagnostic pathway may be
modifiable and amenable to interventions, this reflects a lost opportunity of secondary prevention (i.e., early
detection and control of the cancerous process). The overarching objective of this project is to reduce racial
disparity in the early diagnosis of uterine cancer by systematically examining patients’ diagnostic pathway and
identifying barriers to early diagnosis in black women. We will achieve this objective via the following specific
aims: 1) to examine racial disparity between black and white women with uterine cancer in the quality of
diagnostic evaluation they receive; 2) to compare symptoms and diagnostic evaluation of women who have
early versus advanced stage uterine cancer and examine their role in influencing racial disparity in stage at
diagnosis; and 3) to conduct a population-based patient experience survey and link to cancer registry data to
examine how sociocultural, behavioral and access barriers affect disparity in uterine cancer diagnosis. Aims 1-
2 will draw on three unique large healthcare databases that have patient-level indicators of race/ethnicity and
socioeconomic status, contain a complete record of patients’ diagnostic pathway starting from the time when
symptoms are reported to a provider, and cover a diverse patient population encompassing the commercially
insured, Medicaid enrollees, and Medicare beneficiaries. These databases include the Optum Clinformatics
Data Mart, the MarketScan Multi-State Medicaid Database, and the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End
Results (SEER)-Medicare database. Aim 3 will exploit the infrastructure of statewide cancer registries and the
latest technology of rapid case ascertainment to survey a population-based sample of women newly diagnosed
with uterine cancer about their experience. By further linking patient reported survey data to pathology/clinical
data in cancer registry, we can uniquely examine how sociocultural, behavior, and patient-perceived barriers
affect uterine cancer stage at diagnosis and the potential interplay between tumor characteristics (e.g.,
histologic type) and patient experience. Findings from this study will provide an essential evidence base about
causes of racial disparity in uterine cancer diagnosis. Such information can guide meaningful design of
targeted interventions to promote early diagnosis in black women and reduce disparity."
10758526,"Project Summary
Opioids potently control neuronal circuitry throughout the brain. Endogenous opioid peptides (EOs), produced,
packaged, and released by neurons, are synaptically released as the effectors in these pathways. EOs,
namely dynorphin and enkephalin, act at the same receptors as exogenous opioids, often by hyperpolarizing
target cells and inhibiting neurotransmitter release. The dense expression of dynorphin and enkephalin
throughout the hippocampus was first recognized in the 1970s, but functional characterization of endogenous
release of these peptides proved difficult due to the limited tools available. As a result, the role of EOs in
synaptic and circuit dynamics remains unclear. Furthermore, the opioid peptidergic system undergoes dramatic
alterations in epileptogenesis, thus underscoring the need to understand how EOs affect neuronal circuit
homeostasis and contribute to disordered network dynamics.
My long term goal is to examine the physiology of EO signaling and how it may contribute to epileptic circuits.
The proposed experiments will utilize mouse genetics, slice physiology, and novel biosensor technology to
interrogate the effects of EO release in the healthy and diseased hippocampus. In Aim 1, I will characterize the
pre- and postsynaptic effects of dynorphin and enkephalin signaling at the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse at two
target cell types: interneurons and pyramidal cells. Simultaneously, I will visualize opioid release to
characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics within the hippocampal circuit. In Aim 2, I will investigate the
functional role of dynorphin and enkephalin signaling in hippocampal hyperexcitability. By pharmacologically
inducing hyperexcitability in brain slices, I will dissect the roles of enkephalinergic and dynorphinergic
pathways in the acutely hyperexcitable circuit. Then, using epileptic mouse models, I will also study the effects
of EO signaling in the permanently rearranged circuit. Finally, I will assay the pro- or anti-convulsant effects of
evoked EO release in an in vivo seizure susceptibility model. This work will be among the first to explore
selective release of EO peptides at hippocampal synapses, and may provide insight regarding the therapeutic
potential of EOs in epilepsy. The training to carry out these experiments will develop my scientific competency
through close mentorships with highly motivated faculty, as well as coursework to support my development in
manuscript writing, grantsmanship, and presentation ability. I will develop proficiency in hypothesis
development and experimental design while growing my fund of knowledge in synaptic physiology, circuit
research, and translational science. In tandem, I will cultivate leadership and teaching skills within academic
medicine, as well as my community, to garner the qualities necessary to be an excellent clinician-scientist."

 As ligand-regulated transcription factors, nuclear receptors (NRs) evolved to respond to natural small
molecules, such as vitamins and lipids, translating endocrine and metabolic signals into changes in gene
expression. Our data, that ligand-dependent REV-ERB activity may regulate TH17 cell inflammatory responses,
suggests that the REV-ERBs natural endogenous ligand, heme, may function as a REV-ERB-dependent
signaling molecule in TH17 cells. Given the evidence that both intracellular and extracellular ligands regulate NR
activity in TH17 cells, defining ligand mechanisms of action and/or understanding the source and effects of heme-
dependent REV-ERB activity in TH17 cells may reveal signaling pathways underlying homeostasis vs.
pathogenesis. Our preliminary data suggests that REV-ERBa/heme dependent signaling may be required for
protection from inflammation in the gut (colitis). This coincides with recent evidence demonstrating that dietary
heme induces gut dysbiosis and aggravates colitis. Therefore, understanding how ligands, like heme, regulate
the REV-ERBs would be particularly valuable for understanding how environmental signals influence TH17 cells
and inflammation. Our overarching goals are to define the role of heme as an endocrine signaling molecule and
elucidate the ligand-mediated mechanisms that regulate REV-ERBa’s transcriptional activity and interacting
partners, thus driving repressive functions in TH17 cells during inflammatory processes. We will accomplish this
goal by identify heme’s role as a REV-ERBa-dependent signaling molecule in TH17 cells; establishing whether
heme-dependent REV-ERBa activity affects TH17-mediated inflammation in vivo; and defining how ligands affect
the REV-ERBa’s transcriptional partners and repressive function in TH17 cells. The proposed studies will address
fundamental questions regarding ligand-dependent REV-ERBa activity. Importantly, these insights will be
particularly valuable in understanding TH17-mediated disease development and may inform on future
pharmaceutical approaches."

Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) represents a promising, noninvasive methodology by which to test
causal mechanisms of human cognitive brain functions, and to translate systems neuroscience theory into
therapy. This proposal utilizes whole-brain individualized neural modeling to better understand and harness
the causal mechanisms by which tES modulates brain activity dynamics and cognitive functioning. The
proposed research addresses key limitations of previous tES cognitive-enhancement studies, including uncertain
mechanisms, efficacy, and individual variability, by drawing on an explicit neurocomputational architecture from
which to derive strong brain-behavior linkages. In particular, a primary strength of the proposed project is its
utilization of the Mesoscopic Individualized Neurodynamic (MINDy) modeling approach and platform previously
developed and validated by the investigative team. The proposed project provides an ambitious extension of our
prior work, by fully leveraging the MINDy platform to validate and test an innovative neural control engineering
approach for analyzing, predicting, and manipulating causal relationships between large-scale brain networks
(salience [SAL], frontoparietal control [FPN], default mode [DMN]) and their influence on cognitive function. We
build individualized MINDy models for each participant based on their resting-state electroencephalographic
(EEG) data, then further optimize model estimation through a novel closed-loop tES+EEG stimulation
protocol (Aim 1). We then apply MINDy to modulate brain network dynamics associated with attention and
cognitive control, drawing upon the influential triple-network model, by optimally stimulating the SAL network
in a model-guided manner to shift from a DMN-dominant to FPN-dominant mode, under resting-state EEG
conditions (Aim 2). Finally, we extend the stimulation protocol to cognitive task contexts (Aim 3), by
implementing model-guided shifts of FPN-DMN balance as participants perform a well-established experimental
paradigm probing attention and cognitive control (AX-CPT), testing for performance enhancements in terms
of theoretically-interpretable behavioral markers. The findings of this project will have high"
10792598,"Women living in the rural United States experienced a disproportionate increase in premature coronary heart
disease (CHD) mortality between 2009 and 2017 compared to other demographic groups, which otherwise
enjoyed a reduction in CHD events. Worsening mental health is a growing concern in rural areas and may
disproportionately affect rural women due to constraining gender stereotypes, lack of social and economic
resources, and limited access to care. These factors in turn may increase CHD risk in women through
autonomic, neuroendocrine, and inflammatory response pathways. We anticipate that both gender (social
constructs) and sex (biological factors) and their interplay are implicated. Our overarching hypothesis is that
rural women have disproportionally high exposure to social adversity and psychological stress, leading to sex-
specific hormonal, inflammatory, autonomic, and cardiovascular consequences that collectively increase CHD
risk. We also hypothesize that these effects are more likely to occur during women's reproductive years in part
through alterations in reproductive physiology and inflammation. Partnering with the ongoing RURAL (Risk
Underlying Rural Areas Longitudinal) cohort study, we will study a diverse sample of approximately 3,800
people of age 25-64 years from 10 rural counties in the Southern US undergoing detailed cardiovascular
phenotyping and psychosocial evaluation. We will examine everyday stress using a novel smartphone-based
tool and leverage data from wristband wearables to evaluate sleep and circadian patterns that in our studies
were associated with psychological stress. We will also examine cardiac autonomic function to provide insight
on brain-heart reactivity to daily stress with a novel multi-modal ambulatory heart monitor that measures
electrocardiography (ECG), pulse waveform, respiration, and movement. Finally, we will examine inflammatory
and reproductive hormonal pathways potentially related to both stress and CHD, to help understand the
disproportionately accelerated CHD risk in young women. In aim 1, we examine differences in social adversity
and mental health factors between women and men in rural communities, and in the relationship of these
exposures with cardiometabolic risk profile and subclinical CHD. In aim 2, we will examine differences in daily
stress and stress-related cardiovascular physiology between women and men by conducting a week-long
ecological momentary assessment with physiological monitoring to examine daily perceived mood/stress,
stressful life events, and corresponding autonomic stress responses with a multi-sensor chest patch that
examines both cardiac and vascular autonomic effects. In aim 3, we examine whether social adversity, mental
health factors, and stress in everyday rural life are related to immune alterations (interleukin-6) and
reproductive aging (anti-Mullerian hormone). This study will be the first to examine multifactorial
biopsychosocial determinants underlying disturbing trends in CHD among rural women and will sharpen our
understanding of sex-related disparities in young and middle-aged populations."

 Antipsychotics are a class of commonly used medications that are used for multiple
indications within psychiatry, including psychosis, mood stabilization, and augmentation for
depression. The use of antipsychotics among pregnant and lactating women has increased in
frequency in recent years. However, their efficacy has not been directly tested in this
population, and many unanswered questions remain about the potential effects of
antipsychotics on the development of the fetus, neonate, and infant.
 We propose to conduct a prospective observational study of maternal psychiatric course
and infant development among women with severe mental illness, comparing women treated
with antipsychotics to women treated with other medications or without medication. The primary
study outcomes will be psychiatric relapse in the mother, EEG abnormalities in the infant at 6
months, and behavioral and psychosocial outcomes at 18 months. We hope to determine
whether antipsychotics are effective for pregnant women with severe mental illness and whether
they have any measurable effects on infant development. This information will help women with
severe mental illness make informed decisions about their care in pregnancy."
10835856,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Chronic pain is a complex, medically unexplained disorder that poses enormous burden to both the patient and
the healthcare system. In the face of the opioid epidemic, the need for better scientific understanding of the
neuro- and psycho-biological underpinnings of chronic pain to guide improved treatment approaches is clear.
Non-pharmacological interventions, including contemplative and integrative practices, have shown efficacy in
improving pain and bolster efforts to reduce opioid-ergic medical management. These interventions often target
the processing of internal painful and non-painful sensory signals, referred to as interoception. Neural processing
of interoceptive stimuli overlaps with many of the regions altered in chronic pain, and self-report interoceptive
questionnaires and tasks show diminished interoceptive performance in pain patients. However, the translational
relevance of interoceptive functioning in pain treatment trajectories has been hindered by the lack of clear tasks
and questionnaire measures of interoception.
The overall objective of this proposal is to establish whether neural processing of non-painful interoceptive
stimuli, namely the heartbeat, is altered in chronic low back pain patients at various stages of treatment and
predictive of non-response to invasive peripherally-targeted treatments compared to healthy adults. This NRSA
project will identify how electrophysiological dynamics (EEG/ECG) are related to interoceptive processes and
pain treatment response using two newly developed, validated, and rigorously controlled interoception tasks that
assess neural responses to the heart (Heartbeat-Evoked Potential, HEP). I will systematically test the
hypothesis that chronic pain patients will display diminished modulation of the HEP during attention to
their heartbeat compared to healthy controls (Aim 1) and impaired interoceptive-exteroceptive
integration when an exteroceptive tone previously synchronized with the heartbeat is unexpectedly
omitted (Aim 2). I will also test that these measures at baseline can predict non-response to pain
intervention. Together, these data will establish whether neural markers of non-painful interoceptive processing
could be clinically relevant biomarkers for guiding treatment selection in chronic low back pain, and would have
broad implications for the incorporation of behavioral interventions targeting interoceptive processing. In
preparation for this NRSA, I have sought out mentors who have expertise in interoceptive tasks,
electrophysiology (EEG and ECG) data acquisition, analysis and interpretation, clinical interventional pain
management, and complementary and integrative pain care. This proposal was designed to give me the training
needed for a future profession as a Pain Management physician conducting research on interoceptive dynamics
in chronic pain, and their relation to healing with integrative medicine modalities."
10817707,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the impact of a novel race-based stress reduction program on
well-being, inflammatory burden, and DNA methylation (DNAm) in older African American (AA) women at risk
for cardiometabolic disease (CMD). Although the number of deaths related to CMD continues to decline, that
decline has slowed recently with AAs bearing a disproportionate burden. Furthermore, women face more sex-
specific risk factors for increased adiposity and AA women have the highest prevalence of obesity,
hypertension, and prediabetes compared to all other racial and ethnic groups. Chronic stress is associated with
low-grade inflammation and increased CMD risk. Growing evidence demonstrates that stressors such as
racism and discrimination are significant contributing factors to psychological distress, low-grade chronic
inflammation, and CMD health disparities among minorities, particularly among older AA women who endure
the intersection of both racism and sexism across their lifespan. Resilience, Stress, and Ethnicity (RiSE) is a
group-based, 8-week intervention that integrates cognitive-behavioral strategies focused on the
biopsychosocial impact of racism, racial identity development, and empowerment. Based on our preliminary
work, we anticipate that participation in RiSE will reduce psychological distress and inflammation. Further, our
previous work demonstrated that women with high levels of perceived discrimination have a greater
proinflammatory cytokine response to acute stress and decreased DNAm of genes related to inflammation and
hypertension. DNAm is one type of epigenetic process that modulates gene expression by adding or removing
methyl groups to DNA in response to the environment. Studies demonstrate that hyper or hypo methylation of
genes due chronic stressors, including racism and discrimination are significantly associated with CMD risk.
Emerging evidence demonstrates that psychobehavioral interventions may modify methylation of stress
response-related genes potentially buffering the impact of psychological stress at the molecular level.
However, few studies have examined the impact of a psychobehavioral intervention on changes in DNAm and
none have addressed chronic stress in older AA women.Therefore, the specific aims are: (1) Determine the
extent to which participation in RiSE decreases stress-related symptoms and inflammatory burden in older AA
women at risk for CMD; (2) Evaluate the extent to which RiSE increases the use of adaptive coping versus
maladaptive coping strategies in older AA women at risk for CMD; and (3) Determine the extent to which
participation in RiSE modifies DNAm of stress response- related candidate genes in older AA women at risk for
CMD from baseline to post RiSE intervention. AA women 50 to 70 years of age who are at risk for CMD will be
randomized into either an 8-week RiSE program or a health education program. RiSE is an innovative
intervention that addresses perceived racism and discrimination at the individual level. Further, RiSE has the
potential to improve the health of minority women impacted by racism and discrimination."
10808920,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common but serious mental illness that negatively affects emotion,
cognition, physical activity, and increases mortality. In general, the manifestation of depression is thought to be
due to the imbalance of neurotransmitters in the brain. These neurotransmitters include glutamate, GABA, and
especially a class of monoamines, such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. Many recent studies
have demonstrated the importance of dopamine homeostasis and dynamics on reward and motivation
especially after exposure to chronic stress. Our previous studies have identified a novel astrocyte-dependent
modulatory mechanism for the dopamine system, in which the hormone insulin regulates ATP release in
astrocytes, which in turn contributes to the modulation of dopamine release and depressive-like behavior in
mice. These exciting findings provide a novel and potentially important molecular basis for the etiology of
depressive disorders, given the epidemiological link between diabetes and major depression. How insulin
mediates astrocytic ATP release has yet to be elucidated, although exocytosis from secretory lysosomes has
been suggested as a major route of ATP release by astrocytes. Therefore, in the proposed research, we aim to
further investigate the molecular mechanism and functional relevance of the astrocytic insulin action and ATP
release on dopaminergic signaling under chronic stress. We hypothesize that insulin regulates the exocytosis
of ATP from secretory lysosomes in astrocytes to contribute to dopamine release, and impairment of this
astrocyte-initiated pathway will negatively impact dopamine release and exacerbate deficits in reward in mice
exposed to chronic stress. To test this central hypothesis, we have developed a new genetic mouse model, in
which we can specifically delete astrocytic vesicular nucleotide transporters (VNUTs) that are required for
loading ATP into secretory lysosomes. Consistent with our original findings, preliminary analyses show that
astrocyte-specific VNUTKO mice display increased depressive-like behavior and decreased activation of
medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens, indicating decreased dopamine signaling. Moving
forward, in Aim 1, we will continue to use astrocyte-specific VNUTKO mice to determine the role of ATP
exocytosis by astrocyte on dopamine signaling and reward in these mice after exposure to both unpredictable
chronic mild stress (CMS) and chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). In Aim 2, taking advantage of the highly
sensitive luciferase-based ATP quantification and the super-resolution living imaging by Nanoimager S, we will
quantify the insulin-induced lysosomal trafficking and exocytosis of ATP in cultured astrocytes. Further in vitro
and in vivo applications of pharmacological inhibitors and viral expression of mutations of key signaling
molecules will dissect the molecular mechanisms of insulin-stimulated ATP release by astrocytes. Together,
the proposed research will expand our understanding of the etiology of depressive disorders from a novel
perspective of insulin action in astrocytes and may reveal new therapeutic approaches for depression."

Upwards of 3.8 million concussions occur annually in the United States. Only 44% of concussed individuals
reduce their driving at any point following injury despite emergent concerns over post-concussion driving
safety, documented driving impairment, and reports of feeling unsafe driving after a concussion. Most
concussed individuals who reduce their driving only do so for 24-48 hours following the injury. Driving is a
highly complicated activity that requires visual, motor, and cognitive skills, which are commonly impaired after
concussion. Concussed individuals cross the centerline more frequently within 48 hours of injury and present
with poorer vehicle control throughout the full symptom recovery. Yet, the time course of post-concussion
driving impairment has not been characterized. There is a critical need to 1) determine when concussed
individuals should return to driving and 2) identify the key concussion assessment predictors of readiness to
return to driving. In the absence of formal recommendations, impaired concussed drivers are at risk to
themselves and others on the road. The first specific aim is to compare simulated driving between concussed
individuals and non-concussed yoked matched controls across five longitudinal timepoints (pre-injury baseline,
day 2, day 4, asymptomatic, and unrestricted medical clearance) and daily naturalistic driving from day 2 to
day 9. Driving recommendations must be appropriate and necessitated by concussion impairments, since
excessively strict recommendations wrongfully strip concussed patients of their independence and may
dissuade individuals from seeking medical care. The second specific aim is to identify widely used
concussion assessment outcomes that predict simulated driving performance among concussed individuals
throughout concussion recovery. To address these aims, 100 concussed and 100 yoked matched control
young adult college athletes will complete a simulated driving assessment and a robust concussion
assessment battery at pre-injury baseline, day 2, day 4, asymptomatic, and unrestricted medical clearance.
Naturalistic driving (measured with in-car global positioning systems) will be captured from day 2 to day 9 (7
days total). This study will determine the acute and subacute time course of post-concussion driving
impairment and determine key predictors of post-concussion driving performance. Results from this innovative
approach will have a broad and positive impact that will improve the safety of both concussed individuals and
the general population, guide the practices of health professionals, inform the future work of researchers, and
substantiate the work of policy-makers by providing evidence-based recommendations for managing post-
concussion driving."
10883551,"Background: Over 5 million Vietnam Veterans will be in their 70s in 2023, the age when metastatic prostate
cancer is commonly diagnosed – Black men and men exposed to Agent Orange at nearly twice the rate.
Fortunately, new therapies have improved survival for men with metastatic prostate cancer. However,
delivering new therapies to this growing group of men is complicated and raises concerns about equity, safety,
and Veteran experience.
Significance: This proposal will extend knowledge about barriers to guideline-concordant care faced by
Veterans with metastatic prostate cancer, the safety of treatment, and detail the Veteran’s experience with
metastatic prostate cancer. This proposal directly aligns with the Department of Veterans Affairs Fiscal Years
2022-28 Strategic Plan (Goals 1 & 2), to eliminate disparities and barriers to health, to enhance Veterans’
outcomes, experiences and quality of life, and to project future trends and needs by listening to Veterans. The
VA is the only institution that can perform such a timely and comprehensive study due to the unique VA-
developed natural language processing tool that allows rapid case ascertainment of men with metastatic
prostate cancer.
Innovation & Impact: This proposal has the potential to change current clinical practice through a future
multilevel intervention that mitigates barriers to treatment intensification and personalizes treatment to high -risk
Veterans. The innovative natural language processing tool allows rapid case ascertainment to prospectiv ely
identify new metastatic patients, which can only be done in the VA.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: To investigate factors affecting equitable care for men with incident metastatic prostate
cancer. Aim 2: To conduct real-time safety assessment of men treated for incident metastatic prostate cancer.
Aim 3: To understand physician and patient experience after diagnosis of incident metastatic prostate cancer.
Methodology: All patients will be age 18 or older with a diagnosis of incident metastatic prostate cancer. We
will prospectively identify Veterans using a natural language processing tool that can identify men with new
metastatic prostate cancer as soon as they are diagnosed in the VA. For Aim 1, we will use multilevel
multivariable models to assess the association of neighborhood deprivation, patient demographics, and facility
factors with receipt of guideline-concordant treatment intensification. Treatment intensification is defined as
androgen deprivation therapy plus either docetaxel or a secondary androgen signaling inhibitor (i.e.
abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide) within four months of metastatic diagnosis. For Aim 2, we will
compare frequency of emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and outpatient visits for conditions unrelated to
cancer the year after incident diagnosis of metastatic disease to similar events in clinical trials and a historic
cohort of VA patients. For Aim 3, we will survey a diverse sample of patients within four months of metastatic
diagnosis to understand their experience with receiving treatment for their cancer. We will also survey a
sample of physicians who treated these patients to understand their experience with barriers to delivering
treatment intensification.
Next Steps/Implementation: We will use the findings of this research to develop a multilevel intervention that
will mitigate barriers to equitable care delivery, and help clinicians inform patients about real-world risks of
treatment intensification. We will work with national partners to implement such an intervention in our next
proposal."

CHARGE syndrome is a complex of multiple congenital malformations and occurs in about 1:10,000
births worldwide. T cell Immunodeficiency is common (up to 80%) in CHARGE syndrome and is primarily due
to impairment in thymic development. CHARGE patients with a profound immunodeficiency is one of the
causes of complete DiGeorge syndrome that is due to thymic aplasia. Chromodomain helicase DNA‐binding 7
(CHD7) has been identified as the major causative gene in CHARGE syndrome. Most CHD7 mutations in
CHARGE patients are nonsense, missense, or frameshift, leading to loss-of functions of CHD7. CHD7
knockdown or knockout zebrafish embryos have severely impaired thymus organogenesis; CHD7+/- murine
embryos have thymic hypo/aplasia. However, it is unclear whether the thymic hypo/aplasia in CHD7 deficient
mice and CHARGE patients are due to a defect in the thymic microenvironment. Thymic epithelial cells (TECs)
are the major component of the thymic microenvironment for T cell development. TECs arise from thymic
epithelial progenitors (TEPs) that originate from the definitive endoderm (DE). We have reported that both
mouse and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be selectively induced to differentiate into TEPs in vitro.
When transplanted into mice, ESC-TEPs further develop into TECs, reconstitute the normal thymic
architecture, and support T cell development. We have also shown that CHD7 heterozygous deletion
(CHD7+/-) mouse ESCs (mESCs) have a reduced ability to develop into DE, TEPs and TECs, whereas
homozygous deletion (CHD7-/-) mESCs have more profound defects at each stage of the development. The
recent discovery of reprogramming human somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) opens a
new window of opportunity by providing an unlimited source of autologous cells for disease pathogenesis
studies and cell-based therapies. We have generated hiPSCs from somatic cells of a CHARGE patient
(CHARGE hiPSCs) and will generate more such hiPSCs. Since CHARGE syndrome is a haploinsufficiency
syndrome in humans, we hypothesize that the heterozygous effects of CHD7 on human DE, TEP and TEC
development from hESCs and hiPSCs are similar in nature to the homozygous effects on matching mouse
cells. We also hypothesize that correction of the CHD7 gene will rescue CHARGE hiPSCs from the defective
DE, TEP and TEC development, leading to normal ability to support T cell development in vivo. Two Specific
Aims are proposed to address the hypotheses: 1) to determine the ability of CHD7+/- hESCs and CHARGE
hiPSCs to develop into DE and TEPs in vitro and TECs in vivo; 2) to determine the ability of CHD7 gene
correction to enable CHARGE hiPSCs to develop into functional TEPs and TECs to support T cell
development. Our proposed studies will not only provide new insights into CHARGE pathogenesis, but also
have potential to lead to novel and powerful approaches to treat T cell immunodeficiency in CHARGE patients."
10840281,"Project Summary
 Tissue regeneration is the process of renewal, restoration and growth that allows an organism to re-grow
limbs and organs after injury. Tissue regeneration abilities are present in diverse organisms, suggesting they
may have been ancient, so the mechanisms controlling regeneration have been important to understand. The
freshwater planarian flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea regenerates from nearly any surgical injury, including
decapitation, and is a model for understanding the mechanistic basis of animal regeneration. After injury, tissue
near wound sites signals to nearby adult pluripotent stem cells called neoblasts, which differentiate to replace all
cell types of missing tissue. The highly conserved Wnt signaling pathway is essential for controlling regeneration
of anterior-versus-posterior tissue identity in planarian regeneration. The earliest event in head versus tail
determination is the injury induced expression of the secreted Wnt inhibitor notum selectively at anterior-facing
and not posterior-facing wound sites. However, the mechanism directing this symmetry breaking event is
unknown. Injury induced notum expression occurs from the soma of body wall muscle cells possessing
longitudinally aligned muscle fibers, suggesting a role of muscle cell orientation and polarity in the onset of
regeneration. However, the molecular signals and structure regulating this polarity are unknown, but classic
small molecule inhibition studies in planaria suggest a possible role for microtubules in this process. The goal of
this project is to uncover the mechanisms by which microtubules participate in the polarity of the regeneration
response in the following specific aims. Aim 1 utilizes RNAi to test roles for microtubule regulatory factors
expressed in muscle to control injury-induced gene expression at the onset of tissue regeneration. Aim 2 uses
epistasis analysis with RNAi to uncover the mechanism by which a kinesin microtubule motor protein relates to
a Wnt pathway for head and eye regionalization used in regeneration. These experiments will provide insight on
the cellular and molecular mechanism of microtubules during injury induced regeneration. My results will provide
new insights into understanding the other factors necessary for proper injury signal and help form a better
understanding on what regulates polarity."
10805425,"Project Summary
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a devastating autoimmune disease affecting over 1.25 million Americans that currently
has no cure. Therapies which target autoimmunity in T1D have shifted away from broadly immunosuppressive
agents such as cyclosporine, and now focus on enhancing immune tolerance. Low-doses of interleukin-2 (IL-2)
have been shown in pre-clinical and clinical trials to induce proliferation of regulatory Tcells (Tregs) which
promote immune tolerance and prevent autoimmune destruction of the insulin producing beta cell. Recently, it
has been shown in preclinical models that an IL-2/CD25 fusion protein induces greater proliferation of Tregs and
has a longer half-life than traditional recombinant IL-2. Studies on IL-2 and its analogues have focused on
mechanisms of immune tolerance and how it prevents loss of beta cell mass. Recent clinical findings
demonstrate that insulin secretion is impaired at least five years before diagnosis, while beta cell mass is still
preserved, suggesting that beta cell dysfunction, in addition to loss of beta cell mass, is critically important to the
pathogenesis of T1D. It is currently unknown how IL-2/CD25 therapy affects beta cell dysfunction. This
represents a critical gap in knowledge that must be addressed. Preliminary data shows that IL-2/CD25 induces
changes in the local immune infiltrate, increasing the proportion of Tregs and decreasing the proportion of
effector T cells (Teffs) at the islets. In vitro studies have shown that pro-inflammatory cytokines are released by
infiltrating Teffs and cause beta cell dysfunction via stress on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Therefore, I
hypothesize that IL-2/CD25 works to delay T1D progression by preventing cytokine-mediated beta cell
dysfunction, not just by averting cell death. I plan to test this hypothesis in the following specific aims: 1)
Determine how IL-2/CD25 treatment preserves islet function and glucose homeostasis, 2) Determine how IL-
2/CD25 treatment preserves islet tissue homeostasis. Under the first aim, I will use a novel approach using living
pancreas slices to analyze changes in insulin secretion and intracellular Ca2+ dynamics after IL-2/CD25
treatment. Under the second aim, I will identify the specific mechanisms involved in restoring islet homeostasis
after IL-2/CD25 therapy by using immunostaining and single-cell RNA sequencing for markers of stress,
proliferation, and dedifferentiation. My proposed study is significant because it will yield new information about
how changes in local immune infiltration mediated by IL-2/CD25 affect islet biology. This contribution is significant
because it will provide fundamental knowledge that will complete and revise models about immunotherapies for
T1D. This study supports the strategic plans of the National Institutes of Health which include advancing
opportunities in biomedical research by investing in fundamental science and developing treatments/cures for
disease."
10832501,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease characterized by dysregulated
interferon responses and loss of self-tolerance to cellular antigens that result in inflammatory processes that
ultimately lead to systemic end-organ damage. Striking genetic and clinical differences exist between European
American (EA) and African American (AA) SLE patients that result in disparities in their diagnoses, management
and outcomes. Despite decades of research and over 100 risk loci identified, the underlying mechanisms driving
the pathogenesis of SLE and its racial disparities remain incompletely understood. Our lab has joined forces with
the team led by Jason Buenrostro, PhD, at Harvard to evaluate and understand how epigenetic regulation in
specific cell types contributes to both disease- and race-specific SLE pathogenesis. We use a sci-ATAC-seq
(single cell indexing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin), method developed and optimized in the
Buenrostro laboratory, to assess disease- and race-specific differences in genome-wide chromatin accessibility
(CA) in cell subtypes from cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Integrating these data with
genotyping data allows us to identify allelically imbalanced variants that are enriched in regions of CA (caQTLs),
suggesting a mechanistic role for these variants in regulating CA. Our preliminary data conducted in EA SLE
and healthy controls demonstrate that we are able to define multiple major PBMC cell subsets, and that extensive
differential CA and caQTLs discriminate between SLE case and control subjects. We now propose an expanded
study that will not only evaluate disease-specific CA and caQTL alterations in a much larger sample, but also
race-specific alterations. Integrating single-cell transcriptomic data and clinical data with CA and caQTL data
will facilitate the functional interpretation of SLE relevant CA differences. Our goals for this AR077434
resubmission are to 1) define cell type-specific differences in chromatin accessibility that identify both disease-
specific and race-specific alterations; 2) identify cell type and race-specific caQTLs that associate with
differences in CA between SLE cases and controls; and 3) define the mechanistic relationships between CA,
caQTLs, gene expression architectures, within the context of cis co-accessibility networks. We believe this
project positions us at the leading edge to develop a precise epigenetic roadmap connecting genetic variation to
deleterious cellular and clinical phenotypes that underlie the disease-specific mechanisms of SLE and its
remarkable race-specific disparities."
10843743,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide and represents a significant economic
burden. Atherosclerosis, which is characterized by a build-up of inflammatory lipids and immune cells, is the
most common underlying cause of CVD. Early in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, LDL-cholesterol particles
infiltrate the lining of the artery wall, are modified (e.g., oxidized), and activate inflammatory pathways (e.g.,
NLRP3 inflammasome) triggering the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. A failure to resolve inflammation
within the artery wall leads to the development of a plaque. The current standard of care includes lipid-lowering
drugs such as statins. However, even with successful lipid-lowering, there remains a subset of patients with
residual inflammatory risk. These observations led to several large-scale clinical trials (e.g., CANTOS and Lo-
DoCo2) that targeted systemic inflammation to treat atherosclerotic CVD. These trials demonstrated that target-
ing systemic inflammation reduces adverse cardiovascular events, however, due to an increase in non-cardio-
vascular-related deaths, there are currently no FDA-approved anti-inflammatory therapies for atherosclerosis.
While targeting inflammation systemically has shown promise, it is important to identify more specific targets and
regulators of inflammation within the atherosclerotic plaque to leverage into novel therapies. Research over the
past few decades has established that the metabolic state of the immune cell determines its inflammatory ca-
pacity. As such, rather than targeting systemic inflammation, we propose to leverage the metabolic regulators of
inflammation within the cell. Studies of macrophages stimulated with inflammatory mediators including microbial
ligands and cytokines have revealed significant upregulation of the gene Immune-responsive gene 1 (Irg1, also
Acod1) and its downstream metabolite itaconate. In addition to being an anti-microbial agent, itaconate controls
immune activation and elicits immunological tolerance through (1) regulation of immune cell metabolism, (2)
inhibition of late-stage NLRP3 inflammasome activity, and (3) activation of the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxida-
tive transcription factors Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 and Activating transcription factor 3. While
Irg1 and itaconate have been studied in the context of acute inflammation, their role in chronic inflammatory
disease, such as atherosclerosis, has not been explored despite sharing many similar pathways.
In this proposal, I will define the role of Irg1 and itaconate on immune cell regulation in atherosclerosis, specifi-
cally the effects on three major immune cells within the plaque we have found to robustly express Irg1: mono-
cytes, macrophages, and neutrophils. Additionally, I will utilize in vivo mouse models of atherosclerosis to test
whether IRG1 deficiency exacerbates plaque burden and inflammation. Finally, I will elucidate the utility of 4-OI,
a cell-permeable itaconate derivative as a treatment in atherosclerotic CVD. If successful, this will demonstrate
for the first time the role of Irg1 and itaconate in chronic inflammation and identify a novel treatment modality for
the inflammatory component of atherosclerotic CVD."

providing a funding mechanism for pilot projects and provide intellectual, technical and instrumental
infrastructure. In Specific Aim 1, we will select teams of translational researchers (consisting of basic and clinical
scientists, with at least one early-stage investigator) for 3 pilot project awards ($50,000 per year for 2 years and
minimum of 6 awards for the duration of the program), with additional summer stipends for students from under-
represented groups to enhance diversity. The request for proposals will focus on projects with high potential of
translating basic research into clinical practice. In Specific Aim 2, we will provide structured, formal mentorship
(provided by senior, extramurally-funded investigators) for participating early-stage basic- and clinician-scientist
investigators focused on stem cell and aging research, regenerative medicine and age-related diseases to
facilitate their transition to research independence with extramural funding. In Specific Aim 3, we will promote
the utilization and sustainability of the SCA COBRE Core Facilities (developed in Phases 1 and 2, and including
Flow Cytometry, Extracellular Vesicles, Lentiviral Construct Core Facilities) through their utilization in the pilot
projects as well as through vouchers to affiliated scientists participating in the program. In the Specific Aim 4, we

10884881,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Latinos are disproportionately affected by type II diabetes. They have an age-adjusted incidence rate of 9.7 per 1000
persons, nearly double the rate for non-Latino Whites. Once diagnosed with diabetes, Latinos experience worse
glycemic control and diabetes-related complications compared to non-Latino patients. These inequities are driven by
multiple interrelated biological, cultural, and social factors. In particular, a lack of access to consistent care and difficulty
navigating the healthcare system are critical drivers of these disparities. By extending care beyond the clinic,
telemedicine presents an opportunity to address these challenges. Telemedicine offers patients video and telephone
visits from remote settings. However, current implementation strategies have created significant gaps in telemedicine
access and use among Latinos, especially those who are limited English proficient (LEP). The goal of this K23 is to address
this critical need by evaluating how a culturally and linguistically tailored implementation strategy can increase
telemedicine use by Latino patients with diabetes. My central hypothesis is that by applying a human-centered design
approach supported by implementation science, we can improve telemedicine use, an important part of addressing
diabetes disparities. The proposed project will test the central hypothesis with the following 3 specific aims. Aim 1 will
evaluate existing electronic health record data, telemedicine platforms, and workflows to identify multilevel
contributors to telemedicine use gaps among Latino patients with diabetes. Aim 2 will engage stakeholders to develop a
multilevel, tailored intervention targeted at patients and clinicians to promote telemedicine use in the care of Latino
patients with diabetes. Aim 3 will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the multilevel, tailored intervention
among Latino patients with diabetes and their clinicians. Through an innovative application of human-centered design
and implementation science, this proposal addresses overlapping health information technology and diabetes disparities
among Latino patients, especially those who are LEP.
The proposed research is complemented by a rigorous training plan and a highly experienced mentorship team that will
ensure my transition to independence. The training plan focuses on mixed-effect logistic regression, implementation
science, human-centered design, and trial design. This proposal will form the basis for an R01 application centering on a
larger clinical trial testing the effect of the implementation intervention on clinical outcomes among Latino patients with
diabetes."
10830925,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dystrophin deficiency, which occurs in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), results in muscle wasting. As
dystrophin is expressed in the brain, its deficiency also contributes to neurological symptoms in DMD patients.
Cerebellar Purkinje cells in mouse models of DMD have weaker inhibitory synaptic connections and
compromised climbing-fiber-evoked plasticity. This implicates cerebellar dysfunction as a contributing factor to
the neurological pathophysiology of DMD. Yet, how cerebellar dysfunction ultimately explains DMD neurological
symptoms remains incompletely understood. Increasing evidence points to the importance of plasticity gating to
maintain a reserve capacity for learning. In Purkinje cells, a candidate gating mechanism of plasticity induction
is inhibition from molecular layer interneurons, which suppresses the evoked calcium response to climbing fiber
excitation that triggers induction of long-term depression (LTD). Therefore, the objective of this study is to test
for a potential synergistic role of inhibitory synapse weakening and compromised LTD in dystrophinopathy and
determine if increasing GABAA receptor responsiveness specifically in Purkinje cells restores a high threshold
for plasticity induction and thus provide a potential therapeutic strategy to ameliorate cerebellar dysfunction. We
will employ a multidisciplinary approach encompassing the use of ex vivo and in vivo functional recordings in
Purkinje-cell-autonomous dystrophin-deficient mice, cell-type specific neuropharmacological perturbations, and
behavioral analyses. Through two aims, we will test correlative and causative links between aberrant neural
circuit responsiveness, spurious plasticity, and cerebellar learning abnormalities. Completion of these aims will
contribute novel insights into plasticity regulation, the etiology of neurological impairment in DMD, and potential
avenues for treating cerebellum-related symptoms of this disorder."
10758955,"Abstract: We have developed ViTrack™, a cuffless, wrist-wearable device that uses a fundamentally new
method to accurately and non-invasively measure BP continuously. ViTrack’s beat-to-beat accurate
measurements, irrespective of patient movement or wrist level to the heart, provide the patient’s circadian BP
pattern, including 24-hr mean BP, nighttime BP, and BP variability (BPV). In addition, ViTrack also measures
heart rate and respiratory parameters and advanced hemodynamics. The hypertensive diseases of pregnancy
(HDP) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The current standard for measuring BP in pregnant
women is the periodic use of oscillometric arm-cuff devices. The oscillometric devices indirectly estimate systolic
(SBP) and diastolic BPs (DBP) based on artery wall oscillations during cuff-deflation. Measurement errors
inherent to this indirect method, patient posture/movement, and wrong cuff size lead to unreliable BP
measurements in 50% of routine office visits. Oscillometric device errors are compounded in pregnant women
due to hemodynamic and vascular changes that reduce oscillations of the arterial wall, resulting in BP
underestimation. In contrast, these hemodynamic changes will have less impact on ViTrack measurements
because it utilizes pressure-dependent spatiotemporal skin displacement to measure SBP and DBP directly. In
addition, random clinic measurements during antenatal visits lead to a 30% wrong diagnosis of HDP due to white
coat or masked hypertension. In addition, there is a need for remote and continuous accurate measurement of
BP for prediction and early deduction of preeclampsia. The 24-hour BP parameters, such as 24-hr mean SBP,
nighttime BP, and BPV, are better predictors of preeclampsia than clinic BP measurements. ViTrack, the first
standalone, wearable, connected device, can provide remote, accurate circadian BP data for correct diagnosis
and enable predictive monitoring for better outcomes.
Our objectives in this Phase II study are: (1) to assess the accuracy of ViTrack SBP and DBP measurements in
pregnant women and as well as in women with severe preeclampsia; (2) to evaluate patient tolerance (i.e.,
comfort) and reliability of ViTrack’s beat-to-beat 24-hr BP measurements, and assess usability; (3) to compare
the 24-hr BP profile in pregnant women with and without HDP; and (4) to compare the number of
hypotensive/hypertensive episodes with ViTrack continuous measurements vs. the current standard of care of
intermittent cuff measurements. The data generated will validate ViTrack as the first standalone wearable
technology for accurate and continuous monitoring of BP during pregnancy."
10788471,"Development of radiation medical countermeasures (MCM) has become a national security priority owing to
such threats as radiological dispersal devices (i.e., “dirty bomb”) and nuclear accidents, which may be caused
by extreme weather (such as occurred in Fukushima, Japan in 2011). Radiation exposure can be potentially
lethal via the hematopoietic-acute radiation syndrome (H-ARS) and the gastrointestinal-ARS (GI-ARS). The
U.S. government has committed to supporting development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) to mitigate
morbidity and mortality of these radiation syndromes. Re-purposed leukemia drugs have proven useful in
treatment of the H-ARS in preclinical models, but there remains no effective MCM for GI-ARS.
Ceramedix, Inc. is developing a pipeline of therapeutic candidates with the goal of preventing and
mitigating illness due to radiation exposure. Our lead candidate, CX-01, is an anti-ceramide single-chain
variable antibody fragment (scFv) that binds ceramide on the exocellular leaflet of the plasma membrane of
radiation-injured endothelial cells in the GI tract and in other organs. By binding ceramide, ceramide-rich
platforms are disrupted, thereby preventing cellular death. Extensive data in multiple species, including non-
human primates (NHPs), show that disrupting the ceramide signaling pathway protects and mitigates the GI-
ARS. We have demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in NHPs as well as mortality benefits in mice. CX-01
may be administered subcutaneously, a critical advantage during mass casualty events.
Ceramedix’ therapeutics may have broad application in multiple additional diseases. Ceramide-rich
platform signaling is a ubiquitous damage response pathway that drives cell injury and death in response to
diverse disease and environmental stimuli. Ceramedix has generated significant preclinical data supporting
treatment of diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema. Ceramedix is also exploring other diseases
including diabetic nephropathy and pulmonary injury (fibrosis and other pulmonary syndromes).
The overall goal of this work is to validate that CX-01 demonstrates equivalent potency and efficacy as a
precursor non-humanized scFv molecule. We will perform in vitro and in vivo pharmacological studies to
support CX-01 IND acceptance.
The ability to prevent and treat GI-ARS would have profound benefits in protecting civilians and defense
personnel. There is no current treatment for GI-ARS, particularly one suitable for field administration following
a mass casualty event. USG has prioritized this critical unmet medical need.
CX-01 represents a major breakthrough in potential treatment of the lethal GI-ARS. CX-01 has the
potential to become the first and only available treatment for GI-ARS. Successful completion of this work will
accelerate IND submission and clinical evaluation of Ceramedix’ transformative therapeutic platform."
10794233,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Cannabis is the most commonly used controlled substance in the US.1,2 Young adults (YA; ages 18-25)
report highest rates of use, and recent epidemiological surveys show an increase in both proportion of YA
using cannabis and frequency of use among those that use.3,4 As frequent and heavy cannabis use is
associated with a variety of short- and long-term unwanted physical and psychosocial outcomes (e.g., altered
brain development, impaired judgement and memory, poor educational outcomes),5–7 there is a need for
approaches to help individuals reduce use and/or use-related harms. One approach to mitigating substance-
related harm is using protective behavioral strategies (PBS). PBS for cannabis consist of strategies an
individual can use before, during, after, or instead of using to reduce use or consequence.8,9 In retrospective
assessments, frequency of PBS use is associated with lower past 30-day cannabis use and consequences
and mediates the relation between various risk factors and cannabis outcomes,8,10–15 highlighting PBS as a
promising means of reducing cannabis use and harms. However, research on PBS-focused interventions is
mixed9,16,17; this mixed support may be due to gaps in the PBS literature. Specifically, the majority of PBS
research has consisted of cross-sectional, between-person retrospective designs, thus we lack understanding
about which strategies work for whom under what circumstances. Emerging PBS research suggests both
between- and within-person (i.e., daily) variability in whether an individual uses any PBS, and if so, which
strategies they use. This suggests a need for a daily measure of cannabis PBS to increase understanding of
how and when individuals utilize PBS and under what circumstances PBS are or are not effective. To address
these gaps, the proposed F31 will take a novel, multimethod approach incorporating scale development work,
a daily data study design, and machine learning methods. Specific Aims include (1) developing and validating
a daily measure of cannabis PBS; and (2) utilizing a daily data design and machine learning techniques to
develop models predicting PBS efficacy (reductions in use/consequences) for each strategy for a given
individual. To complement these aims, the applicant will receive training in (1) etiology, prevention,
intervention, and harm reduction methods for substance use, with a focus on cannabis PBS; (2) psychometric
development and quantitative methods including multilevel modeling and machine learning; (3) daily data study
design and methodology; and (4) research dissemination, including manuscript/grant writing and conference

results can be used to better understand cannabis PBS on a daily level and improve future technology-based
PBS interventions to reduce cannabis-related harms."
10767114,"Project Summary/Abstract
Opioid Use Disorder remains a dire public health problem, but opioid agonists such as fentanyl remain a first-
line therapy for several pain conditions. As in recreational use settings, prolonged use of opioid agonists in pain
management can produce physical dependence and a paradoxical decrease in pain thresholds and tolerance,
which increase patients’ reliance on opioids and increase the likelihood of transitioning to Opioid Use Disorder.
Continual stimulation of the inhibitory µ-opioid receptor (MOR), the primary mediator of the analgesic and
rewarding effects of opioid agonists, induces counter-adaptive excitatory processes and hyperexcitability in
MOR-expressing neurons. To discover new treatments that leverage the benefits of opioids but mitigate aversive
and life-threatening side effects of prolonged opioid use, it is critical to determine the specific cell-types and
neural circuits in the brain that are susceptible to the opioid-induced cellular maladaptations that underlie
dependence and OIH. MORs are densely expressed throughout ascending pain pathways, including in the
parabrachial nucleus of the pons (PBNMOR). PBNMOR neurons project to the capsular region of the central
amygdala (CeC), which itself contains a pronociceptive population of neurons expressing Protein Kinase C-δ
(CeCPKCδ) Activation of the PBNMOR®CeC pathway decreases pain tolerance and increases aversion-related
responses, but its role in driving OIH and withdrawal, and the contribution of CeCPKCδ neurons in particular, has
not been investigated. The goal of the proposal is to determine the impact of fentanyl dependence on the neural
activity in the PBNMOR®CeCPKCδ pathway and whether such activity drives withdrawal and OIH-related behaviors.
Aim 1 will investigate the effects of fentanyl dependence on PBNMOR®CeC projections and their role in driving
OIH and withdrawal behavior by using in vivo population calcium imaging and chemogenetic manipulations
during nociceptive assays and withdrawal. Aim 2 will image and manipulate the CeCPKCδ population during
behavior to determine its contribution to OIH and withdrawal. Successful completion of these Aims will lay the
foundation for future investigations of the pathophysiology of opioid dependence. Ideally, results from this work
will suggest novel therapeutic avenues for reducing dependence mechanisms within specific cell-types. Ms.
Wooldridge will receive expert training in chemogenetics, in vivo calcium imaging and its analysis, viral-mediated
genetic targeting, and rigorous experimental design and statistics. The addition of this training will facilitate the
applicant’s current and future research goals and enable her to have continual impact on basic neuroscience
research throughout a future career as an independent academic researcher."
10932846,"Glioblastomas (GBM) feature a profoundly immunosuppressive myeloid infiltrate that constitutes a formidable
barrier to therapy. The infiltrate’s cellular composition, and the tissue context provided by specialized resident
myeloid cells in the CNS (microglia), distinguish GBM from other malignancies. The principal mediators of
immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME), glioma-associated macrophages/microglia (GAMM),
are exceedingly difficult therapy targets. Their entrenched immune subversive traits, phenotypic heterogeneity
and plasticity pose obstacles to targeted GAMM re-polarization. The goal of this project is to decipher the
mechanisms of GBM immunotherapy with recombinant poliovirus, PVSRIPO, a neurotropic +strand RNA virus
with a deep pro-inflammatory imprint. Poliovirus naturally targets the mononuclear phagocytic system—
macrophages, microglia, dendritic cells (DC)—due to constitutive expression of its receptor CD155 in this
compartment. Wild type poliovirus infection is lytic in DCs/macrophages. In contrast, PVSRIPO, engineered for
attenuation by internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) exchange with human rhinovirus type 2, has a peculiar non-
cytopathogenic host relationship defined by accentuated innate antiviral signaling.
 Infection of the glioma TME with PVSRIPO unleashes multilayered proinflammatory events, including
lingering +strand RNA virus replication within GAMM, activation of diverse innate signaling cascades via multiple
double-stranded RNA sensors, profuse type-I interferon dominant inflammation, polio-specific CD4+T cell
immunologic recall in the tumor, and widespread microglia activation and proliferation in the normal brain.
PVSRIPO has shown promise with single intratumor administration in recurrent GBM, yielding durable
radiographic responses associated with long-term survival in a subset of patients. We uncovered that patients
whose tumors had relatively lower mutational burden and who experienced a short time to 1st recurrence survived
longer after PVSRIPO. These features were associated with enhanced TME inflammatory signatures, indicating
that tumor-intrinsic conditions for GAMM engagement influence immunotherapy outcomes.
 Our central premise is that PVSRIPO generates glioma immune surveillance via proinflammatory
activation of GAMM resulting in stimulation of local tumor antigen cross-presentation, T cell infiltration
of brain parenchyma, and enhanced CD8+T cell effector functions. Realizing this potential in the clinic
for all patients depends on resolving mechanisms that govern antitumor CD8+T cell immunity in the
brain. To achieve this objective, we propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Determine the mechanisms of
microglia/GAMM proinflammatory activation induced by recombinant poliovirus; (2) Elucidate the impact of
microglia cross-presentation on PVSRIPO immunotherapy; (3) Determine if repeat dosing or CD40 ligation
improve the antitumor efficacy of PVSRIPO."

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis, has infected about one-quarter of the
global population and kills over 1 million people every year. Mtb is an exceptionally successful human pathogen
largely because the bacteria can adapt to withstand several different stresses in vivo and can enter a state of
replicative quiescence where Mtb can persist for months to years. This presents major challenges to treating
tuberculosis as many anti-tubercular drugs target bacterial replication and cell wall synthesis. Mtb have a unique
mechanism of division where the bacteria grow asymmetrically and produce daughter cells that vary in size,
growth rate, and cell wall composition. This contrasts with cell division processes employed by other well-studied
bacteria, and Mtb possess distinct cellular machinery and regulatory pathways to coordinate their cell division.
Thus, it is critical to understand Mtb’s unique mechanism of replication, how it is regulated, and how it contributes
to bacterial pathogenesis. The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate two novel regulatory networks that
control Mtb cell division, and to understand the role this regulation plays during tuberculosis infection when Mtb
slow or halt their growth. I hypothesize that the uncharacterized transcription factors WhiA and WhiB2 are
essential regulators of cell division in Mtb, and that both proteins are required for maintaining bacterial viability
in vivo, even during persistent tuberculosis infection when the bacteria enter a slow or non-replicative state. This
proposal seeks to i) utilize novel CRISPR interference technology in Mtb to interrogate the function of two
essential and previously uncharacterized genes, ii) define two regulons that are critical for regulating cell division
in Mtb, and iii) determine the importance of these regulatory networks during persistent tuberculosis infection.
These aims employ phenotypically relevant models of Mtb infection, including macrophage and mouse models
of disease. Successful completion of this proposal will advance the field by elucidating how Mtb regulate cell
division and provide insight into how these regulatory pathways contribute to Mtb’s persistence and survival in
vivo. Understanding mechanisms of Mtb replication and persistence can aid with improving and developing
therapeutics for treating tuberculosis."

Endometriosis, the presence of endometrial tissue at an extra-uterine site, is a common yet enigmatic
gynecologic disease that dampens the quality of life for approximately 10-15% of reproductive-aged women.
Although endometriosis is regarded as a benign condition, many women with this disease experience chronic
episodes of debilitating pain, dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, and/or infertility. Numerous theories have attempted
to explain disease pathogenesis including retrograde menstruation, a genetic predisposition, and altered
differentiation of non-uterine cells. Unfortunately, theories to date have failed to explain all incidences of disease
occurrence. Thus, I am exploring the possibility that endometriosis is an adult-onset disease that emerges due
to an early life disruption of endocrine-immune cross-communication. I hypothesize that an in utero toxicant
exposure trains bone marrow-derived immune progenitor cells (BMDCs) and subsequently promotes the
development of endometriosis in adulthood. Immune cell training refers to the development of memory of a
previous infection, but it is unknown whether immune cells similarly “remember” a past toxicant exposure.
Nevertheless, our laboratory has shown that in utero TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) exposure in
mice results in a loss of uterine progesterone (P4) sensitivity and hyperinflammation as seen in women with
endometriosis. Herein, I will utilize our established mouse model of toxicant exposure to determine if in
utero TCDD exposure induces immune cell training prompting the development of the endometriosis-like uterine
phenotype in adult mice. In Specific Aim 1, I will examine the relationship between toxicant-mediated peritoneal
inflammation and reproductive dysfunction by characterizing the intraperitoneal immune phenotype and uterine
phenotype of TCDD-exposed mice compared to wild-type C57/BL6 (WT) mice. Furthermore, I will determine if
TCDD-mediated alterations of immune cells directly contribute to uterine dysfunction by adoptively
transferring BMDCs from TCDD-exposed mice to control recipient mice. In Specific Aim 2, I will elucidate the
molecular mechanisms underlying the TCDD-generated phenotype by examining the epigenetic, metabolic, and
functional status of TCDD-exposed immune cells in comparison to unexposed immune cells. Overall,
determining the specific contribution of immune cells to reduced P4 sensitivity within the uterus and identifying
targetable pathways will determine the potential utility of immune cells as a diagnostic and/or therapeutic
target. This proposal builds upon preliminary data that I have obtained and will provide me with the training I
seek in reproductive toxicology, reproductive immunology, immunotoxicology, and immunometabolism. Aside
from gaining this knowledge and technical skills, I will also gain necessary experience in data analysis,
generation of manuscripts, communication of my results to scientific and lay audiences, and the formulation of
testable hypotheses. At the conclusion of this fellowship, I will be well-positioned to undertake postdoctoral
training in a leading laboratory and pursue my goal to be an independent investigator."

Plasmodium infections and the disease malaria remain global health emergencies. Plasmodium parasites
replicate within and cause the destruction of host red blood cells, which triggers inflammation and causes the
symptoms of malarial disease. Parasite-specific antibody responses that develop following infection are critical
for controlling parasite burden and limiting disease severity. CD4+ helper T cells are essential for coordinating
these protective antibody responses. However, sterilizing anti-Plasmodium immunity rarely develops, even
following repeated infection. We hypothesize this is due to deficient Plasmodium-specific effector and memory
CD4+ T cell development and function. One of the most critical challenges to developing new immune-based
therapies or vaccines against Plasmodium is understanding the mechanisms by which long-lived Plasmodium-
specific memory CD4+ T cells develop, function and persist following infection.
 In the continuation of this project, we apply powerful new cellular and molecular genetic approaches that
enable direct, high-resolution analyses of Plasmodium-specific memory CD4+ T cells. These new approaches
facilitate our long-term goal to understand the mechanisms governing the development and function of
Plasmodium-specific memory CD4+ T cell responses. Our goal is addressed by three specific aims that have
evolved to test: 1) how hemozoin, a parasite-derived product of hemoglobin degradation, influences the induction
and maintenance of Plasmodium-specific memory CD4+ T cell populations; 2) how constraints on host cellular
metabolism shape memory CD4+ T cell formation and function; and 3) how specific epigenetic regulators govern
the differentiation and function of CD4+ memory T cells. Our innovative conceptual and technical advances and
mechanistic approaches enable us to establish additional new paradigms for understanding and enhancing
CD4+ T cell-dependent anti-Plasmodium immunity. Understanding immune memory formation following
Plasmodium infection will enable us to identify and develop new immune-based strategies to limit Plasmodium
pathogenesis and disease burden."
10756937,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Individuals who suffer from a diminished or lost sense of smell (Hyposmia/Anosmia) consistently report food to
be bland and less palatable, resulting in a reduction in diet quality and quality of life. Despite these reports, we
have limited knowledge about how smell loss influences food perception and preferences from experimental
studies. As a result, there is minimal dietary guidance for H/A individuals. H/A individuals self-report preferring
saltier foods and increasing their salt intake to compensate for the loss of smell-mediated food flavors.
However, salt consumption already exceeds recommended levels in 90% of the population and contributes to
cardiovascular disease; further increasing sodium intake can have broad, negative health implications.
Documenting salt preferences and intake using validated measures will help guide future research on
improving food liking and diet quality in H/A individuals. This proposal will (1) assess differences in salt taste
preferences, salt intake, and appetite between H/A individuals and those with a normal sense of smell
(normosmic) and (2) determine the acute effects of capsaicin on flavor, liking, and salt taste intensity in H/A
compared with normosmic individuals. Aim 1 will measure (a) salt taste intensity using general Labeled
Magnitude Scales, (b) liking using Labeled Hedonic Scales, (c) salt taste preferences using the Monell Forced-
Choice Paired Comparison Tracking Procedure, (d) sodium intake via 24-hour urine samples, and (e) appetite
using the Power of Food Scale in H/A individuals with long-term smell loss (>12 weeks) compared with
normosmic individuals. These data will help guide future strategies to improve diet quality in H/A individuals.
Aim 2 will test whether capsaicin can boost salt taste intensity in this population, thus establishing a sensory
strategy to avoid excess salt for flavor by using the same scales to measure salt intensity, overall flavor, and
liking. This will provide a sensory strategy to reduce salt intake and improve diet quality specifically for H/A
individuals, filling this critical information gap. This research aims to understand food preferences and
perception related to smell loss and reduce salt intake, which has implications for diet quality and risk for
cardiovascular disease, which aligns with priority areas 2 and 4 for the NIDCD. The concurrent training plan in
psychophysics and sensory measurement will complement my training in nutrition science to support my long-
term research goal of identifying sensory strategies to improve diet quality and reduce the risk for chronic
diseases."

Although sleep apnea arising from sleep-disordered breathing commonly occurs during pregnancy, the
cumulative impact of brief repetitive episodes of maternal intermittent hypoxia (IHx) on fetal brain development
is unknown. We have developed a novel clinically relevant model of maternal IHx, which reproducibly results in
fetal systemic IHx early in the third trimester. The fetal hippocampus appears to be particularly sensitive to
maternal IHx, which chronically disrupts neuronal activity and cellular mechanisms of learning and memory. Our
over-riding hypothesis is that maternal IHx globally disrupts fetal cerebral development and results in persistent
changes in postnatal learning and memory. In aim 1, we will first employ near infrared spectroscopy to define
cerebral tissue hypoxemia in awake fetuses subjected to maternal IHx in utero. We will next determine the
susceptibility of the fetal hippocampus to cell death, inflammation and white matter injury. We will also determine
the impact of maternal IHx on disturbances in maturation of neuronal dendrites and spine density, which shape
behaviorally important neural circuits, which regulate synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission during
development. Complementary electrophysiological studies will determine the functional effects of IHx on synaptic
transmission, long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) and intrinsic excitability of hippocampal neurons to fire action
potentials; which are all key cellular mechanisms that mediate learning and memory in vivo. Aim 2 will employ
complementary advanced MRI and morphometric approaches to analyze the relative susceptibility of
hippocampal-related brain regions to fetal IHx, which could inform future clinical studies by defining the global
impact of maternal IHx on key brain regions required for optimal neurodevelopment and circuit formation. We
will determine the spectrum of regional disturbances in fetal brain growth and maturation, cell death, inflammation
and myelination and provide a quantitative analysis of differences in fetal brain volume differences. In aim 3,
mechanistic fetal hippocampal studies will test the hypothesis that enhancing hippocampal synaptic transmission
at CA3-CA1 synapses will reverse maternal IHx-mediated disturbances in fetal hippocampal synaptic plasticity,
which underlie the developmental maturation of cellular mechanisms of learning and memory. We will determine
in 3.1 the contribution of disturbances in AMPA and NMDA receptor subunit composition and expression levels
to disturbances in glutamatergic synaptic transmission and LTP. In 3.2, we will determine the efficacy of an
allosteric AMPA receptor agonist (ampakine) to strengthen synaptic transmission and plasticity in vitro. In 3.3,
We will undertake pioneering neurobehavioral studies to determine if disrupted fetal hippocampal synaptic
plasticity results in persistent hippocampal learning and memory deficits in juvenile lambs. Our long-term
objectives are to define mechanisms through which maternal IHx disrupts fetal cerebral maturation and develop
strategies to mitigate pregnancy-associated complications of maternal IHx on brain development, which may
improve learning and memory."
10848224,"Approximately one third of older adults in senior communities fall each year, and falls are the leading cause of
morbidity and mortality in this age group. Falls are associated with poor quality of life, disability, and death; the
medical cost is over $30 billion annually. Despite these statistics, fall reduction strategies have had limited
impact for frail seniors. The most devastating fall-related outcome is a hip or other fracture. Over 90% of hip
and nonvertebral fractures occur from a fall, and approximately 85% of long-term care (LTC) residents have
osteoporosis. Recently, investigators have reported cross-talk between muscle and bone through mechanical
and biochemical pathways. Osteosarcopenia, a newly described geriatric syndrome, involves the coexistence
of osteoporosis (low bone mass) and sarcopenia (low muscle mass/function). The coexistence of these
conditions puts patients at even greater risk for fall/fracture-related serious adverse outcomes. Denosumab
(DEMAB), a medication approved for osteoporosis, acts on molecular targets shared between muscle and
bone. In the DEMAB pivotal trial and a meta-analysis in healthy adults, investigators reported a reduction in
recalled falls in addition to a decrease in fractures. Therefore, DEMAB has the potential to reduce both falls
and fractures in a vulnerable population at high risk for both events. Our goal is to demonstrate efficacy of
the novel agent DEMAB to improve or preserve muscle health, strength, mobility and function in frail older
adults. If successful, this would lay the groundwork for a larger multicenter trial to examine the dual-action for
fall and fracture prevention. To bridge this knowledge gap we propose to conduct a 1-year, randomized,
double-blind, active-controlled trial to test the efficacy of DEMAB (expected active muscle agent) versus
zoledronic acid (ZOL, muscle control) in 248 underserved, LTC, frail institutionalized men and women (age≥65)
with osteoporosis. Muscle strength, power, quality, markers, function and bone measures will be collected in a
mobile lab. At trial completion, all participants receive ZOL for osteoporosis therapy and to prevent potential
bone loss following DEMAB discontinuation. Our objectives include Aim 1: Evaluate efficacy of DEMAB to
preserve/improve muscle strength, power, mass and structure. Aim 2: Examine the mechanistic
biochemical components of the muscle-bone connection. Aim 3: Explore if the DEMAB effect extends
to distal functional outcomes. This study includes a number of innovative features: 1) focus on the
neglected LTC population of frail older men and women in whom we have a track record of successful
enrollment, 2) inclusion of an approved osteoporosis agent feasible in the LTC setting with a novel focus on
muscle strength, power, structure, and function, 3) mobile lab allowing onsite participation, 4) assessment
of muscle and bone parameters by portable techniques, and 5) electronic alerts for falls and SAEs. This study
will challenge the current paradigm of avoiding anti-fracture/fall therapy in vulnerable fallers and establish the
necessary conditions to justify a large trial to maintain muscle and bone health to reduce falls and fractures."

 Mid-substance Achilles tendinopathy is a painful, debilitating, and chronic tendon pathology. Rehabilitation
exercises are the first treatment option for patients, but clinical studies have reported 20-60% of patients
continue to experience pain and symptoms 5-years later. Even when patients experience symptom relief, only
one-quarter of these patients fully recover muscle-tendon function. Current clinical guidelines recommend
patients perform heel-rise exercises to eccentrically load the pathologic tendon and promote healing. However,
Achilles tendon loading during daily-living often exceeds these structured rehabilitation loads, and the
biomechanical properties of pathologic tendon varies amongst patients. Identifying patient subgroups based on
similarities in tendon loading and biomechanics is a critical next step towards improving patient outcomes and
tendon healing. Our long-term goal is to develop personalized rehabilitation protocols that maximize tendon
recovery following acute and chronic Achilles tendon injuries. The overall objective of this study is to determine
similarities in tendon loading and biomechanics in patients with mid-substance Achilles tendinopathy and how
these similarities affect tendon healing, pain, and functional outcomes. This study leverages innovative
techniques to 1) continuously monitor Achilles tendon loading during rehabilitation and daily-living and 2)
quantify tendon status using ultrasound stress-imaging. Aim 1 will identify groups of patients with Achilles
tendinopathy based on loading patterns and stress-imaging profiles. Aim 2 will determine if tendon healing and
outcomes change over time. Aim 3 will explore the impact of sex on tendon healing and outcomes. This study
will be the first to identify Achilles tendon loading profiles that are associated with tendon healing and
outcomes based on patient-specific factors including tendon biomechanical properties and sex. By measuring
circulating levels of sex hormones, this study will determine if specific levels of estrogen and progesterone –
which can be modified using hormonal contraceptive pills – impact tendon health. Finally, with the recent shift
towards telemedicine, this study will remotely monitor Achilles tendon loading, which has the potential to
expand clinical care beyond patient visits to the clinic."

 Relapse is the major cause of cancer related mortality in children with leukemia. Despite improvements
in overall survival for children with B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), for the 600 patients
who will relapse each year, half will die of their disease. The high mortality of patients who relapse underscores
the need for improved risk prediction and treatment strategies to prevent recurrent leukemia. Current
approaches to relapse prediction are limited by insufficient accuracy, delayed prediction and the inability to
make actionable treatment adjustments based on prediction information. To address these limitations, we
applied a single-cell, high-parameter proteomic approach to ALL patient samples at the time of diagnosis,
accurately predicting future relapse based on the presence of pre-B cells with activated signaling. This
approach was 38% more accurate than standard of care relapse prediction methods. We propose that
identifying relapse-predictive cells in ALL at the time of diagnosis using their distinguishing proteomic
and genetic features will result in a clinical risk prediction model that is accurate, immediate, and
actionable. This approach to relapse prediction will change the clinical paradigm of relapse risk in ALL to
reduce the incidence of relapse itself.
 Using large multi-institutional, multimodal cohorts of molecularly and clinically annotated diagnostic
patient samples, we will apply deep proteomic approaches to identify surface proteins uniquely expressed on
relapse predictive pre-B cells enabling direct identification in a diagnosis sample. We will determine how
genomic mutations associate with the presence of relapse predictive cells and examine their genomic
mutational burden using single-cell exome sequencing. Finally, building on our data-driven, machine learning
approaches, we will construct a diagnostic relapse predictor that is more accurate than standard of care
models while informing on leukemia biology and targeted therapeutic options for patients at risk. This will
enable a more precise approach to patient classification and treatment, reducing the number of children facing
relapse and moving closer to precision medicine for children with ALL."
10828380,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Reward-guided decision-making and impulse control are disrupted after chronic cocaine use. These changes
have been attributed to altered functions in brain circuits critical for computation of reward predictions, action
policies, prediction errors and attention. ‘Reward prediction’ signals reflect the reward the animal expects to
receive as a result of behavior or presentation of a stimulus. ‘Action policies’ are rules that govern behavior that
are triggered by external stimuli or context, and are thought to underlie habits. Both reward predictions and action
policies are modified when there are violations in predictions known as ‘reward prediction errors’. ‘Signed’ reward
prediction errors reflect the valence associated with an error, strengthening or weakening the associability
between cues, responses and outcomes. ‘Unsigned’ prediction errors reflect the surprise induced by errors which
lead to increases in ‘attention’ so that learning can occur. We have uncovered neural correlates of these
constructs and the relationship between them by recording from multiple brain areas as rats perform a reward-
guided decision-making task in which we unexpectedly varied the delay to and size of reward across several
trial blocks. We have shown that nucleus accumbens core (NAc) and anterior insula (AI) encode reward
predictions, firing strongly for cues that predict more valued reward, whereas firing in dorsal lateral striatum (DLS)
is highly associative, encoding action policies such as stimulus-response associations and contextual bias
signals. We have also shown that midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons increase firing to unexpected reward and
decrease firing to unexpected reward omission. During learning these signed prediction errors transfer to cues,
with cues predicting more valued reward eliciting stronger firing. Unlike firing of DA neurons in ventral tegmental
area (VTA), our work has shown that firing in basolateral amygdala (ABL) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)
better reflects integrated unsigned prediction error signals and attention, increasing during unexpected up- and
down-shifts in value at the time of the error and during cue sampling on subsequent trials.
 Here, we propose that activation of ACC increases attention and engages model-based mechanisms that
govern goal-directed behavior and associated mechanisms in AI, NAc and VTA, and that chronic cocaine
reduces the fidelity of reward prediction and prediction error signals, in part, by disrupting ACC function. Further,
we propose that epigenetic changes in ACC, NAc and DLS after chronic drug use alter cue selectivity in a way
that promotes fast, automatic behavior by altering the start point and rate of signals that drive actions. In this
resubmission of my renewal application we propose to further model the normal circuit and behavior, and its
disruption after cocaine-exposure by bi-directionally manipulating neural signals via optogenetics and epigenetic
(histone deacetylase 5, HDAC5) manipulation. By performing these experiments, we will gain further insight into
how the brain functions normally, how it is disrupted after chronic cocaine use, and determine if repairing neural
signals in ACC and striatum might restore behavior and neural constructs in downstream regions."

Central venous catheters are an indispensable tool in modern clinical practice to provide venous access for
hemodialysis, chemotherapy, parenteral nutrition, and repeated blood sampling. However, they carry a high risk
of infection and thrombosis, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and length of hospital stay. The frequent
use of antibiotics and anticoagulants to prevent and treat these complications causes bacterial resistance and
adverse side effects such as bleeding. Therefore, there is a pressing need for novel strategies to reduce
infectious and thrombotic complications associated with central venous catheters. This project aims to combat
these complications using catheter lock solutions that release nitric oxide (NO), a natural drug exerting both
bactericidal and antithrombogenic activities without engendering drug resistance and side effects. The lock
solution contains S-nitrosoglutathione as a natural and non-toxic NO donor. Precisely controlled release of NO
is achieved by our innovative formulations based on the formation of host-guest inclusion complexes with the
zwitterionic form of S-nitrosoglutathione and the creation of suspensions of S-nitrosoglutathione nanocrystals.
The duration of NO release is tunable from 1 day to over 1 month to meet the requirements of locking regimens
in different catheter applications. The flux of NO is controlled within the safe and effective range to inhibit bacteria
and thrombus growth without causing toxicity to tissue and blood. Due to the high diffusivity of NO through the
polymer walls of intravascular catheters, it is not only generated in the intraluminal space and distal catheter
opening, but also released from the exterior surface of the catheter and the hub. Compared to other lock solutions
using traditional antimicrobials or anticoagulants, the NO release solution is unique due to its full protection over
the entire catheter from both bacterial colonization and thrombus formation.
In Aim 1, we will design various S-nitrosoglutathione formulations to provide short-term, medium-term, and long-
term NO release from commercial central venous catheters made of silicone rubber or polyurethane. In Aim 2,
the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the NO release lock solution against planktonic and biofilm bacteria will be
tested using five prevalent bloodborne microbes including a multidrug-resistant strain. Potential lytic activity to
erythrocytes and toxicity to endothelial cells will be evaluated in vitro. In Aim 3, the antithrombotic efficacy of
short-term and medium-term NO release lock solutions will be assessed in 7-day pig experiments. The locking
protocols will simulate the locking frequencies in hemodialysis and chemotherapy. In Aim 4, a 4-week chronic
pig model will be used to compare solutions with 3 days, 1 week, and 4 weeks of NO release with taurolidine-
citrate-heparin lock solutions with regard to both infection and thrombosis. Success of this project would lead to
a new generation of inexpensive lock solutions that will dramatically reduce infectious and thrombotic risks of
central venous catheters."

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common in children with an estimated prevalence of 1-6%. Untreated
pediatric OSA is associated with hypertension, autonomic dysfunction, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder,
neurocognitive deficits, and poor quality of life. Adenotonsillar hypertrophy is the primary risk factor for pediatric
OSA, and adenotonsillectomy (AT) is the recommended first-line treatment. However, it is unclear whether
children with small tonsils will benefit from AT. Clinic assessments of tonsil size do not consistently correlate
with OSA severity or response to AT, resulting in confusion about how best to treat OSA in children with small
tonsils. Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) enables direct observation of the sites and patterns of
obstruction during sedated sleep. DISE increasingly helps guide surgical decision-making in adult OSA, and
can also be used to guide surgical decisions in pediatric OSA and improve outcomes. The overall objective of
this study is to test the effectiveness of a novel personalized approach to the surgical treatment of OSA in
children. It is our central hypothesis that a personalized DISE-directed surgical approach in children
with small tonsils will be superior to the standard first line treatment of AT. To test this hypothesis, we
propose an unprecedented randomized controlled trial of DISE-directed surgery vs AT in children ages 2-18
years with clinically small tonsils with the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Compare the physiological outcomes of DISE-directed surgery vs AT in children with small tonsils.
Hypothesis 1: DISE-directed surgery will result in a clinically significantly greater improvement in the
obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) compared to the standard AT intervention.
Aim 2: Compare the clinical outcomes of DISE-directed surgery vs AT in children with small tonsils.
Hypothesis 2: DISE-directed surgery will result in a clinically significantly greater improvement in disease-
specific QOL (OSA18) compared to the standard AT intervention.
Aim 3: Determine if OSA severity is associated with specific anatomic endotypes in children with small tonsils.
Hypothesis 3: Baseline OSA severity (defined by OAHI) is correlated with increasing severity of obstruction
(i.e., number of anatomic sites with complete obstruction on DISE rating scale).
Aim 4: Identify potential associations between baseline patient characteristics (e.g. age, obesity) and specific
anatomic endotypes (e.g., severe nasal obstruction, severe base of tongue obstruction) in children with
clinically small tonsils (exploratory aim).
This comparative effectiveness trial will be the first to directly compare a personalized surgical
approach to the standard treatment in children where the outcome of AT is uncertain. This novel
approach may improve OSA outcomes and reduce the burden of unnecessary AT or secondary surgery for
persistent OSA after an ineffective AT."
10756455,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical intervention used to treat the cardinal motor symptoms of
Parkinson’s disease (PD) when medical interventions fail. While DBS for the motor symptoms of PD has been
used for decades, there are still gaps in our knowledge on the underlying mechanism of action, which, if
resolved, might enhance DBS outcomes further. One point of improvement in DBS can be found in the process
of DBS lead placement. DBS lead placement is a challenging, time-intensive procedure based on radiographic
criteria, then refined by confirming motor symptom reduction and assessing side effects intraoperatively in
awake patients. DBS lead placement may be improved using evoked potentials (EPs) as objective, surrogate
biomarkers linked to neural activity and appropriate symptom relief. EPs have potential to guide appropriate
placement of DBS leads more rapidly and accurately, possibly even in patients under anesthesia, particularly
in subthalamic nucleus (STN) implants. The use of EPs as a biomarker may reduce surgical time, improve
patient outcomes, and improve patient comfort. The goal of this proposal is to characterize the effect of
stimulation amplitude, lead location, and anesthesia on local and distant EPs to identify more reliable and
efficient methods of lead placement. This will be particularly impactful if EPs correlate with symptom relief,
removing the need for behavioral characterization and expediting awake and/or asleep DBS lead placement.
 The first aim is to quantify the effect of DBS amplitude and location on local and distant EPs during
awake DBS lead placement. Experiments will occur in concert with partnering neurosurgeons and neurologists.
Local and distant EPs will be recorded simultaneously during DBS at the target of the dorsal STN and off-
target at the ventral STN. DBS stimulation trials will include sub-therapeutic, therapeutic, and supra-therapeutic
intensities. Before and during the DBS trials, I will concurrently quantify bradykinesia and tremor. Next, I will
repeat DBS trials in follow-up clinic one month later to determine the predictive value of intraoperative EP
recordings on post-op symptom treatment. The second aim will repeat these steps in patients undergoing
asleep surgery. These studies are expected to quantitatively establish the causal relationship between DBS
and EPs, and the correlative link between EPs and behavior critical for the use of EPs in the clinical setting.
 This proposal will ultimately support my training as a dual-degree MD/PhD student, in preparation for a
career as an independent physician-scientist at the intersection of the bench and the bedside. The training plan
will include attending conferences, gaining further clinical experience, and further developing my scientific
reasoning skills. The training environment is well-equipped to prepare me for my future career as a physician-
scientist. My primary sponsor (PI) has a long record of mentoring trainees and is an expert in the field of DBS,
and the lab has a long record of successful collaboration with partnering physicians, several of which will also
provide direct mentoring support, to help guide my long-term clinical career."

 I believe that combining disease gene discovery approaches with in-depth follow-up mechanistic and
functional studies is a unique aspect of my research program. Our recent discovery of “human-specific” pathways
and phenotypes (compared to mice) in midbrain DA neurons has led us to focus on patient-derived DA neurons
to examine the function of PD-linked genes. By employing co-cultures of iPS-derived neurons, microglia and
astrocytes, we will examine the interplay of cell-autonomous and no-cell autonomous pathways that lead to
dysfunction of midbrain DA neurons in PD. Moreover, we will use innovative technology to simultaneously
examine a large number of genetic variants in a pooled iPS approach that has not been possible previously.
Finally, our recent discovery of direct contacts between lysosomes and mitochondrial has opened a completely
new opportunity to examine inter- and intra-organellar dynamics in neurodegeneration. The R35 award would
provide me the time, freedom and stability to be even more adventurous and, as always, follow the most
interesting biology to have a high impact on the field."
10830302,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Metastasis in distant organs years after treatment is the primary cause of cancer death. Late
progression occurs through the reactivation of dormant tumor cells that disseminated early in the disease. To
date, no therapy has been designed to target those cells and the lack of understanding on their biology prevents
the development of selective strategies to kill them. We aim to gain molecular insight into the gene regulatory
signature of the cancer dormancy state and use this information to devise a dormant cancer cell biosensor that
will allow us to identify, profile, and genetically manipulate them in vivo.
Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the application of intersectional genetics tools to define the unique
transcriptional profile of dormant cells will reveal vulnerabilities that could be exploited to eliminate those cells.
Specific Aims: Aim 1. To obtain and validate the enhancer activity profiles of dormant cancer cells in an in vivo
context Aim 2. To develop a dormant cancer cell biosensor and test its in vivo potential to selectively identify
dormant cancer cells.
Study design/Methods: To increase the specificity of dormant cancer cell identification in vivo, reduce side-
effects on non-target normal cells, and allow the systematization of the generation of dormant cell-specific
biosensors and its downstream applications, such as targeted cell ablation therapies, we propose to develop a
new dormant cell biosensor that bypasses cell-surface marker requirements distinguishing them instead via
intracellular properties that can be harnessed to allow the precise and exclusive genetic manipulation of these
cells within the body. We will validate our biosensor in vivo by using cellular dormancy models and intravital two-
photon microscopy.
Relevance: The mechanisms of cancer cell dormancy are poorly understood, hence the options available for
their targeted treatment to prevent metastasis are limited. Here, we propose to use state-of-the-art genomic
activity profiling technology to gain molecular insight into the genetic program that defines the cancer dormancy
state in vivo. We will then couple our unique computational and synthetic biology know-how to define unique
signatures of the dormancy program to engineer genetic sensors that can be systemically-delivered into the body
to find dormant cancer cells. With this strategy, we hope to develop strategies to eliminate metastatic dormant
cells, the source of metastasis."

Inflammation is a powerful, multifactorial host defense mechanism intended to protect the body from microbial
insult and tissue damage. As such, inflammation is not only essential to the maintenance of homeostasis but is
on its own deleterious when regulatory mechanisms go awry. Aberrant immune activation is prominent in
human diseases and can contribute to the development of inflammatory (e.g. sepsis), autoimmune, and
allergic conditions for which there are limited therapeutic options available that address the underlying immune
dysfunction. The overarching goal of my research program is to elucidate fundamental and functional
relationships between nanoparticle designs and biological responses in the context of inflammatory
conditions. Indeed, nanoparticles can be designed with inherent immunomodulatory properties that can limit
the extent of the inflammatory response through non-specific or antigen-specific mechanisms. Our group has
made significant strides in both of these areas where we have shown that our custom-designed nanoparticles
could blunt non-specific proinflammatory responses induced by multiple Toll-like receptor agonists in the
absence of additional therapeutic agents. It was further demonstrated that these cargo-less nanoparticles
improved survival in lethal mouse models of LPS-induced endotoxemia to 70%. Encapsulation of peptide or
protein antigens into tolerogenic nanoparticles (tNPs) allows for the specific delivery of antigens to innate
immune cells. Through manipulation of innate immune cell antigen presentation to T cells, the activation of
antigen-specific T cells and disease progression was halted. tNPs were recently evaluated in a Phase I and II
clinical trial for the treatment of celiac disease with success. The rapid progression of nanoparticles
towards clinical implementation highlights the urgent need for mechanistic studies to elucidate the
underlying principles that govern nanoparticle-based immunomodulation. We aim to address this need
by capitalizing on our expertise in nanoparticle design and immune engineering, which includes polymer
synthesis, nanoparticle formulation, and immunology. Over the next five years, we will specifically focus on
how the physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles affect multiple outcomes associated with
inflammatory responses using clinically-relevant in vitro and in vivo models of sepsis, autoimmunity, and
allergy. The outcomes of these studies will enable us to establish a set of design rules that govern the
immunomodulatory activity and interactions of nanoparticles and the immune system to guide the development
and clinical translation of novel nanoparticles for inflammation and antigen-specific disease intervention.
Through successful realization of our program, we will not only contribute to our understanding of the
properties that are necessary for nanoparticles to interact with and internalize into immune cells but also
develop a set of design rules that govern nanoparticle-based immunomodulation, which will have immediate
therapeutic value suitable for future translational applications."

Yearly influenza epidemics strike millions of people, resulting in up to 500,000 deaths. Fatalities caused by most
seasonal influenza viruses is <0.03%, with significant mortality in the young and elderly populations. Presently,
influenza treatment is only partially effective, and some influenza strains are resistant to the currently marketed
therapeutics, adamantanes and the neuraminidase inhibitor Tamiflu®), and even the recently approved cap-
dependent endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil (Xofluza®). Zanamivir (ZAN, Relenza®), remains highly
active against oseltamivir-resistant influenza strains, however, its therapeutic impact is severely limited by its
route of administration, oral inhalation, which renders it unsuitable for patients with compromised respiratory
systems. Therefore, the development of a novel delivery alternative for ZAN will address a significant unmet
medical need. Transdermal drug delivery offers several improvements over other delivery systems. The drug
directly enters the systemic circulation, avoiding syringe needles, and could allow large numbers of patients to
be reached during an influenza pandemic outbreak. ZAN itself cannot cross the human skin barrier at therapeutic
rates, however, microarray-enabled transdermal delivery is an elegant, efficient, and painless method for
increasing the skin permeation of many drugs, including ZAN. Our novel drug-device combination product, TSR-
066, consists of a swellable microarray patch (MAP), which continuously delivers ZAN over 5 days. This delivery
approach for ZAN will expand its reach into patient groups for which Relenza® is contraindicated.
Based on the well-established preclinical and clinical safety of ZAN, TSRL has achieved an agreement with the
FDA that TSR-066 can be developed using a 505(b)2 regulatory strategy. Upon collection of sufficient data to
support the change in the route of administration under our ongoing SBIR grants, TSRL plans to submit an
investigational new application (IND) in 2024. This Fast-Track SBIR will allow for the planning and conduct of a
Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerance of TSR-066 in healthy subjects. During
the Phase I portion of the grant, we will assemeble the clinical development team, develop the clinical protocol,
investigator brochure, consent form, case report form, budget, and manual of operations. These documents will
be prepared through collaboration with BIA Clinical Group, LLC and reviewed by our scientific collaborators, the
clinical research unit utilized for the study, and participating Clinical Research Organizations. The Phase II
portion of the grant will be the actual conduct of the trial. We have formed a collaborative network of researchers
and drug development specialists that will allow us to successfully complete the proposed research plan."

 The Computation Component of the Gene Expression Database (GXD) project supports GXD by
maintaining and extending its sophisticated informatics infrastructure. GXD is a rich resource of mouse
developmental gene expression data through which researchers can discover expression patterns crucial for
understanding the function of genes and the molecular mechanisms that underlie human development, health,

the robustness of GXD’s information infrastructure through regular maintenance; improving performance by
upgrading our indexing technology stack and parallelizing index distribution; upgrading our curation interface to
a modern web-based platform; refining/retraining our relevance classifier to be more sensitive to scRNA-seq

Schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are common and debilitating
neurodevelopmental disorders that together affect more than 5 million Americans. Despite more than fifty years
of research, no cures exist and the standard of treatment remains unsatisfactory. Dysregulation of alternative
splicing in the human brain has been implicated in SZ. Among genes with critical brain functions, many have a
large number of exons, resulting in complex splicing patterns that can vary between neuronal subtypes;
however, the isoform repertoires of most of these complex genes have not been resolved in a cell-type specific
manner. Recent advances in long read sequencing have provided an unprecedented opportunity to resolve
complex alternative splicing. Thus, to better understand the clinical impact of changes of alternative splicing in
psychiatric diseases, it is critical to evaluate how isoform repertoire impact neuronal maturation and synaptic
function in a cell-type specific manner. Here, we propose to catalog and functionally characterize the
complexity of human isoform repertoires of SZ-associated genes using a single-cell long-read sequencing
based approach, and to study how genetic variations influence alternative splicing and impact neuronal
maturation and synaptic function in a subtype specific manner. This project will provide comprehensive
catalogs of cell-specific full isoform repertoires of SZ genes that will broadly facilitate SZ research. It will also
deepen the understanding of how genetic variations and alternative splicing contribute to SZ, help better
predict the clinical outcome and identify novel therapeutic interventions. The single cell approach used in this
project is generally applicable to study other mental disorders such as BD and ASD."

 Over 25 million people in the United States (US) have limited English proficiency (LEP). LEP populations
face substantial barriers to high-quality healthcare, resulting in disparate outcomes such as elevated risk for
serious safety events, increased costs, and decreased comprehension, satisfaction, and adherence.
Professional interpretation is an evidence-based practice to improve care and mitigate these disparities.
However, its use remains persistently low despite legal and regulatory mandates. Previous strategies to
improve use have mainly addressed intrapersonal barriers (provider knowledge and skills, via in -person
education) or the system (simplifying telephone interpreter access). Educational strategies have improved
provider knowledge with unknown effect on interpreter use; systems strategies have achieved modest
improvements in use. However, these strategies have lacked clearly articulated mechanisms or causal
pathways, often as part of expensive, multifaceted interventions that limit precise attribution and scalability.
 In this study, the investigators will compare two discrete implementation strategies for improving
interpreter use, the first an enhanced education strategy targeting primarily intrapersonal barriers but delivered
in a scalable format (interactive web-based educational modules), and the second targeting system barriers,
with a novel focus on mobile video interpretation (mVI), accessible on providers’ own mobile devices. The
study’s specific aims are: (1) Compare the effectiveness of two implementation strategies, alone and in
combination, to improve use of interpretation and comprehension for LEP patients/parents seen in
adult/pediatric primary care settings; (2) Explore mVI and education implementation strategies’ ability to
activate putative provider-level mechanisms; and (3) Determine the incremental cost effectiveness from a
healthcare organization perspective of each implementation strategy (mVI, education, both). To accomplish
these aims, the investigators will conduct a Type III hybrid implementation-effectiveness study in 6 primary
care clinics, using a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design . Enrolled providers
(total n=50) will be randomized to mVI or educational modules, in addition to standard interpreter access. After
9 months, providers with high interpreter use will continue as assigned; those with lower use will be
randomized to continue as before or add the alternative implementation strategy. Providers will complete
surveys and in-depth interviews to understand barriers to interpreter use, based on the Theoretical Domains
Framework. LEP patients will be surveyed (n=648) and interviewed (n=75) following visits with enrolled
providers to understand their experiences with communication and interpretation. Determining how these two
scalable strategies, alone and in sequence, perform for improving interpreter use, how they do so, and at what
cost, will provide critical insights for addressing a persistent cause of healthcare disparities."

The goal of this Bioengineering Research Grant (BRG) proposal is to develop fluorescent labels for single-cell
classification through imaging of intact three-dimensional tissue. We are focusing on semiconductor quantum
dots (QDs), nanocrystals that exhibit bright fluorescence and unique optical and electronic properties. We
designed new classes of QDs which we propose will allow quantitative, multispectral analysis of 30 or more
distinct molecules so that hyperspectral light sheet microscopy can be used to proteomically profile and
comprehensively map 20 or more distinct cell types throughout an intact tissue after a single staining step. This
technology addresses an outstanding bottleneck in optical microscopy of three-dimensional tissue, for which
only 3 distinct molecular markers can be easily distinguished, limiting the capacity to precisely classify cell types
and to co-localize different cell types. This proposal comes at a time when new light sheet microscopes have
recently become widely available for full-thickness imaging of optically cleared tissues at sub-cellular resolution
such that rapid advances in multiplexing could yield rapid impacts. As an example, the investigators of this project
developed workflows to optically clear, immunolabel, and image intact adipose tissues from lean and obese
rodent models, in addition to software to comprehensively identify cells based on fluorescent immunostains, and
deep learning algorithms to automate microenvironment segmentation. With these advances, we were able to
discover new classes of immune microenvironments in adipose tissue that are believed to promote comorbidities
of obesity, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. However key hypotheses regarding the nature of these
microenvironments cannot be readily addressed until we can discretely categorize cells based on their molecular
expression patterns within their contextual microenvironments. In this proposal, our technological goal is to
develop fluorophores for high-content multiplexing in intact tissues. Our biological goal is to use these tools to
understand immune cell microenvironments that regulate adipose tissue in the state of obesity. Our Specific
Aims are to (1) engineer the photophysics of new classes of QD-based labels, (2) conjugate these labels to
antibody fragments and validate their target specificity as molecular probes, (3) quantitatively evaluate cell
labeling and classification accuracy in three-dimensional adipose tissue, and (4) apply probe panels to quantify
adipose immune microenvironments at the cellular level in the lean and obese states. This is a collaborative
proposal between engineers and scientists with expertise in quantum dots and molecular probes (Andrew Smith),
advanced optical microscopy (Paul Selvin), biomedical image computing (Mark Anastasio), cellular immunology
(Erik Nelson), and animal models of obesity (Kelly Swanson)."
10749020,"SUMMARY OF WORK
Microglia-neuron crosstalk in development is critical for the formation and refinement of synaptic connections. In
this project, I propose to investigate a novel role for the neuron-derived cytokine IL34 in controlling the function
of microglia to close critical periods of synaptic plasticity in development. IL34, along with the canonical ligand
CSF1, signals through the CSF1 receptor on microglia to promote differentiation. Previous work suggests that
embryonic and neonatal microglia depend primarily on CSF1 from other glia, while adult microglia in regions
such as the cortex and striatum depend on IL34 from neurons. I have shown that IL34 expression increases
between postnatal day 8 (P8) and P15 in the anterior cingulate cortex. Interestingly, this window corresponds
with peak synapse engulfment in the ACC, suggesting that IL34 may play a role in dictating microglial function
rather than just survival. Furthermore, my preliminary data demonstrate that microglia in mice lacking functional
IL34LacZ/LacZ show an elevated inflammatory profile and do not upregulate microglial “maturity” marker TMEM119
between P8 and P15. The overarching goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that IL34 is a neuronal
activity-dependent signal that influences microglia function to close critical periods of developmental plasticity.
In Aim 1 I will investigate how chemogenetic activation or inhibition of neuronal activity in development controls
IL34 gene and protein expression in all neuron subtypes. In Aim 2, I will determine whether transiently blocking
IL34 or CSF1 impacts microglial pruning of thalamocortical synapses in the ACC, and if this has an effect of
communicative behaviors (USVs). These studies will elucidate the mechanistic implications of differential CSF1R
signaling in the brain during development, and the functional consequences for microglial."

Enumerix has developed a cost-effective method to perform high order DNA counting at high precision

partitions directly into PCR tubes for target amplification, using standard laboratory centrifuge and
thermal cyclers, followed by an ultra-rapid method to count up to 1 million copies of DNA directly from
the same PCR tube. We have demonstrated that our technology far exceeds the precision of digital
PCR, and can perform at a DNA counting range akin to quantitative PCR and next generation
sequencing, which makes it a suitable next-generation DNA counting platform. For this proposed Phase
II project we plan to further develop our dcPCR platform with the goal to distribute the technology to
end-users to replace quantitative PCR and digital PCR."

Protein aggregation is a hallmark of aging and age-associated disease, however a causal relationship has not
been demonstrated. Elucidating whether there is a predestined, irreversible driving force in cell aging would
enable the development of novel therapies to decelerate aging. Therefore, my long-term goal is to understand
this relationship at a fundamental level. My central hypothesis is that probabilistic, irreversible
conformational transitions in physiologically supersaturated proteins not only initiate the process of
cellular aging, but drive it!. The accumulation of amyloids following such transitions will compromise kinetic
proteostasis, or kinetic barriers for supersaturated proteins to remain soluble, and this ultimately compromises
thermodynamic proteostasis -- or the processes that maintain the concentrations and stabilities of soluble
proteins. I will utilize the following Specific Aims and synergistic approaches, distributed amphifluoric FRET
(DAmFRET), Epigenetic Clocks, and RNA-Seq, to distinguish the kinetic from thermodynamic determinants of
protein solubility as a function of cell age. In Aim 1, I will compare thermodynamic and kinetic proteostasis as a
function of biological age. To do so, I will first obtain primary human fibroblasts (PHFs) from differentially aged
donors, and validate their epigenetic age using DNA methylation signatures (DNAm) referenced against
previously developed DNAm age prediction algorithms, as well as RNA-Seq. I will then perform DAmFRET
experiments in each of the PHFs using a panel of inducible constructs that reliably aggregate in a nucleation-
and/or concentration-limited manner. These data will reveal the degree to which kinetic proteostasis and/or
thermodynamic proteostasis are impacted by biological age. In Aim 2, I will test if conformational nuclei
accelerate the aging of PHFs. I will generate generic light-activated optoSeeds from our reporter library in Aim
1 to elicit a conformational transition, or cross-seeding event, in PHFs of young age. I will then use multiple
mass spectrometry approaches to evaluate whether the nucleation event precipitated endogenous proteins,
and determine their identities. I will then determine if the treatment accelerates the progression of cell age via
DNAmAge and RNA-Seq. In Aim 3, I will test if perturbing kinetic proteostasis in the nucleus enhances the rate
of aging as compared to the cytosol. Using our optoSeeds, I will elicit a conformational transition in the nuclear
and cytoplasmic compartments. I will again use DNAm age prediction and RNA-Seq to determine whether age
is accelerated via conformational transitioning in the nucleus versus the cytosol. Completion of these aims will
provide fundamental insights into the thermodynamic reasons for why we age. In addition, completion of the
proposed studies will provide me with a strong foundation to continue my research as an independent
investigator."

 Autoimmunity against neuronal receptors causes an array of diseases. Cys-loop receptors are a class
of neuronal receptors targeted in autoimmune diseases including myasthenia gravis, autoimmune encephalitis,
and autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy. Myasthenia gravis is the longest studied; antibodies against the
neuromuscular nicotinic acetylcholine receptor were described in 1974. Autoimmune autonomic
ganglionopathy was first identified in 2000 as being associated with antibodies against the ganglionic nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors. Most recently, autoimmune encephalitis was associated with antibodies against the
related GABAA receptor. Mechanisms underlying autoimmune pathology are poorly understood but are often
attributed to receptor cross-linking and internalization. However, other mechanisms that include direct inhibition
of neurotransmission are increasingly reported. We have access to blood and cerebrospinal fluid from patients
suffering from myasthenia gravis, autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, and autoimmune encephalitis. Here
we propose to identify and clone autoimmune antibodies that target Cys-loop receptors. We will examine
functional receptor inhibition by patient-derived antibodies using electrophysiology. We will produce antibody
fragments to determine structures of the antibody-receptor complexes from different autoimmune diseases.
These structures combined with functional interrogation will illuminate conserved and divergent mechanisms of
autoimmune disease in this important protein superfamily. This work will lay the foundation for expansion to
other targets of the Cys-loop receptor family and beyond."

The most aggressive cases of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancers (BC) are diagnosed in young
women (<50 years-of-age). This project is focused on an understudied, aggressive, and therapy-resistant form
of ER+ BC that is characterized by predominantly ER+ luminal cancer cells interspersed with rare clusters of
ER-negative stem/progenitor cells that express the basal cytokeratin-5 (CK5). Patients with this mixed ‘lumino-
basal breast cancer’ (LBBC) phenotype represent a previously unrecognized population with unfavorable
prognosis. These tumors are aggressive due to their inherent ER-independent endocrine escape pathway, which
involves rapid expansion of the ER-/CK5+ cancer cell population in response to antiestrogen therapies.
Our data reveal that LBBC shares the younger age distribution and aggressive features of basal-like BC, a BC
subtype that is associated with pregnancy at early ages without breastfeeding – factors that are more prevalent
among Black and poorer women and thus may help explain disparities in BC. Intriguingly, the basal-like features
of LBBC are promoted by the pregnancy hormone progesterone and suppressed by the lactogenic
hormone prolactin. Compelling pilot data indicates that progestins or anti-estrogens expand the therapy-
resistant CK5+ stem/progenitor cell population in LBBC through a WNT11-PLZF-BCL6-dependent signaling
network and is reversed by prolactin.
The proposed studies will mechanistically test the general requirement of this WNT11-PLZF-BCL6 signaling
network required for antiestrogen and progesterone-driven expansion of the CK5+ cell population and LBBC
progression (Aim 1). Because the CK5+ cell population is often rare in untreated tumors, more robust diagnostic
classifiers for LBBC than CK5 alone will be developed (Aim 2). Finally, efforts will explore the efficacy of targeted
agents to disrupt this signaling network in vivo in preclinical models to provide rationale for new therapeutic
strategies for LBBC (Aim 3). In sum, we will mechanistically validate a newly discovered pathway that promotes
the therapy-resistant LBBC phenotype, develop better diagnostic methods, and explore therapeutic strategies to
overcome endocrine resistance of these tumors. The project holds potential for high impact progress that can
help reduce breast cancer mortality and morbidity."
10830339,"Project Summary/Abstract
Although long thought to be a unique feature of adaptive cells such as T and B cells, it is now clear that tissue
structural cells can also harbor ‘memory’ of prior inflammatory responses in the form of stable epigenetic
modifications that alter their transcriptional potential and behavior following subsequent tissue damage, and
this is referred to as ‘inflammatory memory’. This highlights key gaps in our knowledge of T cell-tissue cross-
talk that this proposal seeks to address. The premise of this proposal is that cutaneous T cells reprogram local
keratinocytes and fibroblasts during inflammation, thereby altering their transcriptional and epigenetic
landscape, function, and responses to subsequent stimuli, and that this influences the course and resolution of
inflammatory skin disease. To fill these key knowledge gaps, we will examine the cross-talk between T cell and
structural cells in innovative cell culture systems to monitor changes in cell behavior and function, and
mechanistically link them to transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming by T cell-derived cytokines. We will
also leverage an established and highly manipulatable murine model of T cell-dependent skin inflammation to
examine the development of inflammatory memory in KCs and Fibs in vivo, to mechanistically identify
important cytokines and epigenetic mediators, and to assess the functional consequences on subsequent
inflammatory and tissue-repair responses. Finally, we will analyze signatures of inflammatory memory in tissue
samples from patients with the common skin inflammatory diseases psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, and
assess epigenetic reprogramming in a preclinical model as a new therapeutic modality to reset inflammatory
memory and break the inflammatory cycle in the skin of these patients."

Millions of Americans suffer from unrelenting chronic pain conditions that are resistant to existing
treatments, and those who turn to opioid medication can develop dependencies that are devastating and
life threatening. There is essential need for more effective, non-addictive analgesics with limited side
effects. Voltage-gated calcium (CaV) channels are potential targets for improved pain therapeutics. CaV
channels are critical in altering sensory neuron sensitivity and in transmitting information about noxious
stimuli. Changes in sensitivity of sensory neurons to stimuli – such as heat and touch - can result in
transient forms of hypersensitivity and, if the stimulus is prolonged or especially intense, more prolonged
hypersensitivity, which can lead to chronic pain. CaV channels in the spinal cord are important for the
induction and maintenance of hypersensitivity, but the Lipscombe lab has recently shown that peripheral
CaV2.2 channels in heat sensing neurons in skin are also critical for this process. This proposal will
expand this discovery to investigate the functional contribution of peripheral CaV channels to
hypersensitivity in Trpv1-nociceptor and Aδ low threshold mechanoreceptor (Aδ LTMR) nerve endings in
skin. In Aim 1, optogenetics and automated, real-time behavior tracking with high-speed videography will
be combined to assess behavioral responses induced by direct activation of either Trpv1-nociceptor
(heat-sensing) or Aδ LTMRs (mechano-sensing). Changes in evoked behavior will be assessed following
sensitization of either neuron population as well as the potential for selective inhibition of peripheral CaV
channels to attenuate these outputs. Aim 2 will investigate intracellular calcium dynamics in nerve
endings in skin associated with the development of hypersensitivity. Integration of optogenetics, 2-photon
in vivo calcium imaging, and pharmacology, will uncover the individual contribution of CaV2.2 and CaV3.2
channels to calcium events in Trpv1-nociceptor and Aδ LTMRs that trigger hypersensitivity. This work
will provide unique data on the role of peripheral CaV channels in the induction of hypersensitivity and
may identify novel sites of action for developing more effective pain therapeutics, thereby reducing
unwanted side effects from actions in the central nervous system. The proposed research builds on the
applicant’s experience and provides an opportunity to develop unique expertise in genetic, behavioral, 2-
photon imaging and computation techniques. Collaborating with the Fleischmann and Moore labs for 2-
photon calcium imaging gives the applicant essential experience in team science and integrating across
different levels of investigation. This fellowship will also support the applicant’s professional development
in rigorous scientific methods and effective scientific communication. The Brain Science environment at
Brown University is exceptional for training, it provides numerous avenues for support, training, and
resources to prepare the applicant for a career as an independent academic scientist."
10805441,"R01: Investigating the impact of a fatty acid–cRel inflammatory circuit in atherosclerosis
ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
The objective of this grant to is to understand how inflammation and lipid metabolism are linked via circuits within
macrophages, and whether these circuits influence cardiometabolic disease. Although perturbations in lipid
homeostasis are recognized to be associated with inflammation in a number of human diseases, our
understanding of “how” and “why” the processes are intimately linked remains limited. Recent work has revealed
that pro-inflammatory signals can reprogram the lipid metabolic state of macrophages. It has also become clear
that perturbations in lipid homeostasis can be sensed by the inflammatory machinery of macrophages so as to
induce and to regulate inflammatory responses. Thus, lipid homeostasis and inflammation are interconnected,
and perturbations in one affect the other. In this proposal, we combine advanced analytical mass spectrometry–
based approaches with genetic models of inflammation, with the goal of defining mechanisms by which
inflammation drives reprogramming of the lipidome (and vice versa). Specific Aim 1 is to determine the
mechanisms by which alterations in monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) homeostasis regulate inflammation in
activated macrophages. Specifically, we will pursue our discovery that blocking de novo MUFA synthesis
potentiates inflammatory responses via the NF-κB member cRel. Using a combination of transcriptomics, ATAC-
Seq, and ChIP-Seq approaches, we will test the hypothesis that MUFA synthesis regulates inflammatory function
by specifically controlling cRel and the reprogramming the epigenome. Specific Aim 2 is focused on advancing
our understanding of how reprogramming of lipid metabolism occurs in macrophages, and determining the extent
to which reprogramming of lipid metabolism in monocytes and macrophages in vivo. By applying advanced
analytic techniques on tissue resident macrophages under normal, inflammatory and dyslipidemic conditions,
we will determine whether activation signals and lipid environmental cues can induce or shape lipid metabolic
reprogramming in vivo. We also further our understanding of how anti-inflammatory signals or ER stress signals
are integrated into this process of metabolic reprogramming. Specific Aim 3 is to determine the impact of the
SCD enzymes on dyslipidemia, chronic inflammation, and atherosclerosis in mice. The SCD proteins have been
reported to both potentiate and attenuate atherogenesis. We suspect this is due to the complicating factor that
there are multiple SCDs. In this aim, we ask if the combined loss of SCD1 and SCD2 specifically in macrophages
exacerbate inflammation, dyslipidemia and atherogenesis. Conversely, can enforced SCD expression in
monocytes and macrophages protect from disease. Likewise, does loss of cRel ameliorate inflammation and
atheroma formation in response to western diet. It is our expectation that our proposed studies will define, at a
molecular level, why dysregulation of macrophage lipid homeostasis drives inflammation, and how inflammation
influences macrophage cholesterol metabolism in cardiovascular disease."
10814781,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Almost 400,000 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occur each year in the United States. In
patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for prolonged periods, current CPR methods are
unable to maintain adequate blood flow and oxygen delivery to the vital organs. Survival is <10% in patients
with shockable rhythms and ~0% in those with non-shockable rhythms. Current American Heart Association
(AHA) recommendations for CPR follow a “one-size-fits-all” paradigm. Our goal is to improve vital
organ perfusion during prolonged CPR by “personalizing” compression/decompression
therapy with a dynamic CPR method that changes compression characteristics over the course of
CPR after taking into account the temporal changes of chest wall compliance and hemodynamics in order to
increase the rate of neurologically intact survival after OHCA.
 In this grant proposal, we are investigating the deployment of machine learning algorithms incorporated
into a mechanical CPR device to predict and optimize hemodynamics during CPR. We will use state-of-the-art
dynamical modeling in conjunction with closed-loop control algorithms to
individualize CPR characteristics and optimize temporal blood flow. Our preliminary results suggest that
deployment of machine learning prediction algorithms paired with control algorithms in a preclinical Ventricular
Fibrillation model can adapt compression and decompression depth in real time, resulting in increased vital
organ blood flow as compared to standard CPR techniques Based on these results, we hypothesize that
optimization of compression depth, decompression depth, duty cycle, and compression rate of CPR will lead
to better outcomes. Our proposed research will: 1) identify the most promising algorithm for the prediction of
CPR hemodynamics 2) identify the best control algorithm to pair with this prediction algorithm in terms of
optimizing CPR hemodynamics and return of spontaneous circulation 3) use the prediction and control pairing
to improve 48h neurologically intact survival in a porcine model of ventricular fibrillation, as compared to
standard CPR techniques. Throughout this process, we will identify non-invasive alternative measurements to
provide to the algorithms with the ultimate goal of proceeding with device development and human trials."

This application seeks renewal of a long-standing, innovative and highly successful postdoctoral training
program in Nutrition that has a primary goal of training the next generation of physician scientists and PhD
researchers committed to disease prevention and health promotion through careers in Nutrition. As
suboptimal diets have surpassed tobacco smoking as the leading global mortality risk factor, the rationale
for an outstanding nutrition research workforce is compelling. The training program, based in a major
academic medical center, addresses 3 broad themes: 1) obesity and its co-morbidities; 2) nutrition, diet and
eating behavior; and 3) lifecourse and development. Faculty mentors include a balanced mix of MD (10)
and PhD (14) researchers representing 5 academic units in the university, and whose nationally recognized
research spans basic (T1) to translational (T4) approaches. All faculty are affiliated with the NIH-supported
Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute, which offers excellent support for translational
research and numerous training and career development programs. Trainees to date typically have been
physicians (1 position) seeking a career in academic medicine and nutrition-related research and PhD’s (2
positions) pursuing postdoctoral training in one of our thematic areas. The specific objectives of the training
program include achieving excellence in all aspects of the scientific literature and methods relevant to
trainees’ areas of research, with an emphasis on understanding scientific rigor and reproducibility and
guiding principles of ethical conduct in research; mastering basic principles of Nutrition Science; preparing
and submitting research grants and manuscripts; and acquiring skills for professional development and
communication to undertake a successful academic career. The program provides 2-3 yr of research
training, which includes ongoing rigorous work with a primary mentor, and interaction with faculty leadership
and all trainees supported by this T32 plus other pre- and postdoctoral trainees through participation in
weekly Nutrition Journal Club, professional development series and Nutrition seminar series. Of recent past
trainees, two-thirds have obtained grant funding, and 80% have progressed to careers in academic settings.
Based on increases in the quality and number of applicants, including physicians, relative to number of
available slots, we propose an additional position for the next cycle, thus projecting 2 MD and 2 PhD
trainees. The training environment promotes collaborative research and fosters productive interaction
between physicians and PhD researchers, a model that prepares trainees to be exceptionally well
positioned to emerge as future leaders in Nutrition to address the most compelling global health challenges."
10634514,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The ultimate goal of this project is to develop the flexible, non-occlusive Ω-Cuff as a simple and safe device to
treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is the inability of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES)
to keep the acidic stomach content from coming back up excessively into the esophagus that can cause major
discomfort, disrupting daily lives and can lead to esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, strictures, and cancer.
40 million U.S. GERD patients manage their symptoms by life-long prescription medications such as Proton
Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) of whom 16 million will need other options due to either ineffectiveness or side effects.
GERD is the most expensive of all the GI diseases, with an annual U.S. healthcare cost >$12 billion and
growing. Due to its risks and significant physiological perturbations, the gold standard fundoplication surgery
treats <30 thousand patients. Ω-Cuff improves upon a less morbid partial fundoplication surgery by having a
simpler, easier, safer and more durable treatment. A straightforward laparoscopic procedure places the Ω-Cuff
directly onto the esophagus without altering anatomy or physiology. Ω-Cuff works symbiotically with the
esophagus to mitigate dysphagia common to other surgical treatments, to reduce medication dependence and
healthcare costs.
We successfully completed the required preclinical safety tests. Ω-Cuffs were manufactured and implanted
over the LES area in a 1-year, 24-pigs Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) study without adverse events. The
device could be safely explanted. Ω-Cuff passed the panel of ISO 10993 biocompatibility, corrosion, nickel
leaching, and fatigue cycling durability tests. It was also found to be MRI compatible at both the 1.5 and 3.0
Tesla levels, allowing patients to safely go through standard MRI diagnoses, if needed. An Investigational
Device Exemption (IDE) has been granted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a clinical feasibility
study. This proposal has the following aims. Specific Aim 1: Manufacture Ω-Cuff in 5 sizes for the clinical
study. Per FDA mandate, we will manufacture 5 sizes (20 each) for the clinical study. Specific Aim 2: Conduct
human clinical early feasibility study with 8 patients. The study is an observational, prospective, non-
randomized, open label, feasibility study of patients receiving the Ω-Cuff device, to evaluate the safety of Ω-
Cuff and its ability to reduce the GERD symptoms in augmenting the function of the LES. Specific Aim 3:
Prepare report and document for an IDE amendment to expand into a pivotal study. The intent of this clinical
feasibility study is to establish a basis for expanding into a pivotal study to complete the clinical validation
process. Commercialization will commence after completion of the pivotal clinical study and receiving approval
from the FDA to market Ω-Cuff in Phase III."
10792467,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Early Life Adversity (ELA), defined as childhood experiences which require significant adaptation beyond the
child’s developmental stage, is of critical concern, as it is reliably predictive of increased risk for the leading
causes of morbidity and increased severity, chronicity, and overall risk for psychiatric disorders. Dysfunction in
neural reward and threat systems may represent a mechanism through which ELA increases risk for later
psychopathology; however, few studies have examined the proximal impact of ELA on reward and threat
processing in early childhood, prior to periods of enhanced risk for psychopathology onset. Conceptual models
suggest that different forms of ELA may differentially impact neural reactivity, and indeed, studies find that
experiences of threat to one’s safety may be more strongly linked to enhanced threat sensitivity while exposure
to deprivation, such as neglect, may be more strongly tied to blunted reward processing. Previous studies have
been limited by small sample sizes and adolescent or adult samples due to the cost-prohibitive,
developmentally-challenging nature of methods previously used (i.e., neuroimaging). Electroencephalogram
(EEG) may enhance investigations of ELA and neuroaffective processing, given that EEG is cost-effective and
developmentally sensitive. The reward positivity (RewP) is an event-related potential component which indexes
neural reward responsiveness while the error-related negativity (ERN) captures threat sensitivity. Preliminary
evidence indicates support for dysregulated processing styles (i.e., enhanced ERN, reduced RewP) related to
greater ELA exposure; however, this relationship has been relatively unexamined in children. In addition,
decomposition of ERP components into frequency rather than time-domains represents an innovative, novel
method for enhancing nuanced understanding of the targeted influence of ELA on neuroaffective processing.
The current proposal seeks to replicate and extend findings regarding relations between ELA and reward and
threat processing to an early childhood sample (n = 120 5-6 year olds) using reliable, developmentally-
sensitive neurophysiological tools. The candidate will first evaluate the impact of ELA, particularly experiences
of deprivation, on indices of reward processing (i.e., RewP, underlying delta; Aim 1). We will then test the
impact of ELA, particularly experiences of threat, on neural threat sensitivity (i.e., ERN, underlying theta; Aim
2). Finally, we will explore maternal caregiving as a moderator of ELA-affective processing relations (Aim 3).
The proposed aims will address the applicant’s training goals by providing: 1) knowledge of conceptual models
of ELA and key developmental constructs, 2) training in EEG collection, preprocessing, and advanced
analyses, and 3) advanced statistical training for developmental research. Findings have the potential to inform
targets for early, preventive intervention for ELA-exposed youth to alter risk sequelae for later psychopathology
and enhance overall health and human capital. The proposed F31 will contribute to the applicant’s career goal
of becoming an early career researcher examining predictors of affective dysfunction and internalizing risk."
10840282,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This application proposes a customized research training plan designed to promote the development of the
applicant into an independent investigator. The plan includes advanced training in both bioinformatics and
laboratory experimentation, along with tailored professional and career development opportunities. The training
plan is supported by the outstanding availability of local and institutional resources at UIC. The proposed
research will examine the mechanisms that control scar formation, a common result of the healing response. In
adults, the outcome of wound repair is almost always a fibrous scar composed of disorganized extracellular
matrix (ECM). Although regulation of scar formation is complex, a key feature is fibroblast (FB) activation,
which generates ECM and contractile forces. Scarring and fibrosis occurs in many tissues and can cause
significant impairments of the organ system affected. Recent studies in our lab have identified a novel FB
function in wounds that may be linked to scar formation. These studies show that wound FBs can act as non-
professional phagocytes and ingest apoptotic cells. Following apoptotic cell engulfment, FBs develop a fibrotic
phenotype with enhanced migration, increased contractility (α-SMA expression), and increased collagen
synthesis. One factor found to be significantly upregulated in fibrotic phagocytic FBs is microfibril-associated
protein 5 (MFAP5 or microfibril-associated glycoprotein 2/MAGP2). MFAP5 influences microfibril function and
can regulate cell signaling pathways. Interestingly, MFAP5 has been linked to fibrosis in several human
diseases, including some cancers and fibrotic diseases. Still, little is known regarding its role in wound healing
and scar formation. Therefore, the goal of this study is to gain a better understanding of the function of MFAP5
in skin healing and scar formation. We hypothesize that upregulation of MFAP5 in the healing skin wound
modifies the FB response and promotes scar formation. In this study, the role of MFAP5 in wound healing
will be investigated in Mfap5-/- mice, a well-established Mfap5 knock out mouse line. The effect of MFAP5 on
FB phenotype will be further investigated in vitro. This proposal will utilize in vivo and in vitro wound healing
assays and advanced bioinformatics techniques. Aim 1 will assess how the loss of MFAP5 affects wound
healing, including scar collagen content and architecture, wound breaking strength, myofibroblast activation,
angiogenesis, and wound closure. Single-cell RNA sequencing will be used to identify the FB subpopulation
that produces MFAP5 during wound healing. Aim 2 will examine how MFAP5 influences FB function and gene
expression by utilizing in vitro wound healing assays as well as bulk RNA-sequencing and functional pathway
analysis. Together, the Aims will lead to a better understanding of the importance of MFAP5 in healing skin
wounds and scar formation. Information gained from the proposed research may lead to the development of
novel therapeutics and/or discovery of a prognostic biomarker for treatment of fibrotic diseases."
10836344,"In the face of a public health crisis of pathogenic bacteria resistant to most existing antibiotics, bacteriophages
(bacterial viruses; phages) that naturally infect and kill bacteria, represent a promising alternative for use as
antimicrobials. However, a significant obstacle to realizing this translational goal is presented by the plethora of
immune mechanisms in bacteria to resist phage infections. Overcoming this obstacle necessitates phages
equipped with robust anti-immune capabilities to kill multiple isolates of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria.
In that regard ΦKZ-like jumbophages (phages with genomes > 200kb) emerge as a family with an outstanding
ability to thwart a multitude of bacterial nucleolytic immune systems throughout infection and numerous family
members that infect most important Gram negative pathogens. The jumbophage ΦKZ is a broad-host range
killer of the multi-antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the leading model
phage for the jumbophage family. Immune evasion is achieved largely through the assembly of a
phage-encoded proteinaceous nucleus-like “shell “compartment that encapsulates and shields the replicating
phage genome. However, it is unknown how this phage protects its genome prior to the assembly of the shell.
The long term objective of this proposal is to understand the mechanisms used to guard the ejected genome of
ФKZ-like jumbophages–preliminary evidence (from us and others) suggests the assembly of a macromolecular
compartment in infected cells at similar locations as the ejected jumbophage genome (prior to shell assembly).
Currently, the composition and biological significance of these complexes remain unknown. I hypothesize that
this complex (termed herein the ‘ejected structure’) creates a DNA-containing organelle that encapsulates and
protects the ejected phage genome from immune nucleases. I will first use fluorescence microscopy and
cryo-electron tomography to visualize the infection state prior to shell assembly. From these studies I will gain
high resolution structural insight into the biogenesis and organization of these compartments. In parallel, I will
use mass spectrometry to reveal the constituents of these assemblies and subsequently interrogate the
functional roles of these constituents in supporting phage infection. From my multidisciplinary studies, I stand
to uncover fundamentally new phage biology in addition to innovative and potentially transferable mechanisms
to enhance phage success in the fight against pathogenic bacteria.
I will perform this work at UCSF, an institute that hosts state-of-the-art research facilities and fosters an
intellectually rigorous and collaborative research environment. Co-supervision in the Bondy-Denomy and
Agard labs will ensure thorough training in phage biology, genetics and biophysics. Through the course of my
research, I will undergo extensive training and subsequently gain expertise in diverse fields of microbiology,
molecular biology, biophysics and structural biology that I need to fulfill my postdoctoral training goals and
subsequently pioneer an independent research program."
10839771,"Project summary:
The adaptive immune system can specifically recognize and kill cancer cells. Therapies that reinvigorate
tumor-specific CD8 T cells cure a subset of patients with lung cancer, prompting their FDA approval and use
as standard of care. Tumor-reactive T cells recognize cancer cell antigens -- displayed fragments of proteins
that are unique to tumor cells. To date, study of anti-tumor immunity has primarily focused on antigens derived
from somatic mutations in the cancer genome, which are insufficient to fully explain the anti-tumor immune
response. Moreover, mutation-derived neoantigens are generally unique to each tumor, and targeting them
might require bespoke treatments for each patient. The long-term goal of this proposal is to expand the
paradigm of cancer-specific antigens. Recent work has uncovered a novel class of cancer-restricted antigens
produced by abnormal splicing events. While several cancers harbor recurrent driver mutations in splicing
factors, few studies have explored the relationship between dysregulated splicing and tumor immunogenicity.
Notably, ~10% of lung adenocarcinomas feature loss-of-function mutations in RBM10, a critical splicing factor.
This work will examine splicing-derived antigens in Rbm10-deficient tumors. The central hypothesis is
that Rbm10 deficiency will generate aberrantly spliced transcripts, which will elicit an adaptive immune
response if translated and presented as novel antigens by tumor cells. This hypothesis will be tested in a well-
characterized murine model of lung adenocarcinoma by pursuing two specific aims. In Aim 1, mRNA
sequencing will be performed to characterize aberrant splicing events that occur in the context of Rbm10
deficiency. Mass spectrometry will be used to validate that aberrantly spliced RNAs produce antigens
presented to the immune systems. In Aim 2, CRISPR/Cas9 will be used to introduce Rbm10 mutations in an
immunocompetent, autochthonous murine model. Histologic and flow cytometric analyses will be performed on
infiltrating lymphocytes in Rbm10-deficient and proficient tumors to assess endogenous anti-tumor immunity.
This research study is innovative in that it proposes to empirically test the role of splicing-derived antigens in
anti-tumor immunity using genome engineering in autochthonous mouse models. It is significant because it
may identify new, tumor-restricted antigens that are targetable by cancer immunotherapies. While T-cell
targeted immunotherapies provide durable cures for patients with advanced cancer, prior studies emphasize a
limited set of cancer-specific T cell antigens. The ultimate objective of this work is to uncover novel
mechanisms to potentiate immune recognition of cancer cells, leading to the development of new therapies for
lung cancer."

Our global population is aging faster than ever, promising challenges for healthcare and community wellness.
Affective processes are known to support health and wellbeing across the lifespan. Consequently, a better
understanding of these processes has profound implications for the prevention and treatment of health disorders
(e.g., geriatric depression, cardiovascular disease, dementia) and for policies supporting adults into later life.
Older adults reliably report greater positive emotions, less aroused negative emotions, and greater emotion
regulation efficacy compared to younger adults. These changes have primarily been attributed to age-related
shifts in cognitive processes like attention, memory, motivation, control, and self-regulation. However, older
adults also demonstrate less robust autonomic responding during emotion, lesser sensitivity to bodily sensations
(interoception), and maladaptive gut-based decision-making. Collectively, these findings point to a novel
hypothesis: the Physiological Hypothesis of Emotional Aging (PHEA). PHEA hypothesizes that age-related shifts
in functional activation and connectivity within the allostatic interoceptive brain network (AIN) produce changes
in emotional experience via concurrent changes in interoception and peripheral reactivity. The proposed project
evaluates this hypothesis across three scientific aims leveraging data from sponsor Lindquist’s on-going cohort
study of adults (n = 120, 18-80 years old). Participants in this study complete an in-lab session, one week of
experience sampling, and a functional brain scan yielding measures of physiological reactivity, interoceptive
ability, and emotional reactivity both in-lab and in-daily life. The proposed project is accompanied by 6 specific
training objectives that will help the applicant to build new expertise in the neurobiology of affective aging, cutting-
edge experimental methodologies (e.g., in-scanner acquisition of autonomic physiology, ultrahigh resolution
functional brain scanning), and data analytic techniques (e.g., graph theory). The scientific aims and training
objectives outlined in this proposal will better our understanding of basic mechanisms underlying
healthy and disordered emotional aging; will help scientists, practitioners and policymakers address the
health needs of our aging population; and will support the applicant’s transition into a productive and
independent research scientist."

Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients have a dismal survival rate due to distant metastases that
escape primary care. Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) is a well-known driver of metastasis, modulator of
immune cell activity, and regulator of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes. In breast cancer, a stiff ECM is generally
attributed to excess type I collagen deposition and crosslinking that promotes cancer cell metastasis and cancer
stem cell (CSC) expansion. In OSCC, a consensus has not been reached on whether a stiff or soft ECM
increases metastatic potential and CSC expansion. The impact of OSCC ECM composition on immune cell
trafficking is also unknown. Our laboratory has produced murine OSCC cell lines derived from Keratin15+ stem
cells with Smad4 loss and KrasG12D mutation. Despite having the same genetic background, these cell lines have
different metastatic ability, suggesting microenvironmental factors or cell intrinsic differences may mediate
metastasis. RNAseq analysis revealed that metastatic OSCC cells have increased levels of laminins and laminin-
binding integrins but downregulated type I collagen genes. Additionally, while OSCC cells cultured on stiff ECM
demonstrate increased invasion, those cultured on a soft ECM display increased CSC characteristics. Treating
metastatic OSCC cells with a TGFβ inhibitor reduced migration and invasion. Comprehensive immune profiling
using flow cytometry revealed that metastatic tumors have decreased numbers of CD8+ T infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs) compared to non-metastatic OSCC tumors. These CD8+ TILs are instrumental for a robust
anti-tumor immune response and the success of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. Identifying
responders to ICI and TGFβ inhibitors and sensitizing non-responders to these therapies persist as a major
obstacle. Defining how OSCC cells interact with the ECM to promote their dissemination and enhancing current
prognostic markers are both crucial to improve patient care and prolong survival. The goal of this proposal is
to use unique murine models and human patient samples to define how ECM components and rigidity influence
OSCC CSCs metastasis to improve the efficacy of emerging, targeted therapeutics to inhibit OSCC metastatic
outgrowth. The hypothesis of this proposal is that elevated TGFβ signaling in OSCC induces increased
integrin expression and a laminin/collagen imbalance in the ECM, altering ECM stiffness and modulating OSCC
metastasis, OSCC CSCs, CD8+ TIL motility and ICI responsiveness. I will 1) evaluate TGFβ-dependency and
function of laminins and associated integrins in OSCC metastasis; 2) determine how laminins contribute to ECM
rigidity and subsequent impact on OSCC CSC characteristics and motility; and 3) assess if inhibiting laminin
deposition enhances ICI. This study will provide insight into how enhanced laminin-binding integrin expression
and laminin deposition facilitates OSCC metastasis, CSC characteristics, and CD8+ TIL exclusion. It will also
identify predictive prognostic biomarkers for ICI and therapeutic targets for treating metastatic OSCC."

The ultimate goal of this project is to explore the feasibility and mechanism of an allele-specific, RNAi-based
genetic medicine approach to treating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH). NAFLD/NASH is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. However, no proven drug for
NAFLD/NASH is available. There is an urgent need to identify novel targets and develop promising drugs for
both NASH prevention and treatment. Recent GWAS has identified that a genetic mutation (148I>M) in the
patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) gene is the single largest genetic risk factor
contributing to the progression of NAFLD to NASH. Our and others’ studies demonstrated that the PNPLA3148M-
associated NASH should be classified as a unique disease. Mechanistically, our team recently demonstrated
that accumulated PNPLA3148M protein isoform on lipid droplets competes with PNPLA2 (also known as ATGL)
for α/β-hydrolase-domain-containing 5 (ABHD5, or CGI-58), an important activator for PNPLA2, blocking the
ABHD5-mediated, PNPLA2-driving lipolysis and leading to triglycerides accumulation in lipid droplets. We thus
hypothesize that transcriptional downregulation of the PNPLA3148M isoform is a cause-targeting strategy for the
treatment of NAFLD/NASH among patients carrying the PNPLA3148M allele. To this end, we have developed and
patented an allele-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) that possesses excellent potency and specificity for
downregulating the PNPLA3148M mutant isoform but not its wild-type isoform (148I). We have further discovered
two more modified oligonucleotides with excellent pharmacological properties. To facilitate the preclinical
evaluation of these agents, we have developed a humanized PNPLA3148I/M mouse model, which recapitulates
the typical NASH phenotype and related comorbidities. Delivering our siRNA into this mouse model with N-
Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-conjugation, a well-established, clinically validated, and liver-specific RNAi drug
delivery strategy effectively knocked down hepatic hPNPLA3148M mRNA and ameliorated the liver histology. With
this success, we propose to advance our drug development by evaluating the efficacy, toxicity, and mechanism
of action of our therapeutics for both NASH prevention and treatment, with the final goal to generate the first
precision genetic medicine for PNPLA3148M-specific NASH. We aim in this study 1) to evaluate and compare the
efficacy of our 3 hPNPLA3148M-targeting, GalNAc-conjugated oligonucleotide therapeutics; 2) to evaluate and
compare the safety and toxicity of our therapeutic candidates; and 3) to explore the mechanism of action of our
therapeutics. We expect that via this study, we will eventually develop the first genetic medicine for NAFLD/NASH
prevention/treatment, which could also serve as a new prototype for drug development for other common human
diseases. The collected data in this study will generate the most promising therapeutic lead for late-stage pre-
clinical and the first-in-human studies."

This competitive renewal 1) expands on a prospective longitudinal study that defines the natural history of
shoulder pathology in manual wheelchair users and an age and sex matched able-bodied referent group, 2)
improves the arm use metrics measured during daily living, and 3) determines risk factors of arm use that
accelerate shoulder pathology and pain progression beyond that of natural aging. Additionally, this proposal
performs a large retrospective population-based cohort study to investigate the risks of comorbidities and
medication to a future clinical diagnosis of shoulder pathology or pain. Abundant evidence exists that
individuals with spinal cord injury who use manual wheelchairs are much more likely than age matched able-
bodied individuals to have rotator cuff pathology and/or shoulder pain. This clinical problem has been receiving
attention for decades, yet shoulder pain and dysfunction continues at unacceptably high rates. To maintain the
health and independence of a population that relies on their upper extremities for all activities of daily living, our
objective is to define the natural history of rotator cuff disease in MWC users with the long-term goal of
advancing evidence-based guidelines to decelerate the disease progression. The rate of pathology
progression is largely unknown for MWC users, especially early in the disease when nonsurgical interventions
may be appropriate. Aim 1 addresses this need by tracking the progression of rotator cuff tendinopathy, partial
tears, and pain worsening while quantifying the effect of sex, SCI lesion level, and time since SCI. Inarguably,
higher rotator cuff pathology rates among manual wheelchair users is attributable to the altered shoulder
function during daily living. However, clinical care would be improved if it was known which extrinsic factors of
daily arm use differentiated MWC users whose pathology progression was more accelerated from those whose
pathology did not progress or progressed more slowly. Aim 2 uses wearable sensor technologies to determine
the association between daily arm use (arm posture, repetitive movement, and recovery) and progression of
rotator cuff pathology and pain. Intrinsic factors, including comorbidities and medication use, have been
associated with tendon pathology in the able-bodied literature but they are unstudied in the spinal cord injured
population. Therefore, Aim 3 will evaluate the contribution of comorbidities and medication use to the onset of
rotator cuff pathology and pain in a population-based cohort. By studying factors that differentiate those who
have increased rates of pathology progression from those with stable or improving pathology; actionable
intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors can be defined. These steps are fundamental for providing a basis for patient
education and rehabilitation strategies. By focusing on the early stages of rotator cuff pathology, this study is
likely to lead to rehabilitation strategies to implement prior to the development of shoulder dysfunction among
individuals who rely on their shoulders for independence."

10846663,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs) are essential for action potentials in excitable cells located throughout
the body (central nervous system, smooth muscle, heart and skeletal muscle). Loss of, improper, or untimely
function, can each cause or contribute to disease. Many individual point mutations in the genes of NaV or
accessory proteins have been associated with disease; some of which can be life threatening. Many disease
associated mutations are located at or are near NaV accessory protein binding sites; therefore significant effort
has been put forth by many investigators to characterize the mechanisms that underlie ion channel gating
modification and in physiology and disease.
 It is well established that Ca2+ alters NaV function, and the Ca2+ sensing protein Calmodulin (CaM) has
a prominent role in this process. Structural investigations have identified several distinct CaM-NaV interactions.
However, the posited physiological function and interpretation of data are controversial. Early studies relied on
measuring NaV function in the absence or presence of Ca2+ and generated seemingly disparate results.
Subsequent investigation revealed the mechanism(s) of Ca2+driven NaV modification are complex and involve
multiple accessory proteins, thereby rendering much of the data ambiguous.
 Recently, I identified a high-affinity interaction between CaM and part of NaV that is directly responsible
for inactivating NaV conduction. I was able to utilize my in-depth structural characterization to impair the
interaction without conferring additional modification to NaV function. This is a notable accomplishment given
this part of the channel undergoes rapid conformational change during each functional cycle. Because of this, I
could for the first time clearly attribute modified NaV function to reduced CaM binding. My data demonstrate
that channels with this reduced CaM interaction require longer to recover from the inactivated state.
 Considering my structure / function findings with available literature suggest a paradigm of CaM
Facilitated Recovery from Inactivation (CFRI). As demonstrated in my recent papers and preliminary data, CaM
engages several NaV isoforms with high affinity, suggesting a universal model of regulation. My findings are in
direct conflict with other reports that posit models of CaM Dependent Inactivation (CDI) and [Ca2+] insensitivity.
These opposing models arise from knowledge gaps regarding (i) the kinetic rates of CaM interactions and (ii)
the precise role of each CaM interaction in an excitable cell that contains oscillating [Ca2+].
 My proposal addresses these knowledge gaps by uniquely combining structural biology, stopped-flow
kinetics, and electrophysiology to dissect the roles of the CaM-NaV interactions in excitable cells. I will then
explore if I can alter the kinetics of specific interactions by engineering a small molecule probe. This work will
test CFRI (physiology and disease), as well as explore novel strategies for treating NaV channelopathies."
10837796,"ABSTRACT
 Anxiety disorders remain one of the most common forms of mental illness and the 6th leading cause of
disability worldwide. Anxiety pathology tends to emerge during early adolescence, and this process occurs
differentially between the sexes, with rates becoming 2- to 3-fold higher in girls (vs. boys) post-puberty. Thus,
identifying adolescence-specific factors that predispose towards anxiety disorders is crucial for identifying at-risk
individuals early, before trajectories crystalize, and for providing novel intervention targets. Interestingly, the
developmental course of anxiety is inversely related to the maturation of emotion-regulation capacity, with
decrements in capacity appearing during the transition into adolescence. We and others have proposed that the
development of adolescent anxiety is due, in part, to differences in the maturational trajectories of brain networks
supporting emotion regulation (i.e., emotion dysregulation is a key endophenotype for anxiety development).
However, the adolescent- and sex-specific neurobiological mechanisms that support the development of emotion
regulation, and their implications for the manifestation of anxiety pathology, are not well understood. We will test
a model incorporating two risk factors: pubertal testosterone and axonal myelination of prefrontal-subcortical
circuits. We will collect longitudinal (3 waves, each 1 year apart) multi-modal (e.g., diffusion, ultra-fast fMRI)
neuroimaging data from individuals at the transition into adolescence, half of whom are at high risk for developing
an anxiety disorder. Aim 1: We recently proposed a model in which testosterone dampens the effectiveness of
key emotion-regulation circuitry, whereas myelination of white matter in that circuit has the opposite effect. Aim
1 will evaluate this model by testing whether (i) increases over time in pubertal testosterone are linked to
functional decoupling between orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and amygdala and (ii) this decoupling predicts emotion
dysregulation and consequent anxiety increases. This aim will also test whether sparser baseline myelination of
uncinate fasciculus (connecting OFC-amygdala) is linked to weaker functional coupling, higher dysregulation,
and anxiety. Aim 2: The biological mechanisms that confer greater risk for anxiety in females remain unknown.
Our work in healthy adolescents suggests that females have a higher sensitivity to testosterone in the OFC-
amygdala circuit, and there is some evidence of myelination differences in this circuit. Aim 2 will test whether
testosterone and myelination have a greater impact on emotion-regulation circuitry/pathological anxiety in girls.
Aim 3: It is critical to identify baseline biomarkers predictive of future anxiety development in order to detect at-
risk individuals before trajectories crystalize. Aim 3 will test whether testosterone and myelination can be used
to predict the emergence of future anxiety. In sum, this project aims to identify neural and hormonal mechanisms
responsible for the development of adolescent anxiety. This work has the potential for tremendous public health
impact by harnessing cutting-edge methods to uncover and validate novel risk trajectories for anxiety."

 Multiple vascular diseases including hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and others are associated
with the dysfunction of vascular endothelium. However, there are currently no effective methods to incorporate
new endothelial cells into damaged vessels in vivo which could contribute to vascular regeneration and repair.
 New blood vessels form by two distinct mechanisms, vasculogenesis, which is differentiation of
vascular endothelial cells de novo, and angiogenesis, formation of new vessels by branching from the existing
vessels. It is currently thought that vasculogenesis is largely limited to the initial vascular network during
embryogenesis, while the majority of the later vessels form by angiogenesis from the existing vasculature.
 While it is difficult to study vasculogenesis in the mammalian embryos, zebrafish has emerged as an
advantageous model system to study vascular development. Molecular mechanisms that control vascular
development are highly conserved between all vertebrates including zebrafish and humans.
 Here we have discovered a novel population of putative vascular progenitors in the zebrafish embryos.
These cells show high expression of ETS transcription factor etv2, a known key regulator of vasculogenesis,
and are located adjacent to the pronephros (pronephros-associated cells, PACs). Our preliminary data indicate
that PACs are the major source of organ specific vasculature, and they contribute to the embryonic vasculature
by a novel mechanism of cell intercalation into functional blood vessels. Our data further suggest that PACs
are likely conserved in mammalian embryos. In addition, we have identified Junctional Adhesion Molecule
Jam2b as one of key regulators required for PAC formation. We hypothesize that PACs are a novel group of
multipotent vascular progenitors which provide important contribution for vascular growth.
 The following specific aims are proposed: 1) Define contribution of PACs to different types of blood
vessels; 2) Identify functional role for PACs in vascular development; 3) Identify the role of Jam2b and other
upstream regulators in the formation of PACs and vascular development. Lineage tracing approaches will be
employed to determine contribution of PACs to different types of vessels in zebrafish embryos. PAC ablation
and etv2 conditional inhibition strategies will be used to test the functional role of PACs in zebrafish, and their
formation will also be investigated in murine embryos. The role of jam2b in PAC formation, its interaction with
Vegf signaling pathway, and functional roles of other PAC-enriched genes will be analyzed in zebrafish.
 Data obtained in this proposal will answer the key questions regarding the identity and functional role of
PACs, and are likely to uncover a novel mechanism of vascular growth. The mechanisms of vasculogenesis
are highly conserved, and our preliminary data suggest that similar progenitors are also present in the
mammalian embryos. Understanding the mechanism of how PACs form and incorporate into existing
vasculature may lead to a new direction to repair damaged vessels for therapeutic purposes."

Depression and falls are significantly higher in low-income, racially diverse homebound seniors than in the
general older-adult population; however, the existing systems of care are not equipped to address disparities in
mental health and fall prevention services for these vulnerable older adults. The long-term objective of the
proposed study is to improve access to depression treatment and fall prevention for growing numbers of low-
income homebound seniors. Specific aims are to compare clinical and cost effectiveness of integrated tele-
delivered behavioral activation (Tele-BA) and fall prevention (FP) by bachelor’s-level lay counselors/coaches to
Tele-BA or FP alone and attention control (AC). The current and projected shortages of licensed clinicians and
the costs of deploying highly trained professionals pose barriers to providing services to older adults in general
and low-income homebound seniors in particular. A more scalable option is to utilize lay counselors/coaches,
and our recent clinical trial (1R01MD009675) and a FP pilot study show that lay counselors/coaches are as
effective as licensed clinicians. The study participants will be 320 low-income, racially diverse homebound
seniors who are served by a home-delivered meal (HDM) program and other aging-service agencies in Central
Texas. The lay counselors/coaches will be co-located in the HDM program for seamless referral and care
coordination. In a 4-arm, pragmatic clinical trial with randomization prior to consent (a preferred public health
approach), the participants in the integrated Tele-BA and FP (TBF hereafter) arm will receive 5 Tele-BA
sessions and 4 in-home FP sessions. Those in the Tele-BA or FP alone arms will receive the respective
intervention and 4 bimonthly telephone check-in (booster) calls, and those in the AC arm will receive 5 weekly
telephone check-in calls followed by 4 bimonthly follow-up calls. Study hypotheses are: At 12, 24, and 36
weeks after baseline, (1) TBF will be more effective than Tele-BA or FP alone, and Tele-BA or FP alone will be
more effective than AC in reducing depression (the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression), falls, and
fall injuries; (2) TBF than Tele-BA alone or FP alone will be more effective in reducing disability (WHODAS 2.0)
and healthcare and social service use; and (3) TBF will be more cost effective than Tele-BA alone or FP alone.
Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) will be based on depression free days, prevented falls, and health-related
quality adjusted life-year measured by EuroQol-5 (EQ-5D). We will also conduct budget impact analysis (BIA)
of TBF relative to Tele-BA or FP. Both CEA and BIA will employ a hybrid public program perspective of the
Administration for Community Living and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Public health significance of
this study is that it will provide empirical data needed for real-world adoption of an intervention delivery model
that targets to intervene for the two most frequent sources of disability acceleration and healthcare use among
a rapidly growing, underserved population. (We use the terms older adults and seniors interchangeably
because the latter term is frequently used in aging services.)"

The research projects that have been supported by the COBRE Center for Central Nervous System Function
involve a wide range of complex neuroimaging and non-invasive brain stimulation methods used both
individually and in multiple combinations. These methods include, but are not limited to, structural MRI, task-
based and resting state functional MRI, diffusion imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct-
current and alternating-current stimulation, galvanic skin response, electroencephalography, and eye tracking.
The complexity of these techniques and the challenges of mastering the infrastructure required to effectively
and efficiently deploy them can significantly impede research progress, especially in the case of relatively early
stage investigators. The function of the the Phase 3 Behavior and Neurodata Core (BNC) is to provide ongoing
expert support, training, assistance and advice to the Brown researchers in the practical aspects of data
collection, data management and data processing related to these methods. The specific aims of the BNC are
(1) to continue to provide support and assistance to past COBRE Project Leaders and their research teams
and the broader research community, to promote and facilitate the acquisition of high quality research data;
and (2) to expand the areas of support to include new initiatives, including support for part fabrication, video
tracking, and behavioral task design. To meet these aims, the Core will coordinate the deployment and
maintenance of shared research infrastructure to ensure that research equipment is functional and well
documented. The Core will collect and evaluate quality assurance data to ensure that data collected are of
high quality and to identify and correct problems at an early stage. The Core will provide researcher training,
individually and in group settings, in order to promote the use of “best practices” when collecting data using a
variety of methods. It will provide expert consultation to researchers so as to guide their choices regarding the
complex and interacting acquisition parameters that must be speciﬁed for various acquisition techniques. BNC
experts will aid in deploying and supporting new analytical tools and platforms to ensure that researchers have
access to state-of-the-art methods and tools for processing their complex data sets. The BNC will create robust
data processing pipelines for the analysis of neuroscience research data that leverage the existing and
growing computational infrastructure available at Brown. The BNC will assist with data management to ensure
that large research datasets are available when needed and protected. In coordination with the Center for
Computation and Visualization, the BNC will provide training and support for the use of high-performance
computing resources. By meeting these goals, the BNC will (1) accelerate the pace of neuroscience research,
(2) establish supportive collaborative relationships among COBRE investigators throughout the local research
community based on common solutions to shared challenges, and (3) ensure the availability and accessibility
of high quality physical and computational research infrastructure to the broader brain science community."

The pathway from conception to adulthood is influenced by many factors including genetics, social factors,
nutrition, infection and inflammation and the environment. The impact of these factors depends on the type and
timing of exposures, relative to critical windows of vulnerability. Experimental science focused on
understanding, measuring, and intervening on factors that influence reproductive and pediatric health is
especially challenging due to the innate vulnerability of these populations. Epidemiology provides a rigorous
methodological framework to interrogate important questions about reproductive, perinatal, and pediatric health
and disease. Epidemiologists are trained to estimate the prevalence of reproductive and pediatric conditions,
causal relationships between a range of exposures and outcomes, and the role social determinants play in
creating health disparities. Epidemiologic methods are also valuable for evaluating the implementation of
interventions to improve reproductive and pediatric health outcomes. Rigorous methods tailor study design to
maximize data quality and carefully construct analyses to minimize bias and emphasize interpretation. Our
Reproductive, Perinatal, and Pediatric Epidemiology Predoctoral Training Program prepares the next
generation of epidemiologists to investigate the real world contextual and interacting influences of genetics,
physical environment, and social environment that impact reproductive, perinatal, and pediatric health. Training
comprises didactic training and mentored research, complemented with professional development and
enrichment opportunities. Primary and Affiliate Preceptors have extensive research portfolios and a range of
expertise to offer. Trainees gain appreciation for the biological underpinnings of reproductive and pediatric
health. They learn to identify longstanding and emerging problems and apply rigorous research methods in
complex, real-world settings to study them. Trainees complete our program with a sophisticated
methodological toolbox, experience integrating methods with substantive area knowledge, and requisite
professional skills to engage in collaborative science that advances the field and tackles important research
questions that impact reproductive and child health."

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is an essential metabolite involved in various cellular processes.
NAD+ metabolism is also an emerging therapeutic target for several human diseases. The NAD+ pool is
maintained by three biosynthesis pathways, which are largely conserved from bacteria to human. The
regulation of NAD+ metabolism is incompletely understood due to the dynamic flexibility of NAD+ intermediates,
the redundancy of biosynthesis pathways, and the complex interconnections among them. The major goal of
this proposal is to uncover novel signaling factors that regulate NAD+ homeostasis and to study the underlying
mechanisms. Our studies utilize the genetically tractable budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that has
consistently served as an efficient model system to study cellular mechanisms broadly conserved among
eukaryotes. We have recently established an NAD+ intermediate-specific genetic system to identify factors that
regulate each branch of the NAD+ biosynthesis pathways. Our studies have uncovered novel NAD+
homeostasis factors including transcription factors, NAD+ intermediates transporters, and nutrient-sensing
signaling pathways. The current proposal builds on our recent studies of these factors and the interplay
between components in NAD+ metabolism and longevity-related nutrient signaling pathways. Our studies in
Project 1 and Project 2 will address specific hypotheses derived from our recent studies to elucidate the
mechanisms of regulation. A few major gaps in our knowledge of the mechanisms regulating NAD+
homeostasis will be addressed: 1) Which and how signaling pathways regulate NAD+ homeostasis? 2) Which
and how cellular processes contribute to the turnover of NAD+ and its intermediates? 3) What is the molecular
basis for the cross-regulation of NAD+ biosynthesis and nutrient-sensing pathways? The long-term goal is to
understand how cells maintain NAD+ homeostasis in response to changes in growth conditions. The major
hypothesis is that NAD+ homeostasis is co-regulated by nutrient-sensing signaling pathways. Intracellular
compartmentalization of NAD+ intermediates and homeostasis factors also contribute to the complex interplay
of NAD+ homeostasis factors and nutrient sensing pathways. To achieve theses goals we will employ a
combination of molecular genetics and biochemical methods to analyze genes, proteins and pathways
involved. These studies will increase our understanding of how eukaryotic cells regulate NAD+ homeostasis in
response to changes in growth conditions, and which longevity-related nutrient sensing signaling pathways are
involved. Overall Significance: NAD+ preservation helps ameliorate age-associated metabolic disorders. Our
findings will contribute to understanding the molecular basis and regulation of NAD+ homeostasis as well as the
mechanisms underlying metabolic disorders related to aberrant NAD+ metabolism in human."

 This proposal will be focused on the understanding of mechanisms of two fundamental biological
phenomena in eukaryotes: the circadian clock and codon usage bias. Circadian clocks control diverse cellular,
physiological, and behavioral processes in eukaryotic organisms. Our long-term goal is to understand the
molecular and biochemical mechanisms that permit the measurement of time and the output of circadian
rhythms in eukaryotic circadian clocks. Our previous studies made fundamental contributions to the
understanding of the eukaryotic circadian clock mechanisms. Synonymous codons are not used with equal
frequencies in all genomes examined, a phenomenon called codon usage bias. Even though the phenomenon
of codon usage bias has been known for several decades, the functions and mechanisms of codon usage bias
are unclear. Our previous work demonstrate that codon usage is a novel layer of the genetic code that can
determine both gene expression levels and protein structures. Our lab uses Neurospora, Drosophila and
mammalian systems to study these two phenomena.
 For the circadian clock project, we propose to focus on several key aspects of the circadian oscillator
mechanism in both Neurospora and mammalian clock systems. We will determine the role and mechanism of
FRQ-CK1a interaction in circadian period determination in Neurospora. In addition, we will expand our study
into a mammalian system by determining the role of the PERIOD-CK1 interaction in the mammalian circadian
clock. These studies will establish a conserved mechanism for period determination in fungi and animals.
Although FRQ in Neurospora and PER proteins in animals are not considered homologous, most of the
domains in both proteins are predicted to be intrinsically disordered and both are progressively
phosphorylated. We will determine how FRQ and PER function in the circadian clock using biochemical and
molecular methods. For the codon usage project, we will build on our ground-breaking discoveries on the roles
and mechanisms of codon usage biases in determining gene expression and protein structures. We will
determine the mechanism of the codon usage effect on gene transcription in Neurospora based on a
previously performed large-scale genetic screen. This study will reveal the mechanisms that underlie the
conserved effect of codon usage on gene transcription. We will evaluate how codon usage influences gene
expression in mice by creating an in vivo codon usage reporter. This study will establish the mechanism that
contributes to effects of codon usage on tissue- and cell type-specific gene expression in mammals. In
addition, we will develop a method to modulate translation elongation speed based on the role of codon usage
in regulating protein folding that will have potential for use in treatment of many diseases. Together, these
studies will address fundamental questions that are critical for our understanding of these two biological
phenomena in eukaryotes."

The broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research are to improve understanding of the pathogenesis of
inherited retinal degeneration (IRD) due to mutations in genes that encode RNA splicing factors so that
therapies can be developed for these blinding disorders. Mutations in 6 genes that encode components of the
spliceosome, the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex that catalyses pre-mRNA splicing, have been identified to
cause dominant IRD, including Pre-RNA Processing Factor 3 (PRPF3), PRPF4, PRPF6, PRPF8, PRPF31, and
SNRNP200. Together, mutations in these 6 genes are the second most common cause of dominant IRD.
Despite being relatively common, the mechanism(s) by which mutations in genes that encode components of
the spliceosome and that are utilized in mRNA splicing ubiquitously lead to retina specific disease remain to be
defined. Since all 6 dominant RNA splicing factor IRD disease genes encode proteins that are components of
the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP (small nuclear RNP) subunit of the spliceosome, it is hypothesized that altered RNA
splicing underlides the retinal degeneration in the RNA splicing factor forms of IRD. There is also good
evidence that mutations in PRPF genes cause cell autonomous defects in RPE function, providing a model
system for studies of disease pathogenesis and potential treatments. In the past funding period transcriptome
analyses of tissues from PRPF31 mutant mice and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived RPE
cells were performed. Analyses of the data from the Prpf31 mutant mice indicate that the majority of
differentially expressed (DE) genes in the RPE are targets of the AP-1 transcription factor complex. Further,
alternative splicing (AS) of 11 genes that encode regulators of AP-1 activity was detected. These preliminary
data provide a strong starting point for the proposed research, which is directed towards defining the causal
chain of molecular events that lead from mutations in RNA splicing factors to retinal degeneration, and using
this information to inform development of therapies for RNA splicing factor associated IRD. In Aim 1 the
hypothesis that altered mRNA splicing of AP-1 regulators leads to down-regulation of AP-1 subunits in RPE
cells will be tested by expressing the altered transcripts of the AP-1 regulators in RPE cells in culture and in
vivo. The goal of Aim 2 is to test the hypothesis that altered mRNA splicing of genes associated with AP-1
complex activity also underlies RPE dysfunction due to mutations in human RNA splicing factor genes. This
will be accomplished by performing transcriptome analyses of PRPF mutant hiPSC-derived RPE cells. In Aim
3 high content screening methods and CRISPR/Cas9 - based genome perturbation screens will be used to
identify genes who altered expression is responsible for RPE dysfunction in PRPF-associated disease. Finally,
the hypothesis that information derived from these studies has the potential to be used therapeutically will be
tested by “treating” PRPF mutant hiPSC-RPE with inhibition or activation of genes found to be associated with
RPE dysfunction with the goal of restoring RPE function."

The stability of eukaryotic genomes relies on the tight coordination of DNA metabolic processes with DNA
repair and the cell cycle. Central to this coordination are elaborate signaling networks mediated by DNA
damage signaling kinases. Mutations in these kinases are associated with a range of human genetic disorders
linked to cancer predisposition, neurological defects, and immunodeficiency. Selective inhibitors of DNA
damage signaling kinases are now being used in over a hundred clinical trials for cancer therapy. However,
fundamental questions related to how these kinases maintain genome integrity remain unanswered. The
Smolka Laboratory investigates DNA damage signaling, with a major focus on the phosphatidylinositol 3′
kinase (PI3K)‐related kinases (PIKKs) and PIKK‐regulated downstream checkpoint kinases. In addition to
pioneering the use of proteomic approaches for the unbiased mapping PIKK substrates, our work uncovered
new mechanisms of DNA repair regulation and DNA damage signaling deactivation. Over the next five years,
our research program will explore novel non-canonical roles for PIKKs in genome maintenance and DNA
replication that have remained obscured for decades. We will address fundamental questions regarding the
identity of key effector proteins by which PIKKs control DNA synthesis and DNA repair transactions,
establishing the underlying mechanisms of phospho-regulation and implications for manipulating cellular
viability, fitness and drug susceptibilities. We will employ extensive phosphoproteomics and genetic
approaches, and incorporate single molecule super resolution microscopy, CRISPR screens and genomic
technologies. The proposed work will reveal crucial, yet undefined, layers of PIKK-dependent regulation
governing genome maintenance and DNA replication in yeast and mammals. Generated knowledge will also
have implications for understanding how cells with unstable genomes, such as cancer cells undergoing
oncogene-induced replication stress, co-opt PIKK signaling for unrestrained proliferation and resistance to
genotoxic insults. Moreover, our findings will illuminate how inhibitors of PIKKs, already in clinical trials,
affect cell viability and genomic integrity, thus informing the design of more effective therapeutic strategies."
10814162,"Arenaviruses are endemic in rodent populations and can be transmitted to humans to cause severe life-
threatening hemorrhagic fevers. Relevant US agencies (DHHS, DHS and DoD) and the WHO recognize these
viruses as high priority pathogens that pose a serious threat to public health and national security. The live-
attenuated Candid#1 strain of Junín virus (JUNV) is currently used in Argentina to protect against Argentine
hemorrhagic fever, but this virus carries the distinct liability that attenuation is solely dependent on a single
phenylalanine-to-isoleucine substitution at position 427 (F427I) in the GP2 fusion subunit of the JUNV
envelope glycoprotein (GPC). Indeed, reversion at the attenuating position occurs readily in cell culture and in
laboratory animals. The current proposal seeks to capitalize on our understanding of GPC structure and
function to design recombinant Candid#1 (rCan) viruses that stably maintain attenuation without compromising
protective efficacy. We have discovered an epistatic interaction between the attenuating F427I mutation in GP2
and a lysine-to-serine mutation at position 33 (K33S) in the stable signal peptide (SSP) subunit of GPC that
provides an evolutionary barrier against reversion to the pathognomonic F427. Pilot studies indicate that K33S
rCan is indeed attenuated in guinea pigs and capable of eliciting protective immunity against lethal challenge
with JUNV. We hypothesize further that safety in a K33S rCan vaccine can be additionally enhanced by
incorporating well-characterized and genetically stable GPC deletions. By characterizing rCan viruses that
embody these strategies, we aim to enhance safety in a second-generation rCan vaccine. Towards this goal,
we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1. Determine the degree of attenuation and genetic stability
of K33S rCan in mice. We will utilize well-established mouse models to determine the degree of attenuation in
rCan variants and confirm the genetic stability of the attenuating F427I mutation. Aim 2. Assess the balance
of attenuation, immunogenicity and protective immunity of K33S rCan in the guinea pig model of lethal
JUNV infection. Guinea pigs serve as the gold-standard model for assessing Candid#1 attenuation and
protective efficacy. We will expand upon our pilot findings to optimize the balance between attenuation and
protective efficacy. We will evaluate production of virus-neutralizing antibodies, an accepted surrogate of
protection, and the ability of the vaccine to elicit virus-specific CD8+ T cells. Aim 3. Design and characterize
rCan variants bearing redundant and genetically stable mutations that promote attenuation. We have
identified two deletions in GPC that support rCan infectivity. We will characterize rCan variants bearing these
deletions to integrate additional layers of attenuation. Taken together, our efforts will establish an optimal
balance of attenuation, genetic stability and efficacy in a second-generation rCan vaccine, and elucidate the
molecular basis for attenuation and the immunologic correlates of protection. These strategies may also be
applicable towards the development of an urgently needed live-attenuated Lassa virus vaccine."

 Animals of many species develop as two anatomic sexes that perform distinct and complex social
behaviors. Across clades, master regulator transcription factors downstream of sex determination programs
“switch” distinct brain regions and neurons involved in sex-typical behaviors by altering neuron number,
anatomy, and connectivity. In insects, the male-specific transcription factor Fruitless (FruM) is required during
development for mating behaviors, including innate courtship behavior towards conspecific female virgins. FruM
changes the number, anatomy and connectivity of neurons which comprise the circuit. However, how FruM
executes these disparate genomic programs during development, when these programs hard-wire mate
choice, and how the developmental landscape constrains the function of FruM is still poorly understood. To
address these questions, we propose to investigate how FruM establishes and maintains changes in neurons of
the courtship circuit by altering chromatin accessibility of regulatory elements across constituent neurons. We
will investigate 1) the repressive activities of FruM on neurodevelopmental genes in circuit connectivity and
function, and 2) determine how and when FruM acts on the chromatin landscape to hard-wire courtship
behavior. In this proposal, we will thereby elucidate the molecular and circuit function of FruM that hard-wires
mate choice and courtship behavior during development of the circuit.

Surgery and acute post-operative pain are major contributors to persistent pain, chronic pain, and opioid
dependence. Currently, there are no products on the market in the United States that can be used to monitor
surgical nociception. Existing products use indicators that are susceptible to intraoperative influences such as
blood loss, anesthetic drugs and antihypertensives. This leaves anesthesiologists to guess whether or not the
analgesic therapies they are providing will be effective at managing intra-operative nociception and subsequent
post-operative pain. A significant fraction of surgeries also rely on regional anesthesia techniques, and, these
techniques are not foolproof, and may fail during surgery, leading to potentially uncontrolled postoperative pain
that is apparent only when the patient recovers consciousness after surgery in intense pain. As it stands,
anesthesiologists have no way to directly assess the ongoing efficacy of their regional blocks, leading to
unreliable nociception and pain management. Therefore, improved methods to monitor surgical nociception are
clearly needed. This project proposes to develop new technology that makes it possible for the first time to use
event-related potentials (ERPs) to actively assess pain and analgesia during general and regional anesthesia.
ERPs are generated by painful stimuli and can be measured at the scalp by averaging waveforms from repeated
stimuli generated by a variety of methods including electrical stimulation. ERPs are challenging if not impossible
to use for anesthesia monitoring because they are very small, between ~1 to 10 microvolts, and are
overshadowed by background electroencephalogram oscillations that are 10- to 100-fold larger in amplitude
during general anesthesia or sedation. Recently, we developed a novel technology for processing ERPs that
increases their precision ~150-fold even in the presence of orders-of-magnitude larger background oscillations.
Using this knowledge, we propose to develop this technology for commercial use in a “Fast-Track” STTR project."

The mechanisms linking adiposity with breast cancer and how variation in adipose tissue distribution contribute
to inequities in breast cancer recurrence and mortality remain to be determined. Untangling the complex
interactions among adiposity, race and ethnicity, and breast tumor phenotype is a first step, which requires
precise adiposity measures and identification and refinement of adiposity-associated biomarkers within breast
tumor tissues that can predict breast cancer outcomes. Our preliminary research has shown that the distribution
of visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous adipose tissue – assessed by computed tomography (CT) – scans
differ by race and ethnicity and outperforms body mass index (BMI) in predicting cancer outcomes. Our prior
research also showed that gene and protein expression of the adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, and their
receptors vary in breast tumor tissues and generally, lower expression is associated with more aggressive tumor
features (e.g., higher grade, larger size, hormone receptor negative status, and triple-negative subtype). Further,
we found that increased body fatness measures – general obesity (BMI), body fat distribution (waist
circumference, hip circumference, WHR), and body composition (fat mass index, percent body fat) – are
associated with higher leptin receptor protein expression in breast tumor tissues, with evidence of effect
modification by race. Building on these preliminary studies, we hypothesize that adipose tissue depots (visceral
vs. subcutaneous) have differing associations with adipokine and adipokine receptor expression profiles and
related gene signatures in the breast tumor microenvironment (TME). Using multiplex RNA in situ hybridization
to characterize the abundance of adipokine and adipokine receptor expression in the breast TME, CT scans to
assess adipose tissue distribution, and RNA-seq for transcriptomic analysis in a large, diverse cohort of 1600
women with breast cancer, we will: (1) Test whether adiposity is associated with cell type-specific RNA
expression profiles of leptin, adiponectin, and their receptors in breast tumors and the adjacent breast TME; (2)
Define associations between RNA expression profiles of leptin, adiponectin, and their receptors in the breast
TME with tumor clinicopathology; and (3) Characterize RNA expression profiles associated with leptin,
adiponectin, and their receptors in the breast TME to predict breast cancer recurrence and mortality. This study
will yield novel insights on how adipose tissue distribution impacts gene expression profiles in the breast TME
and new information about potential differences by race and ethnicity and tumor subtype. Such data are critical
for efforts to integrate tumor markers and systemic factors into breast cancer risk and outcome prediction models,
and to informing the development of precision prevention interventions and precision therapeutics for diverse
breast cancer patients."

Glioblastoma (GBM), the most lethal primary brain tumor with poor prognosis, is highly resistant to current
treatments, including immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) partially due to the immune suppressive
microenvironment. GBM harbors abundant tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that are critical immune
cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Because the majority of TAMs are tumor-promoting macrophages
(pTAMs, M2-like) that augment malignant growth, promote therapeutic resistance, and mediate immune
suppression, reprograming pTAMs into tumor-suppressive macrophages (sTAMs, M1-like) represents a
promising therapeutic strategy. As pTAMs establish the immunosuppressive microenvironment that negatively
impacts current immunotherapy, redirecting pTAMs into sTAMs not only activates macrophage phagocytosis of
glioma cells but may also remodel the immune microenvironment to facilitate current ICB. To identify small
molecules that can reprogram pTAMs into sTAMs to promote macrophage phagocytosis of glioma cells, we
designed a cell-based fluorescent screening assay, using GFP-labeled iPSC-derived macrophages and
tdTomato-expressing glioma cells including glioma stem cells (GSCs) to discover drug candidates and
corresponding molecular targets. To this end, we found that several specific inhibitors of BACE1 (β-site
amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1) could effectively stimulate macrophage phagocytosis to engulf
glioma cells including GSCs, and thus identified BACE1 as a therapeutic target to reprogram pTAMs into
sTAMs. We demonstrated that BACE1 is preferentially expressed by pTAMs in human GBMs and is required
for maintaining pTAM polarization. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 by its inhibitor MK-8931
(Verubecestat) potently redirected pTAMs into sTAMs and promoted macrophage phagocytosis of glioma cells
to inhibit GBM growth. Furthermore, we found that low doses of radiation (IR) markedly enhanced TAM
infiltration and synergized with MK-8931 treatment to suppress GBM tumor growth. As several BACE1
inhibitors including MK-8931, initially developed for Alzheimer's disease, have been demonstrated to be safe
for humans in clinical trials, repurposing these inhibitors for the macrophage-based cancer therapy should
straightforward and promising. As abundant pTAMs largely contribute to the immune suppressive
microenvironment, reprograming pTAMs into sTAMs through BACE1 inhibition may remodel the TME to
facilitate current ICB. Thus, we hypothesize that reprograming pTAMs into sTAMs through
pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 synergizes with current immune checkpoint inhibition to improve
therapeutic efficacy for GBM. We will accomplish our objectives through the following aims: (1) We will
assess the effect of reprograming pTAMs into sTAMs on the immune microenvironment in GBM; and (2) We
evaluate the therapeutic impact of TAM-based therapy in combination with current ICB for GBM. The outcomes
will inform future clinical trials to improve treatment for GBM and potentially brain metastases."

Altered serotonin signaling is linked to brain disorders like depression and schizophrenia. A current hypothesis
is that serotonin 'modulates' the action of other neural signals with critical roles in depression. However, the vast
complexity of the human brain makes it challenging to test this idea, and there is no neural circuit in any organism
in which we understand in mechanistic detail how serotonin modulates other signals. This project seeks to fill
this gap in knowledge by determining how serotonin modulates other signals in a powerful model system: the
well-studied neural circuit that controls egg-laying in the C. elegans nematode. A pair of HSN neurons release
serotonin to make the vulval type-1 and type-2 muscle cells (vm1s and vm2s) and the ventral cord type C (VCs)
neurons more excitable. Simultaneous contraction of the vm1s and vm2s is required for egg laying. The VCs
release acetylcholine to depolarize the vm2s; however, so far, no signal that could depolarize the vm1s and thus
be potentiated by serotonin has been identified. I discovered that a pair of poorly-studied neurons called PVW
produce branches that end in presynaptic termini over the vm1s. My preliminary data also shows that the PVW
branches have strong calcium transients during egg laying, and that silencing PVW's activity mildly inhibits egg
laying. Furthermore, weaker PVW calcium transients are observed when the vm1s produce small twitches that
do not result in egg laying. My central hypothesis is that the PVW branches provide the unknown excitatory
signal that triggers vm1 contractions and that serotonin potentiates this effect to result in egg laying. My first aim
is to determine if the PVW branches form chemical and/or electrical synapses onto the vm1s. I will use
fluorescent presynaptic protein markers to examine if the PVW varicosities contain small-clear vesicles, dense-
core vesicles, and/or gap junctions. I will also analyze existing electron micrographs to reconstruct the
ultrastructure and synaptic content of the PVW branch onto the vm1s. Next, I will use trans-synaptic labeling
methods to determine if the PVW varicosities contact the vm1s. My second aim is to use a genetically-encoded
fluorescent calcium indicator to record PVW neural activity within freely-behaving animals to determine if PVW
is active when the vm1s are activated, and to study if the HSN or VC neurons modulate PVW's activity during
egg laying. My third aim is to manipulate PVW activity with optogenetic and chemogenetic methods to test if the
PVW neurons provide a serotonin-potentiated signal that excites the vm1s to induce egg laying. I will silence or
induce PVW and VC activities to determine if both neurons are necessary and/or sufficient to induce egg laying
in the presence and absence of serotonin. Lastly, I will use RNAi to disrupt presynaptic gene function in PVW to
investigate if PVW uses neurotransmitter, neuropeptide, or gap junction signaling to induce egg laying and excite
the vm1s, using ratiometric calcium imaging to read out vm1 activity. This study will provide the most detailed
analysis to date of how serotonin modulates the response of a cell to an excitatory signal within a neural circuit,
advancing our understanding of how serotonin dysfunction in brain circuits might contribute to mental disorders."

 There is an increasing need to improve the characterization of lipids and saccharides for clinical and
biomedical research purposes. NMR is the method of choice for obtaining detailed structural information about
saccharides. However, NMR typically requires milligram (micromole) quantities of analyte; this often exceeds
biologically relevant levels. For lipids, mass spectrometry (MS) provides an efficient avenue for rapid profiling,
but quantitative analysis is challenged by difficulty in isolating species of interest due to wide structural diversity.
 A new MS approach is proposed that fundamentally addresses challenges in quantitative and qualitative MS
by utilizing online accelerated droplet chemistry. Since ion suppression effects in electrospray ionization (ESI)
MS occur during droplet formation, our method is designed to tackle this intellectual challenge exactly at the
point of droplet formation – not before by adding reagents in solution, and not after by performing gas-phase
reactions. This strategy simplifies instrumentation requirements and allows effective coupling to liquid
chromatography (LC). Selected droplet-based reactions improve signal-to-noise ratios to enable femtomole
sensitivity using <1 µL sample volume. Gas-phase ion intensities generated by our platform reflect the
corresponding analyte concentration in solution. Importantly, selected droplet-based reactions allow isomers of
lipids and saccharides to be differentiated. We propose to couple online droplet reactions with LC to enable high
throughput quantification of lipids and saccharides in complex mixtures. The specific research aims are:
 Aim 1: To develop a functional contained-electrospray platform for coupling accelerated droplet
chemistry on LC-MS for saccharide analysis. A novel contained-ESI source is proposed to couple droplet
chemistry with LC-MS. Our method will enable LC mobile phase and ESI spray solvent to be independently
optimized. This orthogonal feature is expected to allow effective separation of isomeric saccharides (linkage,
anomeric, and position isomers). Selected droplet reactions will improve detectability of saccharides and provide
a second layer of identification for isomers that co-elute. The LC-contained-ESI-MS/MS platform will be validated
via high throughput combinatorial studies.
 Aim 2: To develop a plasma-droplet fusing contained-electrospray source for coupling LC-MS for
lipid analysis. We propose to include etched silica capillaries on our LC-contained-ESI-MS/MS platform for
accurate quantification of all types of lipids, including triglycerides. The device is expected to enable
instantaneous determination of degree of unsaturation, C=C bond position, and bond orientation (cis/trans).
 The tandem development of quantitative analytical methods for lipids and saccharides will result in
concomitant creation of versatile platforms for applications in diseases diagnosis and high throughput analysis
of rare sugars to effectively guide synthetic method development. The proposed strategy will also be valuable in
biomedical research using existing instruments without modification."
10758570,"The Coats plus syndrome is a rare and life-threatening genetic disorder characterized by multi-system
developmental defects that lead to bilateral exudative retinopathy, retinal telangiectasias, growth retardation,
intracranial calcifications, bone abnormalities, gastrointestinal vascular ectasias, and common early-aging
pathological features. Like many other developmental disorders, Coats plus is caused by defects in genes
involved in maintaining global genome integrity. Specifically, it is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the
human CTC1/STN1/TEN1 (CST) complex, which is a trimeric complex that preferentially binds to G-rich ssDNA
or ss-ds DNA junctions and is critical for preventing genome instabilities arising from replication perturbation. We
hope to aid in better understanding of disease development and designing of effective therapeutic strategies by
investigating the mechanisms governing genome stability under replication stress. In response to fork stalling,
signaling cascades activate multiple pathways including fork reversal, translesion synthesis, repriming
downstream of stalled sites, and dormant origin firing to rescue stalled replication. Activities of these pathways
need to be tightly regulated to ensure replication fidelity. The objectives of this proposal is to delineate a novel
signaling pathway in response to replication stress, elucidate how it regulates protein interplays and recruitment
at stalled forks, and understand the mechanism regulating the repriming pathway. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that
a calcium-dependent signaling pathway phosphorylates STN1 to activate CST at stalled forks to protect the
stability of stalled forks. We will elucidate this new signaling pathway and determine how this pathway
antagonizes unscheduled nascent strand DNA degradation and regulates fork protection. In Aim 2, we will
investigate how this signaling pathway regulates the interplay of single-strand DNA binding proteins at forks and
other fork binding proteins. In Aim 3, we will investigate the mechanism for restricting excessive repriming to
prevent ssDNA gap formation and genome instability. We will combine highly sensitive cell-based analyses,
single-molecule and powerful biochemical assays to accomplish the goals of the proposed research. We expect
that our efforts will identify new factors and pathways regulating the rescue of stalled replication and the
preservation of genome stability."
10805391,"TITLE: IDENTIFYING THE NEURAL MECHANISMS OF GOAL-DIRECTED DECISION-MAKING IN
PARKINSON’S DISEASE USING CLOSED-LOOP DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION
PROJECT SUMMARY
People with Parkinson’s disease commonly suffer from non-motor symptoms, including motivation deficits, that
impact quality of life more than classical motor symptoms and are exacerbated by current treatments like
dopaminergic drugs and deep brain stimulation. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the neural
basis of motivated decision-making to develop new therapies that can re-tune reward networks and address
this therapy gap. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify the neural signals that implement top-down,
goal-directed control of choices and their causal role in decision-making. My central hypothesis is that theta
frequency activity in the basal ganglia is required for implementing top-down control over decisions, and that
inhibiting the basal ganglia with closed-loop neurostimulation based on theta activity will reduce goal-directed
decision-making. Therefore, the rationale of the project is that identifying the neural signals underlying goal-
directed decision-making and causally manipulating them in a reward learning paradigm will reveal biomarkers
that can be used to re-tune these circuits and treat behavioral disorders. The central hypothesis will be tested
by pursuing two Specific Aims: Aim 1) Identify spatially and spectrally specific neural network signals for goal-
directed decision-making. We will record chronic frontal cortical and basal ganglia activity using
electrocorticography and sensing-enabled deep brain stimulation devices implanted in patients with
Parkinson’s disease while they perform a reward learning task. We will quantify choice strategies using
reinforcement learning models and relate goal-directed decision-making to neural signals, both ON and OFF
dopaminergic medications. Aim 2) Test the causal role of theta in goal-directed decision-making using closed-
loop brain stimulation. We will trigger inhibitory deep brain stimulation in the basal ganglia when theta power is
high to disrupt goal-directed decisions, thereby establishing the causal role of theta in top-down control of
decision-making. The research is innovative because it will be the first to use chronic, multi-site, invasive
electrophysiology and closed-loop brain stimulation to establish causal relationships between specific neural
signals and goal-directed decision-making in humans. It is significant because it will lead to biomarkers to
guide diagnosis and treatment of motivation deficits in patients with Parkinson’s disease and other
neuropsychiatric conditions. Dr. Hoy has assembled an interdisciplinary team of mentors led by Dr. Simon
Little and supported by Drs. Philip Starr, Wouter Kool, and Winston Chiong. Together, they have designed a
comprehensive training plan involving (1) closed-loop deep brain stimulation and subcortical neurophysiology,
(2) reinforcement learning computational modeling, (3) neuroethics, and (4) professional development. This
fellowship will facilitate Dr. Hoy’s evolution into a leader in reward neuroscience and invasive human
neurotechnology. It will also prepare him to develop a K award grant application as a means to transition into
an independent academic researcher."
10893932,"PROJECT SUMMARY
ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that includes attention difficulty, impulsivity, and
hyperactivity. The diagnosis is associated with many challenges to educational, occupational, and health
outcomes, particularly when untreated. Genetic studies of ADHD have the potential to clarify the disorder’s
biological underpinnings, its heterogeneity, and its relationship to other neuropsychiatric diagnoses. However,
genetic research into ADHD lags in terms of: (1) sample size, (2) ancestral diversity, and (3) consideration of
phenotypic heterogeneity. Akili is designed to address all three of these critical gaps. Akili (the Swahili term for
“mind”) will enroll 6,000 children in Kenya and South Africa – 4,000 with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD and
2,000 age- and ancestry-matched controls. All participants will complete a detailed behavioral, cognitive, and
medical phenotyping battery, and provide a DNA sample. We will genetically characterize all 6,000 participants
using exome sequencing and genome-wide genotyping, and make all Akili data and materials publicly
available through the NIMH. Akili data will nearly double the number of ADHD cases available for exome
sequencing analysis and provide a 20% addition to the current PGC-ADHD GWAS activity. It will be by far the
largest contributor of diverse ancestry data to either analysis. Akili will generate a research resource of
international value, and provide the first large-scale characterization of ADHD in the African context."
10812497,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Cystic fibrosis (CF)-related diabetes mellitus (CFRD) is a major predictor of worse lung function and affects
~20% of adolescents and >40% of adults with CF. Highly effective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR) modulator therapies can improve glycemic control in patients and reduce prevalence of CFRD.
However, the follow up of the Irish ivacaftor cohort shows that FEV1 in the >18-year old group still declines after
an initial increase (not distinguishing between patients with and without CFRD). This is opposed to findings in
younger ages where FEV1 continues to rise. Since prevalence of CFRD increases with age, we wondered
whether lung function decline in the older Irish CF population on ivacaftor could be related to CFRD. In support
of this hypothesis, our CF center-specific data show that lung function decline in patients on ivacaftor with CFRD
remains worse than in patients without CFRD. Thus, it is imperative to initiate epidemiological, mechanistic, and
therapeutic studies on lung function preservation in CF patients with altered glucose control that go beyond
achieving normoglycemia and take the new era of highly effective modulators into account. We have shown that,
in CF bronchial epithelial (CFBE) cells, hyperglycemia signals through the receptor for advanced glycation end
products (RAGE or AGER), which is highly expressed in the lung and linked to the pathogenesis of chronic
inflammatory airway diseases, including CF. Activation of RAGE by hyperglycemia or the RAGE agonist high-
mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) decreases the activity of apically expressed large-conductance, Ca2+-activated,
voltage-dependent K+ (BK) channels and reduces airway surface liquid (ASL) volume. Clinically low but relevant
concentrations of metformin, approved for treating diabetes mellitus and known to block RAGE signaling,
reversed hyperglycemia-induced BK dysfunction and ASL volume depletion in CFBE cells despite the continued
presence of high glucose. Furthermore, metformin improved elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor triple combination-
mediated rescue of CFTR function and ASL volumes in CFBE cells under high glucose. Finally, continuous
monitoring of glucose levels in CF and CFRD patients over a one-week period revealed that hyperglycemic
episodes inversely correlated with mRNA expression of LRRC26, the g subunit of BK critical for its function in
non-excitable cells. We therefore hypothesize that worsening lung function in CF patients with abnormal glucose
control is associated with BK and even modulator-rescued CFTR dysfunction due to RAGE signaling and that
low dose metformin ameliorates RAGE-induced ion channel dysfunction, including CFTR in the presence of
highly effective modulators, independent of glucose control. We will test this hypothesis in mechanistic and
translational studies in vitro (Aims 1 and 2) and in vivo (Aim 3)."
10913978,"The Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) are a growing group of rare inherited diseases caused by
mutations in genes involved in protein and lipid glycosylation. Our understanding of the mechanisms driving
CDG pathogenesis remains limited, greatly impeding development of new therapies. To overcome this barrier,
our group developed and characterized a zebrafish model for the most common CDG, PMM2-CDG. PMM2-
CDG results from mutations in phosphomannomutase 2 (PMM2), which encodes an enzyme that converts
mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) to mannose-1-phosphate (M1P). Defects in PMM2 limit production of lipid-linked
N-glycosylation precursors, impairing protein glycosylation and causing numerous clinical manifestations. The
connection between individual misglycosylated proteins and disease phenotypes, however, is poorly
understood. Using the PMM2-CDG zebrafish model (pmm2m/m), we identified two classes of enzymes, the
protein proconvertases and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), as candidate drivers of pathology. Analyses of
cartilage defects in pmm2 mutant zebrafish revealed a block in early chondrocyte development that is
associated with defective processing of the cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin, and altered activity of both
MMPs and proconvertases that process N-cadherin. We will test the hypothesis that altered glycosylation
functionally impairs one or more of these enzymes, initiating a cascade of aberrant processing that prevents N-
cadherin cleavage and disrupts chondrogenesis. Parallel efforts identified multiple metabolites that are altered
in pmm2m/m embryos, including elevated levels of the polyol sorbitol. Sorbitol is increased in PMM2-CDG
patients and its level correlates with disease severity. Treatment with epalrestat, a drug under evaluation for
PMM2-CDG, reduced sorbitol levels and partially restored cartilage development in pmm2m/m embryos.
Likewise, inhibiting proconvertase activity restored some of the cartilage phenotypes, but failed to alleviate the
pronounced cellular vacuolation in pmm2m/m cartilage. These findings indicate that multiple pathogenic
mechanisms – one related to altered protease function and N-cadherin processing, another to sorbitol-driven
cellular stress – contribute to PMM2-CDG disease pathogenesis. This grant will leverage a powerful suite of
novel zebrafish tools to unravel PMM2-CDG pathogenesis at the molecular level, with the long-term goal of
broadly defining how defects in CDG genes cause disease and using this information to identify therapies. The
studies in Aim 1 will investigate the mechanisms linking altered activity of proconvertases and Mmps to
aberrant N-cadherin processing, addressing how protein-specific misglycosylation drives these phenotypes. In
Aim 2, multiple approaches will be used to modulate enzymes involved in sugar metabolism and polyol
production to define their role in PMM2-CDG cartilage pathogenesis. Aim 3 takes advantage of new zebrafish
mutants in the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex to study the relevance of these mechanisms in CDG
that disrupt other steps within the N-glycosylation pathway."
10821398,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Exercise is an important strategy to promote and maintain healthy cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and
metabolic function. However, the signals and mechanisms which transduce these effects are poorly
understood. NIH’s Director has highlighted this as a critical gap in knowledge by establishing the Common
Fund program on “Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity in Humans” to identify novel mechanisms for
exercise-induced health benefits. The long-term goal of this proposal is to examine in greater detail the factors
that regulate exercise effects on health and function, with a focus on histamine released from mast cells in
skeletal muscle. Exercise stimulates the release of histamine from mast cells in skeletal muscle, which binds to
histamine receptors and may play a role in stimulating positive adaptations. Supporting evidence is that
blocking histamine receptors during exercise influences more than 25% of exercise-responsive genes in
skeletal muscle. The histamine footprint on the exercise transcriptome crosses many cellular functions,
including vascular function, metabolism, cellular maintenance, and inflammation. However, it is not known what
triggers release of histamine from skeletal muscle during exercise, how the histamine-mediated responses
impact on health and function, or whether activation of histamine receptors is a necessary step on the path to
the positive adaptations to aerobic exercise training. These unknowns will be addressed in the following aims:
1) Identify the exercise-related signals that cause release of histamine in skeletal muscle, and 2) Determine the
broader role of histamine in longer-term adaptations to exercise training. These aims are supported by our
prior work and will be addressed using state-of-the-art methods in humans. Information from these studies will
prove valuable on three fronts. First, these studies will identify a key pathway that contributes to the health
benefits of lifetime physical activity by modulating critical signals for adaptation, filling a critical gap in
knowledge. Second, these studies will identify mechanisms (the signals for histamine release) that can be
exploited by future interventions, to mimic or enhance some of the beneficial effects of exercise. This may set
the stage for translational research with public health impact. Last, these studies may prove that histamine,
generally associated with pathophysiological responses, is an important molecular transducer of exercise
responses impacting cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, and metabolic health, enhancing our broad
understanding of the human condition. In summary, these studies will add to the understanding of histamine
and its receptors in treatment and prevention of disease associated with physical inactivity and set the stage
for new interventions targeting at-risk populations."
10834755,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this application is to test the clinical utility of a biomarker-informed approach to the evaluation and
management of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). The study is designed to address this major and
growing unmet need given the adoption of lung cancer screening in the US and abroad and the common
occurrence of incidentally identified IPNs. We have developed and validated in external cohorts a high sensitivity
hs-CYFRA 21-1 biomarker assay and quantitative imaging features that together improve the current non-
invasive assessment of IPNs. In this proposal we hypothesize that a prediction model that integrates clinical
variables, hs-CYFRA 21-1 serum concentration, and quantitative imaging signature will show clinical utility by
reducing costly and invasive procedures while shortening time to diagnosis. To test this hypothesis, we propose
the following specific aims: First, we will test the clinical utility of a biomarker-informed strategy in a first of its
kind randomized clinical trial of IPN management. We will enroll 440 individuals with intermediate risk IPNs (10-
70% risk for cancer) at four institutions with the goal of reducing the number of invasive procedures and time to
diagnosis. In the control arm, participants will follow the standard of care and in the intervention arm the
biomarker results, expressed as a post-test probability for lung cancer, will be given to providers and participants
to inform nodule management. Second, to further our work in identifying new candidate biomarkers for better
risk stratification, we will apply a workflow for evaluation of candidates and validate the best candidates for entry
into a similar future trial to that proposed in Aim 1. In a set of prospectively collected specimens, evaluated
retrospectively in a blinded fashion (ProBE design), we will test the improvement in diagnostic accuracy of
candidate biomarkers in patients with IPNs of intermediate risk for lung cancer based on the Mayo risk model. A
blood biomarker signature from Abbott laboratories will be tested alone and in combination with a validated
radiomics score to determine if together they reclassify at least 20% of those at intermediate risk (10-70%) based
on the Mayo risk model alone into either a lower risk (<10%) or higher risk (>70%) group. We will determine the
optimal and most cost-effective Mayo model + biomarker combination or sequence needed to achieve the critical
decision thresholds in the management of IPNs. At the end of this project, we will have: a) demonstrated for the
first time the clinical utility of a biomarker informed approach to IPN management and acquired additional
outcomes data for a larger follow-on randomized multicenter trial, b) validated the incremental diagnostic
accuracy of new candidate biomarkers for the management of IPNs, and c) opened a new avenue for rapid
testing of the most effective combination(s) of candidates."
10848259,"SUMMARY
Age-related osteoporosis affects millions of American men and women, and is a major cause of fractures in
those over age 50. Bone loss is due mainly to impaired bone formation, but FDA-approved agents with bone-
anabolic effects (PTH analogs and the sclerostin-neutralizing antibody romosozumab) have serious limitations.
We have found that pharmacologic or genetic stimulation of the NO/cGMP/protein kinase G (PKG) signaling
pathway enhances bone formation and prevents bone loss in diabetic and aged mice; the mechanism is through
increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling and reduced oxidative stress. Silent information regulator T1 (Sirtuin1, SIRT1)
and its substrate NAD+ decrease with age, contributing to many age-related diseases, including osteoporosis.
Osteoblast-specific Sirt1 knockout mice are osteoporotic while Sirt1 overexpressing mice have high bone mass.
We found recently that PKG activation increases SIRT1 expression in osteoblasts, mesenchymal stem cells
(MSCs), and bones of aged mice by stabilizing Sirt1 mRNA; the RNA binding protein hnRNPA1 is required.
SIRT1 is known to increase NO synthesis, possibly leading to a positive feedback loop with PKG. Supporting
positive feedback between PKG and SIRT1, we found they synergistically increase pro-survival genes in
osteoblasts and prevent oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. As part of our interest in NO/cGMP/PKG signaling,
we have developed nitrosyl-cobinamide (NO-Cbi), a NO donor that is also a strong anti-oxidant. Recent work
shows that a 10 week course of NO-Cbi improved bone formation, architecture, and strength in 24 month-old
mice. The overall goal of the proposed studies is to define the interactions between PKG and SIRT1 in bone,
and devise a novel treatment strategy for age-related osteoporosis based on PKG and SIRT1 activators. In Aim
1 we will define how PKG increases Sirt1 mRNA in MSCs and osteoblasts, focusing on PKG regulation of
hnRNPA1. In Aim 2, we will determine the consequences of PKG-SIRT1 crosstalk in bones of aged mice. We
will determine whether PKG requires SIRT1 to improve bone formation and strength by examining the effects of
PKG-activating agents on bone in conditional osteoblast-specific Sirt1 knockout mice. To determine if SIRT1-
induced NO synthesis and PKG activation is necessary for the positive effects of SIRT1 activators in bone, we
will examine the skeletal effects of these agents in mice with conditional deletion of Prkg2 in osteoblasts. In Aim
3, we will test whether combining PKG- and SIRT1-activating agents can synergistically increase bone formation
in aged mice, compared to each treatment alone. We will use NO-Cbi and the guanylyl cyclase activator
cinaciguat to activate PKG, and direct SIRT1 activators and nicotinamide riboside, a NAD+ precursor, to activate
SIRT1. The proposed work will fill important knowledge gaps, defining the role of PKG-SIRT1 crosstalk in bone
during aging and determining how PKG-SIRT1 reduce age-related oxidative stress in bone; importantly, the
proposed work lays the foundation for developing novel bone-anabolic therapies for age-related osteoporosis."
10852829,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While mortality in U.S. pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) is improving, surviving children frequently
develop persistent physical, cognitive, and psychological impairments. Over half of critically ill children
experience potentially preventable PICU-acquired morbidities, with mechanically ventilated children being at
greatest risk. In critically ill adults, randomized trials have shown that progressive mobility, started early
(within 3 days of initiating mechanical ventilation), decreases muscle weakness and the duration of
mechanical ventilation. However, similar randomized studies have not been conducted in the PICU. Our prior
studies revealed that <10% of critically ill children at the highest risk of functional decline are evaluated by a
physical or occupational therapist within 3 days of PICU admission. Given the interplay of sedation, delirium,
sleep, and immobility in the PICU, single-component interventions, such as sedation protocolization, have not
consistently shown benefit for decreasing mechanical ventilation duration. Thus, we developed the first
pediatric-specific, interprofessional intervention (PICU Up!) to integrate goal-directed sedation, delirium
prevention, sleep promotion, and family engagement into daily PICU care in order to facilitate early and
progressive mobility. We have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of this pragmatic, multifaceted strategy
in both single-site and multicenter pilot studies. Hence, the next phase of our research is to evaluate the
clinical effectiveness and delivery of the PICU Up! intervention across a range of PICU patients and health
systems.
We propose a pragmatic, stepped-wedge, cluster randomized controlled trial that will include 10 academic
and community hospitals in the United States (1,440 patients), with the following Aims: 1) Evaluate if the
PICU Up! intervention, delivered under real-world conditions, decreases mechanical ventilation duration
(primary outcome) and improves delirium and functional status compared to usual care in critically ill children;
and 2) Conduct a multi-stakeholder, mixed-methods process evaluation to identify key contextual factors
associated with delivery of PICU Up!.
If proven effective, the PICU Up! intervention has potential to profoundly change medical care in the
PICU and substantially impact public health by improving outcomes for the growing number of
pediatric survivors of critical illness."

 The goal of the Respiratory Computational Discovery Core (Core B) is to provide a collaborative infrastructure
in which experienced statisticians and computational and systems biologists will work together to support the
various PPG Projects to develop testable hypotheses about genomic features associated with COPD and IPF,
and the functional roles of these genes in disease pathogenesis. In this capacity, the Core will serve a dual role.
The Core’s analytical team will work closely with the members of the PPG Projects and Cores to design
experiments and analyze the resulting data using “conventional” methods, with an emphasis on elucidating the
functions of key genes implicated in pulmonary disease. These analyses will be augmented by the development
and application of advanced analytical methods aimed at integrating diverse types of data into an interpretable
biological framework, providing testable hypotheses regarding drivers of disease progression. The rationale
behind creating a separate Core is to supplement the strong quantitative analytical teams working on each of
the various Projects with bioinformatics and systems-based modeling expertise and to standardize and integrate
data across Projects. In addition, we will develop methods to allow us to more effectively compare results
between human and mouse model studies, facilitating the translation of laboratory results into biological and
clinical insight that will advance our understanding of the role that key genes, including those involved in
mitochondrial and chitinase processes, play in disease development and differentiate COPD and IPF."
10862725,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis are two responses of the lung to chronic cigarette smoke exposure, both of
which may be affected by mitochondrial dysfunction and chitinase pathways. Gene expression profiling has
successfully identified numerous genes involved in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); gene expression studies
in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have had more variable results. The spectrum of cellular
heterogeneity in the lung can now be assayed by single cell RNA sequencing, which has been performed in
human IPF and recently in human COPD lung tissue, serving as a comparison in an IPF study. To support all
three projects, the Molecular Characterization core will use single cell and standard RNA sequencing to test for
differences in cell types, cell subpopulations, and cell-type specific gene expression changes in COPD and IPF
in human samples collected in this PPG and in the mouse models which will be used in Projects 1 and 2. We
will address the following Specific Aims: (1) We will perform single cell RNA-sequencing in lung tissues from
murine models of bleomycin and cigarette smoke exposure to identify cellular changes associated with lung
fibrosis and airspace enlargement, respectively. We will localize cellular expression of relevant genes from all
three projects. (2) We will perform single cell RNA-sequencing in mouse lungs from the cigarette smoke-poly I:C
model to identify cellular changes associated with the combined airspace enlargement and airway fibrosis in this
model. We will localize cellular expression of relevant genes from all three projects. (3) We will perform bulk and
single cell RNA-sequencing on airway epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages collected at bronchoscopy in
the Clinical Biorepository Core. We will identify cell subpopulations and gene expression differences between
COPD, IPF, and control smokers. This new core will interact closely with Projects 1 and 2 regarding the murine

10841607,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Current nutritional strategies fail to meet the needs of very low birth weight infants, with more than half developing
malnutrition, growth failure, and other poor outcomes. Long Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (LCPUFAs) are
vital for brain and retinal development, immune function, inflammatory regulation, and health. Placental transfer
of LCPUFAs is highest in the third trimester, but this transfer abruptly stops upon premature birth. Current
nutritional strategies do not correct postnatal LCPUFA deficits. The Liver-Gut-Microbiome Axis regulates enteral
fat and fatty acid digestion, assimilation, and absorption. Gut bacteria metabolize intestinal lipids and secrete
molecules that alter lipid uptake and shape bile acid homeostasis via bile salt hydrolases and other microbial
enzymes. In turn, dietary fatty acids including LCPUFAs impact physiology both directly and by shaping gut
microbial community composition and function. It is unclear how immature gut microbiota and bile acids in VLBW
infants contribute to impaired fatty acid and LCPUFA absorption. We have shown that VLBW infants fed donor
milk have impaired growth and less alpha-diversity of gut microbiota than those fed maternal milk. We
hypothesize that impaired growth and decreased alpha-diversity is caused by the lack of intact lipase due to
pasteurization of donor milk and by impaired fatty acid absorption. We have shown that stool from cholestatic
VLBW infants with impaired growth contains less microbial bile salt hydrolase enzymatic activity, fewer
unconjugated fecal bile acids, and impaired secondary bile acid synthesis compared to VLBW infants without
cholestasis. Together, these results suggest an association between impaired fatty acid absorption, an immature
Liver-Gut-Microbiome Axis, and altered bile acid metabolism. We hypothesize that an immature Liver-Gut-
Microbiome Axis lacks key microbial bile acid modifying genes, resulting in altered bile acid composition
and impaired fatty acid and LCPUFAs absorption. Aim 1: Establish the longitudinal coefficient of fatty acid
absorption of key fatty acids in a prospective VLBW infant cohort. Coefficients of fat absorption (CFA) will be
calculated using GC-MS to measure different individual fatty acids from 72-hour dietary intakes and fecal losses.
We will use linear modeling to identify clinical determinants of CFA over time. Aim 2: Quantify relative
abundances of microbial bile acid modifying genes and activity and determine their impact on bile acid
composition and fatty acid absorption coefficients in preterm infants. Total and individual bile acid concentrations
in serum and stool from VLBW infants using MS. Microbial bile acid modifying genes will be identified in stool
using whole metagenome shotgun sequencing and gene copy numbers will be confirmed by qPCR. Bile salt
hydrolase enzyme activity will be quantified in vitro. Using state-of-the-art technologies and analytic tools, our
expert team will advance our understanding of gut microbial alterations, bile acid homeostasis, and fatty acid
absorption in VLBW infants to define novel mechanisms and future therapeutic targets to enhance nutrient
uptake and to improve fat absorption, growth, and health outcomes in VLBW infants."

In the United States, Black individuals are the group most affected by interpersonal discrimination and struc-
tural racism and older Black adults experience a disproportionate burden of chronic-pain and related disability.
Accumulating evidence suggests both interpersonal discrimination and structural racism may increase the like-
lihood of developing chronic pain and worsen chronic pain outcomes. The psychosocial and neurobiological
mechanisms through which structural racism and discrimination adversely affect chronic pain-related out-
comes, whether these pathways differ from one another, and what factors may protect against these deleteri-
ous effects, remain largely unknown. Understanding these mechanisms is critical to identifying modifiable fac-
tors that may serve as actionable intervention targets. Our central hypothesis is that structural racism (racial
residential segregation and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage) and interpersonal discrimination (di-
rect and vicarious) will adversely impact chronic pain-related outcomes via different psychosocial and neurobi-
ological pathways. The rationale for this project is that structural racism and discrimination directly impact re-
ciprocally interactive biological and psychosocial processes, promoting more rapid progression of musculoskel-
etal pain and pain-related disability among Black or African American older adults. The central hypothesis will
be tested by three specific aims: 1) Characterize the independent and combined impact of structural racism
and discrimination on chronic pain-related outcomes; 2) Test hypothesized pathways of psychosocial and bio-
logical mediators whereby structural racism and discrimination influence chronic pain-related outcomes; and 3)
Identify resilience factors that may protect against the adverse effects of structural racism and discrimination
on pain-related outcomes by either reducing the effects of racism/discrimination on psychosocial stressors, bio-
logical mechanisms, or both. Under the first aim, structural racism will be measured using racial residential
segregation (neighborhood-level Getis-Ord Gi* statistic) and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage (Area
Deprivation Index). Experiences of discrimination will include both perceived individual discrimination and vi-
carious racism. The research proposed in this application is innovative, because it investigates the individual
and combined effects of structural racism and discrimination, examines multiple biopsychosocial mechanisms,
and measures individual and community resilience. The proposed research is significant because it is ex-
pected to improve understanding of the mechanisms whereby structural racism and discrimination impact mar-
ginalized persons with chronic pain. Ultimately, this knowledge has the potential to inform multi-level interven-
tions to enhance pain outcomes in racialized and underserved peoples."
10986966,"Project Summary/Abstract
Earlier onset of a psychiatric disorder is associated with an increased likelihood of meeting criteria for
additional disorders and impaired functioning across the lifespan. Thus, efforts aimed at preventing or reducing
the development and maintenance of psychopathology early in life are of great value, especially when focused
on identifying early modifiable risk factors and mechanisms most salient to its development. The overall
objective of the present study is to investigate how the parent-child relationship across infancy and
toddlerhood – a sensitive period consisting of increased neuroplasticity and sensitivity to the quality of the
caregiving relationship – ultimately impacts the development of transdiagnostic psychopathology and its
underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. Additionally, to address the dearth of research on the importance of
fathers on children’s development, we will examine the unique contributions of both mothers and fathers in the
development of children’s psychopathology and its underlying neurocognitive mechanisms. Based on prior
theory and empirical evidence, we hypothesize that preschool executive control will be a mechanism through
which the quality of both the mother-child and father-child relationship in infancy and toddlerhood impacts the
development of the p-factor, a general shared dimension of symptoms that underlies nearly all forms of
psychopathology. To test this hypothesis, the integrative, comprehensive construct of mutually responsive
orientation (MRO) will be observed in both the mother-child and father-child relationships during infancy and
toddlerhood as predictors of child executive control in preschool and the general factor of psychopathology at
school age. MRO captures a dyadic level of relationship quality comprised of coordinated routines, harmonious
communication, mutual cooperation, and emotional ambience (high MRO) and maladaptive qualities of the
relationship such as hostile communication, lack of responsiveness, and high levels of negative affect (low
MRO). Study aims will be pursued in an established sample of 159 families (mother, father, and child) who
have completed observational paradigms when the target child was 1 and 2 years of age. Preschool executive
control will be measured using a comprehensive, laboratory battery of nine executive functioning tasks at age 5
years. Child general psychopathology will be measured using both mother and father reports of well-validated,
reliable, and developmentally appropriate psychopathology questionnaires of child internalizing problems,
externalizing problems, and emotion dysregulation when participating children turn 7 years of age. Findings are
expected to identify modifiable targets for developmentally informed prevention and intervention efforts aimed
at reducing executive dysfunction and the subsequent development of nearly all forms of psychopathology
across the lifespan."
10806974,"ABSTRACT
 Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disease most commonly caused by the Z point mutation in
the SERPINA1 gene, resulting in misfolded Z-AAT protein polymerization in hepatocytes, cell death, and often
cirrhosis. Replacement of ZZ with wild type MM hepatocytes via liver transplantation is the only available cure
for AATD liver disease. However, organs for transplant are in short supply and transplantation comes with risk
of graft rejection. Hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs), derived from AATD patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)
after gene editing of the Z mutation, could provide an unlimited supply of autologous M-AAT producing cells for
transplantation without the burden of rejection. Yet, poor engraftment of HLCs remains a critical gap that
must be addressed before iPSC-based therapy can be made available to AATD patients suffering from
severe liver disease.
 The goal of this proposal is to fill this gap by promoting iPSC-derived HLC survival, proliferation and
maturation, key features for cell engraftment, to treat the AATD associated liver disease of the NSG-PiZ
transgenic mouse model. To do so, we will employ AATD patient-specific iPSCs that have been gene edited
from ZZ to MM. These MM iPSCs will be engineered to make MM HLCs that express physiological levels of the
2 key known hepatocyte mitogen receptors, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor, cMET, and epidermal
growth factor (EGF) receptor, EGFR, as well as 3 transcription factors known to be critical for hepatocyte
maturation, ATF5, PROX1, and CEBPA, using a timely controlled doxycycline inducible piggyBac transposon
system. The receptors, cMET and EGFR, will be activated using the corresponding ligands, HGF and EGF,
delivered via intravenous injection of nucleoside-modified mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles (mRNA-
LNP), a non-integrative and safe technology that our lab has recently established to treat various liver diseases.
Our preliminary data support the feasibility of this project and are summarized as follows: (1) We have built the
transcriptional units of the doxycycline-inducible piggyBac platform, and we expect to complete the platform and
start engineering hiPSC lines when the award will be initiated; (2) We showed that diseased hepatocytes in NSG-
PiZ mice are efficiently transfected with mRNA-LNPs, validating the mRNA-LNP tool to deliver mitogens in the
liver of these mice; (3) We showed that HGF+EGF mRNA-LNP treatment enhances transplanted control primary
human hepatocyte engraftment and also improves, albeit transiently, HLC survival after transplantation into
NSG-PiZ mice. This leaves room for improvement, the goal of the present application. Thus, our central
hypothesis is: Activation of the mitogen HGF/cMET and EGF/EGFR axes in combination with expression of 3
key hepatocyte maturation factors ATF5, PROX1, and CEBPA will lead to successful HLC therapy for AATD
liver disease. Importantly, this project will pioneer the use of mRNA-LNPs, which have been widely validated as
safe with the recent mRNA-based vaccines, to harness HLC-based liver therapy for AATD patients."

Congenital defects of the eye occur in approximately 5 per 10,000 live births. While there is a paucity of
epidemiologic information about these conditions, there is a growing awareness of the long-term complications
among children with these malformations. Among the more common visually threatening congenital eye
defects are anophthalmia (total absence of the globe); microphthalmia (anomalously small eye in the orbit);
and coloboma (failure of the closure of the fetal fissure). Collectively, these defects are referred to as MAC
complex and are considered part of an embryologic continuum of ocular malformations. Although MAC
accounts for approximately 12% of permanent blindness, epidemiologic studies have provided few insights into
the causes of these conditions. While genetic studies have been more fruitful, in clinical series, the known
MAC-related genes account for less than half of cases and there are no population-based estimates of the
proportion of MAC cases attributable to genetic mutations. Thus, our understanding of the genetics of MAC
remains incomplete and there are likely to be additional, as yet, unidentified MAC genes. In addition, there
have been few efforts to systematically characterize affected individuals with respect to co-occurring
phenotypes (herein termed “deep phenotyping”), which could provide insights into the underlying etiologies of
these conditions, define genotype-phenotype correlations, and ultimately inform precision medicine efforts. Our
long-term goal is to improve prevention efforts for and clinical management of MAC. The objectives of the
current study are to 1) better define the MAC phenotype and 2) characterize the role of known and newly
identified pathogenic genetic variants that confer MAC susceptibility. We will leverage the resources of the
Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR), which is one of the world's largest population-based birth defects
surveillance systems that has actively monitored births throughout the state since 1999. Additionally, we will
utilize the resources of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center to comprehensively phenotype
cases with MAC, and the National Eye Institute (NEI) Ophthalmic Genomics Laboratory to identify genetic
variants underlying MAC phenotypes. Our multidisciplinary team of epidemiologists, ophthalmologists, and
geneticists has an established track-record in MAC research and is uniquely poised to reach our objectives
through completion of the following Aims: 1) Define the phenotypic spectrum of children diagnosed with MAC
and determine the prevalence of pathogenic variants in known and suspected MAC-related genes; 2) Conduct
deep phenotyping of individuals with MAC and their first-degree relatives; and 3) Discover novel MAC-related
genes among individuals without known pathogenic variants. This study will be the first to comprehensively
characterize the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum on a population-based sample of children living with MAC.
Results from this study will inform genetic testing, counseling, treatment, and disease surveillance strategies
for these individuals with MAC."

represented Region 1 of the leDEA initiative since 2006. The 23 single and multi-site clinical and
classical epidemiologic HIV cohorts of the NA-ACCORD encompass most HIV cohorts within the
US and Canada. Over 100 sites contribute data collected from over 190,000 people with HIV
(PWH). We have established a strong collaborative infrastructure that capitalizes on the talents
and expertise of a multi-disciplinary group of investigators that span basic science, clinical
research, epidemiology, data informatics and biostatistics. We have been highly productive in
addressing our previous Aims and key questions in contemporary care and public health relevant
to adult PWH. Our strengths are especially relevant to the goals of the US DHHS Ending the HIV
Epidemic (EHE) initiative, uniquely providing the broad geographic and demographic scope,
established scientific platform, large sample size, extensive longitudinal follow-up of >1.3 million
person-years, and depth of clinical data to inform the goals of EHE with rich data on those who will
continue to survive with HIV after transmission is halted. With the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic, questions regarding the impact of COVID-19 on HIV outcomes and trends in HIV
indicators, as well as longer-term outcomes of COVID-19 among PWH, can be answered in the
NA-ACCORD. Within this context, we present three broadly-defined aims for the next funding
cycle: Aim 1: Characterize the longitudinal course of HIV treatment, progression and outcomes in
North America in the setting of the EHE initiative, which will increase the number and heterogeneity
of those in HIV care as HIV treatment and the long-term challenges of living with HIV continue to
evolve. Aim 2: To assess and characterize the clinical course of HIV infection in North America,
with a focus on major non-AIDS comorbidities and co-infections, multimorbidity and comorbidity-
free life expectancy. Aim 3: To expand and extend our state-of-the art epidemiologic, biostatistical,
and data science methodologic approaches. The NA-ACCORD is a world-class collaboration of
established HIV cohorts well-positioned to a) provide in-depth understanding of the longitudinal
course of HIV when extraordinary efforts are being made to EHE; b) collaborate with the other
IeDEA regions to inform the future HIV epidemics in low- and middle-income regions; and c)
understand differences in HIV treatment, outcomes and prognostic factors that will inform future

Explore the Chemistry and Chemical Biology of Reactive Sulfur Species
 Reactive sulfur species (RSS) include hydrogen sulfide (H2S), persulfides (RSSH),
polysulfides (H2Sn or RSSnR, n≥2), and cysteine-modified adducts like S-nitrosothiols (SNO). These
species play regulatory roles in redox biology. They are both indicators and effectors of disease
states, simultaneously offering diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. However, the exact
mechanisms of action of many RSS are still unclear. A number of fundamental questions concerning
the chemistry of these species must be addressed before we can expect a biological understanding
and clinical applications. Our lab has discovered some interesting chemistry and reactions of RSS.
We have also developed a variety of chemical tools that can be used to further their biological studies.
In this R35 application we plan to continue our efforts on exploring the chemistry and chemical biology
of reactive sulfur species. We propose four distinct research directions for the next five years: 1) to
explore novel H2S/RSS donors and dual donors, and to study the applications of these compounds; 2)
to study the reactions of persulfides and polysulfides, and to investigate mechanisms of protein S-
modifications caused by persulfide donors; 3) to explore novel H2S scavenging systems and their
applications; 4) to develop the next generation of xanthene-based fluorescent dyes and RSS sensors.
The completion of this project will allow us to better understand the properties and biological
significance of these sulfur species. It will also provide novel research tools that can be used in both
basic and translational biomedical research on RSS."

The University of Kentucky Center for Appalachian Research in Environmental Sciences (UK-CARES) will
build on our early successes, capitalize on lessons learned, and enhance our mission through a dual focus on
better understanding exposure pathways and emerging environmental health threats and optimizing research
translation. Our Mission is to focus on exposure pathways to better match with community concerns and to
emphasize research translation. Our Values reflect strong, multidirectional community-academic partnerships,
with a renewed commitment to meaningful processes, procedures, and policies that respect and promote
diversity, equity, and inclusivity. Responsible conduct of research is at the foundation of our Center,
appreciating the essential value of rigorous and reproducible multidisciplinary team science. Our goals are to
(a) advance multidisciplinary environmental health science (EHS); (b) analyze organic contaminants and trace-
elements; (c) cultivate early-stage stage and established investigators; (d) learn with and from the community,
helping to inform and translate our research; and (e) build science communication skills with investigators and
community partners to boost research translation. We will advance EHS across the translational spectrum
around three highly integrated science themes informed by residents of rural Appalachia: 1) Health Impacts of
Waterborne Contaminants (WATER); 2) Health Impacts of Indoor and Outdoor Airborne Contaminants (AIR);
and 3) Emerging Environmental Health Threats (EMERGING THREATS). The central hypothesis is that
exposure to established contaminants via environmental exposure pathways (e.g., water, air) and emerging
environmental health threats, combined with lifestyle and societal risk factors, contributes to the
disproportionately high incidence of chronic diseases and health disparities in rural Appalachia. UK-CARES
draws on a strong and diverse base of EHS and community-engaged research to meet the needs of
communities in rural Appalachia. We will support and mentor investigators so they can reach the translational
milestones in research: (1) asking fundamental questions; (2) applying and synthesizing; (3) implementing and
adjusting; (4) moving ideas to practice; and (5) creating impact. In short, UK-CARES will leverage its resources
to enhance EHS at UK while also reducing health risks and disparities in rural Appalachia. An Integrated
Health Sciences Facility Core, Analytical Chemistry Core for Environmental Sciences, and Community
Engagement Core are integral to this effort, as these cores will provide dedicated support in analytical
chemistry, trace-elements analysis, biospecimen management, and bioinformatics and bridge Center and
community priorities. The Pilot Project Program supports developing research and new scientific directions,
advancing the careers of scientists interested in tackling challenging environmental health questions. UK-
CARES will positively impact rural Appalachia through collaborative EHS designed to generate and
disseminate new knowledge and translate research to inform clinical decision making and policy development."
10844550,"ABSTRACT
Hundreds of thousands of mutations have been identified in cancer. However, the vast majority of cancer
mutations lack functional biological characterization. Therefore, very little is known about their impact on gene
function beyond in silico predictions. Developing experimental models to study the biological consequences of
these mutations is a daunting challenge. We developed a technology called transcript-informed single cell
CRISPR sequencing (TISCC-seq) that provides modeling of cancer mutations at single cell resolution. CRISPR
engineering introduces cancer gene mutations into cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a power
tool for evaluating the genomic features of cancer. By combining these two approaches TISCC-seq has the
potential for dramatic increases in parallelization and scalability of experimental cancer models. We use DNA
base editors to introduce specific cancer mutations into target genes among individual cells. Single molecule
nanopore sequencing of the cDNA target directly identifies the mutation in each cell. By integrating single cell
long and short read sequence data, each cell’s newly introduced mutation is matched to the same cell’s gene
expression data. We will develop TISCC-seq as a new single cell genomic platform for engineering cancer
mutations into cell lines and primary tissue cultures.
 Single base mutations are the most commonly reported type of cancer genetic alteration. For Aim 1, we will
develop TISCC-seq for highly multiplexed functional screening of substitution mutations at single cell resolution
while matching the mutation genotype to the same single cell’s transcriptome. We will identify reported cancer
mutations with known biological effects and others which are not characterized identified in colorectal or gastric
cancer. Next, we will determine which of these mutations can be engineered using base editing methods. Then,
we will deliver base editors and guide RNAs to engineer up to 500 substitution mutations across different cell
lines and organoids. Post-editing, the cells will undergo scRNA-seq with both short and long-read platform.
These data sets will be integrated to provide a single readout where the single cell mutation is matched to the
corresponding cell’s gene expression.
 Alternative splicing is increasingly recognized as an important feature of cancer. Some cis-based cancer
mutations occur in exon-intron junctions that lead to alternative splicing of mRNAs. For Aim 2, we will develop
TISCC-seq as a method to evaluate this category of mutations. First, we will identify a set of 100 cancer genes
that have cis-based mutations at exon-intron junctions as reported in colorectal or gastric cancer. We will
increase the scalability of this process such that at least 500 of this class of mutations can be studied in parallel
using an integrated long and short read sequencing. These mutations will be introduced across different cell
lines and organoids. Overall, we will develop a new CRISPR genomic technology for highly multiplexed modeling
of cancer mutations at single cell resolution and studying their biological effects."
10886146,"Here we will identify nonhuman primate (NHP) neuron types and build an extensive toolbox of vectors for circuit-
based neuroscience studies. NHPs share substantial neuroanatomical, genetic, and behavioral homology with
humans, and therefore they are indispensable for investigating the neural circuit basis of cognition and devising
therapies to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders. Despite the importance of NHPs, we lack the tools to
analyze and manipulate complex circuits in the primate brain. This lack severely limits the use of genetically-
coded neuroscience tools to examine circuit specific functions and hinders development of targeted gene
therapeutics. Current methods for achieving transgenesis in small model species, such as the creation of
genetically modified strains, are prohibitively expensive in NHP and not applicable to human disease. AAVs are
the leading alternative to germline modification and selective breeding. AAVs infect adult neurons, confer stable
transgene expression, and have proven safe in gene therapy clinical trials. AAVs do not have natural cell-types
specific properties, but when altered or combined with cell type specific regulatory sequences
(enhancers/promoters) they have been able to achieve cell type-specific transgenesis. This has made possible,
for example, our previous optogenetic investigation of midbrain dopamine neurons for learning and decision
making. However, before AAV-mediated gene delivery can be generalized to circuits across the brain and for
multiple behavioral functions, we must create currently lacking vectors and promoters that permit efficient and
specific gene delivery to all required cell types. Here, we will combine single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) with
high-throughput screening of engineered adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to create a complete toolbox of viral
vectors and promoters enabling minimally invasive monitoring and manipulation of neurons in NHP brain. We
have devised a transdisciplinary approach to classify individual neurons according to their gene expression
profile and simultaneously screen for adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors (capsids and regulatory sequences)
capable of specific and efficient transgene delivery to classified neurons. First, we will synthesize massive
libraries of mutated AAV vectors and synthetic promoters, in which each variant is paired with a unique DNA
barcode. We will then scRNA-Seq to capture the transcriptome for each cell and quantify the AAV and promoter-
specific barcodes in every cell’s expression profile. Preliminary experiments in Rhesus monkeys have fully
validated and demonstrated the promise of this innovative approach. The outcomes of our Specific Aims will
include (1) an inventory of cell types in the retina, prefrontal cortex, primary motor cortex, and striatum, (2) cell
type-specific AAVs and promoters targeting all defined cell types, (3) AAVs with broad tropisms, (4) a publicly
available dataset of transcription profiles for millions of NHP brain cells, (5) an updated and comprehensive
Rhesus macaque reference genome, and (6) anatomical, physiological, and functional validation of cell type-
specific circuits tools and their function in the NHP brain."
10783786,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this proposal we aim to identify gene regulatory elements that permit the targeting and manipulation of brain
circuit models of human brain function. Gaining genetic access to specific neuron populations in nontransgenic
animals and humans would enable targeted circuit modulation for hypothesis testing and provide a means to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of circuit modulation for the treatment of epilepsy and psychiatric disorders. Our
approach capitalizes on our combined expertise in the development and maturation of brain cell-types and
circuits (Gord Fishell), identification of CIS-regulatory elements that function across species (Jordane
Dimidschstein) and AAV engineering combined with large-scale screening methods (Ben Deverman). Our efforts
will benefit from an ongoing collaboration with John Reynolds at the Salk Institute on observation and
manipulation of cortical circuits during complex visual perception tasks. This project will build upon success that
we and others have had in identifying gene regulatory elements that enable cell type-restricted gene expression
when used within recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. Identifying additional enhancer sequences
that function in the context of the limited carrying capacity of AAV has been slow due to the limited success rate
and low throughput nature of these efforts. Here we aim to apply a novel high-throughput screening approach
for the rapid identification of a suite of enhancers that enable the study and manipulation of genetically defined
cell types and circuits across species. Our preliminary data demonstrates that our enhancer identification
strategy can yield novel and highly specific enhancers that restrict expression to target populations. In addition,
we have demonstrated that it is possible to use the engineered AAV-PHP.eB capsid to screen enhancers across
the brain with a single noninvasive injection. These successes have highlighted the need for more rapid and
comprehensive assessment of putative enhancers. In the UH3 portion of this proposal we will examine the
tolerance to neuronal activity manipulation within the target neuronal populations in several species. We will also
apply the AAV-enhancer viruses for querying disease-related circuits using Rabies tracing in conjunction with
optogenetics. This proposal will be transformative in devising methods to target and manipulate the brain activity
of specific neuronal cell populations across species, including human cell-derived organoids."
10844514,"Abscesses are infected walled-off fluid collections of pus and bacteria and represent a
ubiquitous global healthcare problem. They are common sequelae of surgery, infections,
or disease, and can affect any part of the body. Current standard of care includes
hospitalization, antibiotics, and drainage of the abscess with a catheter. The bacteria in
pus are susceptible mechanical damage with High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU),
which generates localized cavitation and is a potential noninvasive means to treat
abscesses. The significance of this proposal is that treatment of abscesses using
ultrasound therapy under ultrasound guidance is better for the patient because it is
minimally- or non-invasive, has less procedural pain, doesn’t require that the patient live
for up to several weeks with a drain inserted, requires no catheter management, there is
no potential tract for new infections, and no need for CT/fluoro imaging radiation.
Furthermore, ultrasound treatment will reduce the need for antibiotics, and thus reduce
the potential for drug resistant, life-threatening microbes."

According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology, in the year 2020, stomach cancer caused death of
768,793 patients worldwide making it the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths. H. pylori infection is the
strongest risk factor for gastric cancer. H. pylori-initiated inflammation leads to atrophic gastritis, spasmolytic
polypeptide expressing metaplasia (SPEM), gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM) and dysplasia, a series of
preneoplastic lesions strongly associated with gastric cancer. The eradication of H. pylori by antibiotic treatment
has been effective in reducing the incidence of preneoplastic lesions and gastric cancer. However, following H.
pylori eradication already established mucosal metaplastic changes may not reverse, and the risk of gastric
cancer in such patients remains high. A better understanding of the mechanisms contributing to inflammation
and the resulting preneoplastic lesions is required to develop rational and effective therapies. One of the
mechanisms by which H. pylori stimulates inflammatory signaling and preneoplastic lesions is by disrupting the
communication between the gastric epithelium and the surrounding mesenchyme/stroma. We have identified a
novel role of PKA activation in the gastric mesenchyme in establishing a proinflammatory and preneoplastic state
that is associated with downregulation of BMP signaling which is known to be a key regulator of gastric
inflammation and preneoplasia. We generated and characterized a novel conditional mutant mouse Six2Cre+/--
PKAcRfl/wt (CA-PKA) model in which single allele-mediated expression of constitutively active PKA (PKAcR)
was induced in the stomach mesenchyme using Six2-Cre transgenic mice. CA-PKA Mice develop preneoplastic
lesions such as atrophic gastritis, SPEM, GIM and dysplasia along with marked chronic inflammation, factors
strongly associated with gastric cancer The central hypothesis of this proposal is that PKA activation in the gastric
mesenchyme is a key driver of gastric carcinogenesis by inciting inflammation and inhibiting BMP signaling that
will be tested in the following three aims. Aim 1 is to determine the mechanisms that contribute to inflammation
and oxyntic atrophy in CA-PKA mice. Aim 2 is to determine the effects of genetic modulation of BMP pathway
inhibitor gremlin 1 (Grem1) on the severity of gastric preneoplastic lesions in CA-PKA mice. Aim 3 is to determine
the impact of misregulated PKA signaling on H. felis-induced gastric pathology. Expected outcomes of the
proposed research will define the molecular and functional significance of mis-regulated PKA signaling in
disrupting gastric homeostasis and driving pathology. A better understanding of misregulated PKA signaling as
an underlying cause of gastric inflammation and preneoplasia can help develop preventative and treatment
strategies for gastric cancer and associated pathological conditions."

10932107,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hispanic cancer patients and survivors face social and structural inequalities perpetuating mental health
disparities. Despite these challenges, the study team and community partners are convinced that psychosocial
and mental health inequities perpetrated by socio-environmental factors can be overcome through community-
based multilevel interventions; yet none currently exist. This project is highly transformative and innovative
because it disrupts traditional psycho-oncology mental health care to address upstream structural (limited access
to psychosocial and mental health inequities and psychological distress screening), social (mental health
stigma), and biological (stress and inflammation biomarkers) determinants of mental health among Hispanic
cancer patients and survivors. This transformation will be achieved by simultaneously integrating grassroots
(community leaders) and top-down (institutional) resources to increase access to specialized psycho-oncology
mental health care services and psychological distress screening while eradicating mental health stigma. First,
the team will train lay community leaders to become community health workers addressing psycho-oncology
mental health prevention efforts. Second, the investigators, along with community stakeholders, will package the
proposed multilevel community-based intervention by integrating and adapting a suite of individual/community
interventions and service initiatives previously developed and implemented by members of the research team
and proven to positively impact Puerto Rican Hispanic cancer patients and survivors’ psychosocial and mental
health wellbeing. At the community level, the team will first train lay community leaders to become community
mental health workers through the PHSU-RCMI Community Training Institute for Health Disparities. At the
interpersonal level, the community-based intervention will integrate family-communications skills to impact
Hispanic cancer patients' and survivor family caregivers’ support quality. At the individual level, the intervention
will impact all phases of the mental health prevention continuum to prevent and address psychological distress
resulting from cancer and its treatment. At the biological level, investigators will assess the effect of the
community intervention on psychological stress biomarkers (cortisol and catecholamine metabolites) and
inflammation markers (cytokines and chemokines) related to chronic stress and cancer health outcomes. The
team anticipates this project will push a transformative population-level impact through a multilevel approach
that empowers communities to understand and address mental health among individuals."

comprehensive program of mentoring, research experiences, conferences, workshops, and seminars, U-
RISE at UVI will provide trainees with biomedical research training and a clear pathway to obtaining their
PhD. The goals are that the program will: (1) provide students with a rigorous curriculum that develops both
verbal and quantitative skills, (2) provide research training opportunities through extramural summer research
experiences and academic year experiences that prepare trainees to produce high quality scientific work, (3)
provide students with a clearly articulated career pathway for admission to highly selective research
universities and a structure for success, (4) develop strong partnerships with research-intensive institutions,
including T32 funded programs, (5) develop strong professional networks for UVI students and faculty, and
(6) provide URISE students with effective mentoring on multiple levels (including near-peer mentors,
academic mentors, and research mentors). To achieve these goals, some of the program’s measurable
objectives include: (1) 100% of URISE trainees will graduate, (2) at least 30% of the students producing
exceptionally high-quality work (for example, having an abstract accepted at disciplinary meeting), (3)
mentors and mentees will report spending productive time together each semester, (4) mentors and mentees
will produce products from their work, such as conference presentations and published journal articles (5)
95% of URISE students apply to doctoral programs by November 30 of their senior year, (6) 65% of trainees
will enroll in doctoral programs within three years of graduation, and (7) 60% of trainees will complete higher
degree programs. These objectives will be accomplished with a program that builds on past success and
includes new curricular modules and workshops, extramural research, presentations at conferences, visiting
scientists, and a network of support for trainees. U-RISE at UVI has designed a program that combines highly
competitive partners and exciting new initiatives at UVI to continue to improve its historical record of
producing minority PhDs."

This is an application for renewal of a highly successful, competitive and comprehensive institutional
postdoctoral training program in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) that has been in
place at Vanderbilt University since 2003. The 30 preceptor faculty comprise an experienced and expert group
of research scientists engaged in the development and application of MR methods in several different
important research areas and across different scales. MR methods serve not only as the single most important
modality in diagnostic imaging but also provide crucial insights into biological processes and structure to
address fundamental questions in biomedical research. There are continuing advances in MR technology, but
there is a shortage and a critical need for appropriately trained scientists capable of fully exploiting the potential
of MR techniques. We have developed a comprehensive training program in biomedical MRI and MRS
designed for outstanding postdoctoral scientists from different backgrounds. Some have been exposed to
imaging and MR methods before, but others have had little previous significant experience in biomedical MRI
and MRS. Postdoctoral trainees from physics, chemistry, biology, engineering or medicine may receive
thorough and exemplary instruction in all of the cognate areas relevant to biomedical NMR in a coherent and
comprehensive program. In addition, trainees pursue research in MR methods and applications (mainly) in
neuroscience, radiology, cancer and metabolic disorders and are co-mentored by collaborators from relevant
clinical departments. Our program continues to evolve and in this renewal several notable enhancements are
described. The formal training includes an educational program, consisting of courses, seminars, and journal
clubs; a practical program, consisting of faculty-led tutorials and practical training; and a research program, in
which trainees are integrated into an active research program. These programs illustrate most major aspects of
the applications of MR methods in humans and animals. Trainees have access to outstanding facilities
including three research-dedicated human MR systems (2 at 3T and one 7T); animal MR systems at 4.7T, 7T,
9.4T and 15.2T; and other imaging modalities. Trainees are also mentored in the ethics and methods of
biomedical research, in rigor and reproducibility, as well as in grant writing and other important career skills.
Our previous trainees have been very successful in their careers after leaving our program. Of 50 trainees to
date, 20 are now faculty at major research universities, 12 continue as research fellows or research scientists
in medical centers, 3 work in MR-related industries, 5 are engaged in biomedical administration or government
positions, 2 are physicians, 6 are still in training, one died and and one is no longer able to work. The
programs, personnel, and facilities at Vanderbilt provide outstanding opportunities for training in biomedical
NMR of the highest caliber, and will ensure the remarkable insights into biology and disease made possible
with MRI and MRS will be realized."
10795652,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 In order to efficiently control energy homeostasis, the brain makes predictions about future
caloric needs and food availability in order to invigorate food-seeking behavior. It is well
established that dopamine neurons play a crucial role in this process, as they communicate
prediction error signals to central reward centers, such as the nucleus accumbens. This process
reinforces learning and aids in the development of reward-seeking behavior in response to
environmental cues. Dopamine release in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) - a primary
homeostatic control center, has been reported. However, it is unknown if dopamine in LHA
encodes prediction errors to guide food-seeking behavior. Further, the source of LHA dopamine
is currently unknown. In this proposal we aim to characterize the role of dopamine in LHA and
test the hypothesis that LHA receives prediction error signals from dopamine neurons in the
ventral tegmental area. The experiments in this proposal will reveal a novel neural circuit and
define a new role for dopamine in feeding behavior."
10954345,"Project Summary
End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients must maintain chronic vascular access to perform life-saving
hemodialysis (HD); however, the HD access portal is extremely vulnerable to infection, stenosis, and thrombo-
occlusion. While vascular access options include the placement of central veinous catheters, arteriovenous
(AV) fistulas, and AV grafts, superior outcomes have been established with the use of AV fistulas (AVFs).
Despite national vascular access guidelines promoting the use of AVFs over synthetic arteriovenous grafts
(AVGs) for dialysis due to their lower occlusion rates and longer survival, AVGs are still utilized in ~17% of all
chronic HD patients (~85,000 in the U.S.). Regrettably, significant healthcare disparities exist within this patient
population. Indeed, in chronic HD patients, the rate of AVG use is 77% higher in the Black/African American
versus white population, while AVG use among females is 69% greater than in males. Thus, an important
unmet need exists to address AVG patency and longevity. This SBIR Fast-Track project directly addresses the
critical need by developing a unique antithrombotic agent, AB023 (xisomab 3G3), to help maintain chronic
AVG access patency. To this end, we have recently completed a single-dose pilot phase 2a clinical trial
(NCT03963895) in ESRD patients to evaluate whether this approach may be safe and effective. Our early
clinical data suggests that xisomab 3G3 is indeed safe in this medically complex patient population, with no
drug-related adverse events and no increased bleeding observed at the vascular access site (Lorentz, et. al.
Blood, 2021). A single dose of xisomab 3G3 limited systemic markers of both thrombosis and inflammation,
and also reduced severe dialysis circuit blood clotting events. During this proposed Phase I/II SBIR project, we
propose to extend these studies into repeat, every other week drug administration to determine if this new
approach to anticoagulation is safe and effective in chronic HD patients with AVGs, who generally have an
elevated risk of both thrombosis and bleeding and no satisfactory options for therapeutic anticoagulation. Since
xisomab 3G3 specifically targets coagulation factor XI (FXI) activation by factor XII (FXII) without inhibiting the
FXI feedback activation by thrombin, our innovative drug candidate is entirely unique in the growing
armamentarium of FXI inhibitors under development. Accordingly, since FXII deficiency in humans does not
result in any known bleeding side-effects, xisomab 3G3 could be an effective antithrombotic strategy that is
exceptionally safe. As such, xisomab 3G3 represents a fundamentally unique anticoagulation concept.
Success of the proposed research and achievement of our critical milestones will lead directly to subsequent
and definitive safety/efficacy trials in ESRD patients with chronically implanted AVGs, who are in desperate
need of safe thromboprophylaxis."
11000656,"Summary: Elevated ambient ozone levels are associated with increased hospitalizations due to respiratory
problems in children, the elderly, and patients with pre-existing muco-obstructive airway diseases. Patients with
muco-obstructive airway diseases frequently encounter ozone pollution-induced exacerbations with marked
overproduction of mucus and mucoobstruction. These features lead to the worsening of clinical symptoms and
further decline in lung functions. However, the mechanistic understanding of the initiation and progression of
mucous cell metaplasia (MCM) in ozone-stressed respiratory epithelium remains unexplored. Lack of such
knowledge is a major obstacle in the development of effective therapeutic strategies against ozone-exacerbated
muco-obstructive airway diseases. Our published and preliminary data reveal interesting relationship between
ozone and MCM. First, repetitive ozone exposure results in MCM in healthy mice. Second, repetitive ozone
exposure exaggerates MCM and mucoobstructive phenotype in mice with ongoing chronic bronchitis-like lung
disease. These findings suggest that ozone-induced exacerbations of pulmonary symptoms in muco-obstructive
patients are contributed, in part, by exaggerated MCM and associated defects in the functioning of the
mucociliary escalator. Our preliminary data demonstrate that while the mRNA expression of Il4ra receptor and
the secretory levels of its ligand, IL-13, were significantly upregulated in the airways of sub-chronically (3-week)
ozone-exposed mice, the mRNA expression of Egfr and its ligands, i.e., Tgfa, were significantly downregulated.
These data indicate differential regulation of EGFR and IL4R signaling pathways in ozone-induced MCM.
Therefore, it is important to mechanistically test the role of EGFR- versus IL4R-regulated pathways in ozone-
exposed model of MCM. Accordingly, our central hypothesis is that ozone-induced MCM is independent of EGFR
signaling but dependent upon IL4R signaling that regulates the transdifferentiation of airway epithelial cells to
mucous cells. The specific aims are: Aim 1: To delineate MCM transdifferentiation pathway and to profile
molecular and cellular changes associated with MCM in ozone-exposed murine airways. In this aim, we will
profile cellular and molecular changes associated with MCM in the nasal and lower airways of ozone-exposed
mice. Aim 2: Determine the role of basal- versus epithelial cell-specific EGFR and IL4R in MCM. Basal cell-
and airway epithelial cell-specific EGFR- and IL4R-deficient mice will be used to study the role of their ligands
in ozone-induced MCM. The findings from our studies will enhance our mechanistic understanding of the
molecular pathways involved in MCM. Eventually, these findings may be applied towards the development of
therapeutics against air pollution-induced MCM."
10767300,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly 20 million adults (38%) aged 65 and older have limitations with one or more self-care activities (e.g.,
dressing, getting out of bed) and one in ten older adults are living with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related
Dementias (ADRD). Together these two overlapping groups of “high-need” older adults typically rely on a
variety of long-term care (LTC) sources to assist with daily activities, including family and unpaid care, paid
care in the home, residential care such as assisted living and nursing home care. Inadequate care may lead to
adverse consequences in daily self-care and avoidable health care utilization. The sudden onset of the COVID-
19 pandemic may have profoundly affected access to and use of LTC and contributed to further adverse
consequences for high-need older adults, particularly for those living with ADRD. This project will draw upon
two complementary longitudinal, nationally representative surveys of older adults–the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS) and the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS)–linked to geographic data and
Medicare claims. Using statistical approaches that strengthen our ability to draw causal inferences, we will: 1)
Evaluate the short-term impact (2018-2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic on the type and amount of LTC use,
comparing high-need older adults with and without ADRD and identify arrangements more likely to be “stable”
with lower risks of change. 2) Determine whether care trajectories were disrupted after the start of the
pandemic, comparing high-need older adults with and without ADRD from 2016 through 2024/2025. 3) Assess
the impact of COVID-19 on adverse consequences related to care gaps among high-need older adults with
and without ADRD. We will estimate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on self-reports of unmet need (using
NHATS) and claims-based measures of avoidable hospitalizations and emergency department visits (using
HRS) for those with and without ADRD. Detailed geographic data will allow us to take into account local
conditions while identifying more “vulnerable” care arrangements with higher risks of adverse consequences.
The results of this project will provide a comprehensive understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on
LTC outcomes in the short and longer term. This study aligns with NIA’s priority to understand community
support for dementia care, in particular the determinants of availability LTC, LTC utilization and how the effects
of community level factors including infrastructure and risk environment."
10766713,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Identifying just one new clinical candidate for the treatment of human disease usually requires the design,
synthesis, testing, and redesign of thousands upon thousands of organic compounds. Improvements to synthetic
technologies therefore have a major impact on the time required to identify clinical candidates by maximizing the
number of compounds that can be accessed from a single precursor. In particular, adjusting key properties such
as bioactivity, solubility, metabolism, and stability are best accomplished by methods that are capable of
preparing a wide variety of new compounds with a minimal number of steps. Late-stage functionalization of
carbon-hydrogen bonds offers medicinal chemists this coveted opportunity by facilitating the introduction of
numerous types of functional groups into a given lead structure. Recent efforts have demonstrated that transition-
metal catalysts can enable the diverse functionalization of strong alkyl C–H bonds within organic compounds via
the intermediacy of an organoboron compound. However, methods to achieve control over the site- and
stereoselectivity of alkyl C–H bond functionalization are limited by their strength and ubiquity in complex
molecules. The proposed research focuses on the development of a broadly applicable strategy to achieve
selectivity in the functionalization of C(sp3)–H bonds that is independent of inherent substrate preferences. The
impact of this work is to enable practitioners to make precise structural edits to bioactive compounds without
lengthy synthetic manipulation. The proposed approach converts a major challenge in complex molecule
functionalization, the presence of potentially intervening groups, into an opportunity to localize reactivity of a
transition metal catalyst to convert specific C–H bonds into C–B bonds. Specifically, the proposed research will
create catalysts and reagents that bind an existing polar functional group, such an alcohol or amide, thereby
guiding functionalization to an adjacent site. Synthetic routes are presented to access a suite of catalysts and
reagents. In conjunction with experiments to evaluate their suitably for guided functionalization, they will be
refined iteratively for application to target structures. Subsequent studies of the functionalization of complex,
biologically active compounds will demonstrate the applicability and generality of the proposed method to lead
optimization. To control stereoselectivity, a key consideration in alkyl C–H bond functionalization, chiral diborane
reagents derived from readily available precursors will be employed. By differentiating the energies of
diastereomeric intermediates and transition states en route to the alkylboronate products, new derivatives can
be accessed with well-defined three-dimensional structures. An integrated component of the proposed research
program are mechanistic experiments that will form the basis of informed improvements to the overall approach,
as defined by metrics that include reaction efficiency, site-selectivity, and stereo-selectivity. Achieving the
specific aims of the proposed research will expand the opportunities available to scientists to make precise edits
to complex organic compounds at alkyl C–H bonds, facilitating access to new bioactive compounds."
10748286,"ABSTRACT
Renal transplantation remains the only long-term solution to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which affects
approximately 2 million people worldwide. However, long term allograft acceptance requires lifelong
immunosuppression, and current standard-of-care immunosuppressive therapies have a multitude of toxicities
directly leading to decreased patient and allograft survival. Targeted anti-rejection therapies focusing on T cell
co-stimulatory blockade, such as belatacept (CTLA4-Ig) or iscalimab (anti-CD40 mAb) have been developed to
prevent T cell mediated rejection. Despite enhanced graft function, rejection episodes under these therapies are
more frequent and difficult to treat.Current dogma suggests that these rejections are due to memory CD8+ T cell
cross-reactivity from prior infections, which do not require co-stimulation. Here we will examine the cross-
reactivity of expanded, graft-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in rejection biopsies from both humans and mice. Our novel
preliminary data suggest that expanded CD8+ T cell clonotypes in the graft are alloreactive, and prior viral
infection increases the alloresponse. These preliminary findings include: (a) a limited number of unique
clonotypes are expanded in the rejecting allograft; (b) the same individual expanded CD8+ T cell clones are
observed for months in persistent allograft rejection; (c) expanded clonotypes shift their gene expression to
escape immunosuppression; and (d) subcloning of TCRs from expanded clonotypes into Jurkat cells confirmed
their allospecificity. Further, we show that using established mouse models of viral infection and transplantation:
(e) prior LCMV infection increases the response to alloantigen; and (f) mice without prior LCMV infection reject
F1 heart allografts by day 14 post-transplant. Finally, we have samples from patients undergoing rejection after
administration of viral-specific T cell therapy to treat infection. Together, our findings and existing literature
support a highly novel hypothesis that a significant fraction of pre-existing viral-specific memory T cells
home to the allograft shortly after transplant and their cross-reactivity to alloantigens drives rejection
events. We propose to test this hypothesis by: (i) identifying alloreactive, viral-reactive, and cross-reactive graft-
infiltrating CD8+ T cells in patients undergoing renal allograft rejection (Aim 1) and (ii) determining the impact of
prior viral infection on CD8+ T cell infiltration into the allograft of a mouse model of transplantation (Aim 2). Our
studies will enhance the knowledge of cross-reactive CD8+ T cells in renal allograft rejection and the
characterization of alloreactive T cells on human disease. Given the organ shortage crisis and the limited life
expectancies of transplant patients, defining the specificity of alloreactive CD8+ T cells in renal transplant
rejection will enable discovery of novel therapeutic targets to directly target alloreactive cells while sparing
bystander CD8+ T cells responsible for maintaining immunity to infections or cancers."

Ataxia Telangiectasia (AT), a multisystemic neurodegenerative disease characterized by decreasing motor
coordination, mental development, immune defects, and telangiectasia of the eyes, affects up to 1 in 40,000 to
100,000 people worldwide. A recessive early childhood onset disorder, AT is caused by mutations within the
ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) threonine/serine kinase which plays crucial roles within the DNA damage
response (DDR). However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying AT pathogenesis and how ATM loss-
of-function leads to deficient DDR remain elusive. R-loops, three stranded RNA-DNA structures composed of an
DNA-RNA hybrid and a non-template DNA strand, have emerged as key components of double strand break
(DSB)-induced DDR. Mounting evidence has documented critical roles of R-loops in both causing and
responding to DSBs. As DSBs and the failure of their repair play major roles in the pathology of AT, R-loop
dysregulation is likely to contribute to AT pathogenesis. One recently identified kinase substrate of ATM is
methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3) protein, a N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase. m6A on the RNA
strand of R-loops is present inside nuclei and affects R-loop formation during DSB repair. The relationship
between ATM-METTL3 phosphorylation in response to DNA damage and regulation of R-loop formation, which
could play crucial roles in AT pathogenesis, has yet to be defined. Our preliminary data has demonstrated a
global trend of R-loops decreasing in AT patient-derived neurons compared to healthy controls. ~20% of these
lost loci were rescued in an isogenic line where the ATM mutation had been corrected. We hypothesize that in
AT, the lack of METTL3 phosphorylation by ATM could globally dysregulate R-loop formation and underly AT
progression. In Aim 1 we will investigate the global landscape of R-loops and analyze their effect on gene
expression and chromatin accessibility throughout neuronal differentiation in healthy, AT-derived, and isogenic
neurons. In Aim 2, we will define how ATM-mediated phosphorylation of METTL3 impacts the formation of R-
loops. We will generate iPSC-derived motor neurons from age-matched healthy controls, AT patients, and their
isogenic lines with the pathogenic mutations corrected by genome editing to systematically identify critical R-
loop loci that are associated with AT and mechanistically explore the role of ATM truncations in AT progression
through METTL3-dependent R-loop regulation."
10884181,"Bacterial glycoconjugates are a diverse group of macromolecules that play a key role in bacterial survival and
pathogenicity by mediating bacteria-host interactions. Despite their structural diversity, many glycoconjugates
are made by prokaryotes utilizing a common mechanism, which includes transferring glycans to a Pren-PP-
linked carrier at the membrane interface. The striking diversity of glycoconjugates is achieved through sequential
addition of glycans by glycosyltransferases (GTs), which transfer sugars from soluble nucleotide-activated
donors (NDP-sugars) to the lipid-based carrier molecule. Despite being ubiquitous across all kingdoms of life,
GTs still represent an excellent target for antibiotics, due to the remarkable degree of selectivity they exhibit for
structurally very similar sugars. Understanding the structural features that influence GT substrate selectivity and
protein-protein interactions in pathogenic bacteria like Campylobacter species is critical for antibiotic
development, and this research proposal strives to address that knowledge gap. To date, the substrates for C.
jejuni GTs have been confirmed in the Campylobacter genus, but structural information for PglA, PglJ, PglH1,
and PglH2 of C. concisus, another clinically significant human pathogen, is still unavailable. Additionally,
characterizing GTs from the same organism's glycoconjugate biosynthetic pathway will offer the structural
information needed for future protein-protein interaction studies and will pave the way for analysis to clarify how
these proteins interact to modulate pathway flux. Aim 1 of this proposal will identify preferred GT substrates
using nano-differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) and determine steady-state kinetic parameters using
luminescence-based GT activity assays. Aim 2 will be to discover the detergent and buffer conditions required
for crystallization of purified GTs, as well as to optimize protein crystals and collect X-ray crystal data to obtain
high-resolution crystal structures. Aim 3 will be to characterize a number of orthologs from a GT-B sequence
similarity network (SSN) in order to gain insight into GT evolution and to pinpoint the primary sequence variables
that account for their various substrate specificities. Interprotein covariance between GT residues will be
investigated via the GREMLIN method in order to identify interactions responsible for the hypothesized formation
of supramolecular complexes between these enzymes. The resulting findings will reveal binding determinants
controlling specificity for glycans prevalent in pathogenic prokaryotes and demonstrate crucial structure-function
links and protein-protein interactions."

A hallmark of cancer is the ability of malignant cells to maintain viability in the face of stressors such as
aneuploidy, nutrient scarcity, and xenobiotic compounds. This multi-stress-resilience phenotype enables tumor
formation, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Individual molecular pathways co-opted by cancer cells to
promote stress resilience have been thoroughly characterized, but how these specialized pathways are
integrated in complex physiological stress states remains poorly understood. Recently, we used genome-scale
fitness screening data to estimate the intrinsic stress phenotype of 689 diverse cancer cell and identify genes
which are selectively essential in cancer cells highly reliant on multiple distinct stress response pathways.
Through our integrative analysis, we discovered C16orf72, a previously uncharacterized protein which is broadly
stress-inducible and promotes resilience to mechanistically diverse stress insults. We have determined that
C16orf72 physically interacts with HUWE1, an E3 ligase known to ubiquitinate proteins involved in stress
response pathways. Moreover, loss of either C16orf72 or HUWE1 produces highly similar transcriptomic and
ubiquitination phenotypes while not affecting expression of the other factor. Thus, our overarching hypothesis is
that C16orf72 mediates stress resilience by physically interacting with HUWE1 to promote HUWE1-mediated
ubiquitination of proteins with critical roles in diverse stress response pathways. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will
define the binding interface of C16orf72 and HUWE1 and test several non-exclusive models by which C16orf72
regulates HUWE1 enzymatic activity. In Aim 2, we will determine the substrates and specific modifications which
underly the role of C16orf72 and HUWE1 in cellular stress resilience and canonical stress response signaling.
In Aim 3, we will determine the extent to which C16orf72 is required for in vivo tumorigenesis and the
development of therapy resistance in breast cancer. The long-term goals of the proposed work are to determine
the molecular mechanism by which C16orf72 promotes cellular stress resilience and investigate the therapeutic
potential of blocking the C16orf72/HUWE1 axis in cancer cells."

Daily low-dose aspirin is routinely prescribed to prevent cardiovascular (CV) events, despite conflicting data on
its efficacy, especially with increasing body weight. While intended to inhibit platelet aggregation, aspirin has
other effects that may be important in reducing CV risk that are influenced by body weight.
 Obesity and atherosclerosis are both characterized by chronic, low-grade inflammation and some
treatments aimed at reducing inflammation improve CV outcomes. The resolution of inflammation requires
specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs). Several SPMs and their precursors are termed “aspirin-
triggered” (AT), as their production is stimulated in the presence of acetylated COX-2. We and others have
shown that AT-SPMs, including 15-epi-lipoxin A4 (15R-LXA4), are reduced in blood and tissues from obese
humans. Pre-clinical models have established that AT-SPMs inhibit atherosclerosis progression and have
plaque stabilizing effects. Small cross-sectional human cohorts have shown AT-SPMs inversely associated
with severity of atherosclerosis, but a potential association with prospective CV outcomes has not been tested.
 The largest meta-analysis of aspirin trials showed that low-dose aspirin was effective at reducing major
adverse CV events (MACE) only in those weighing <70kg, whereas doses >300mg exhibited increasing
efficacy as body weight increased. While suggested to explain these findings, data on incomplete platelet
COX-1 inhibition from low-dose aspirin with increasing body weight are inconclusive. Thus, aspirin-mediated
factors extrinsic to platelet function in aggregation and thrombosis, such as deficient AT-SPMs, may mediate
obesity’s role in CVD and reduced benefit from low-dose aspirin with increasing body weight.
 Our central hypothesis is that reduced levels of AT-SPMs contribute to excess CV risk and worse CV
outcomes with low-dose aspirin therapy. In our first Aim, we will test the effects of low- and regular-dose aspirin
regimens on AT-SPM levels and cellular function in humans across a wide range of body weights using a
randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. We will measure lipid mediators, including thromboxanes,
leukotrienes, and SPMs, in serum and neutrophils before and after treatment with aspirin. We will also assess
measures of cellular inflammation including platelet activity, platelet-leukocyte aggregates, and leukocyte
surface expression of SPM receptors. In Aim 2, we will assess a predictive capacity of 15R-LXA4 for MACE in
persons with stable ischemic heart disease taking aspirin. Using a nested case-control design, we will assess
serum SPM profiles in 402 subjects in the ISCHEMIA randomized controlled trial and evaluate the capacity of
SPM profiles to predict CV outcomes in these subjects. We will also assess a mediating effect of body weight
on 15R-LXA4 levels.
 This work will evaluate a novel mechanistic role for aspirin in CVD treatment, separate from thrombosis,
that may explain worse outcomes with increasing body weight."
10814788,"ABSTRACT. Transforming growth factor beta2 (TGF-β2) is an important therapeutic target for renal fibrosis, the
principal cause of end-stage renal failure in chronic kidney disease (CKD). TGF-β2 triggers renal fibrosis in vivo
and, in response to kidney injury, is upregulated in renal myofibroblasts, pericytes, and proximal tubule epithelial
cells—cell types that mediate kidney fibrosis. Earlier studies showed that an antibody to mature TGF-β2 arrested
renal fibrosis in a rat model of diabetic kidney disease, but further therapeutic development was not followed up.
In vivo, TGF-β2 exists mainly as a latent pro-complex (proTGF-β2) in which prodomains are noncovalently bound
to the growth factor. Secreted proTGF-β2 is stored in different extracellular milieus where it undergoes activation,
i.e. release of the growth factor (mature TGF-β2), to initiate signaling. Preliminary data point to αVβ6-dependent
and -independent mechanisms of proTGF-β2 activation as different modalities that can be therapeutically
targeted for renal fibrosis. Aim 1 of this proposal is to develop new antibodies that specifically target the
prodomain and block proTGF-β2 activation as a novel therapeutic strategy for renal fibrosis. Antibodies will be
selected from an innovative yeast display antibody library, screened for activation-blocking activity in vitro, and
tested for therapeutic efficacy in mouse models of acute kidney injury. Aim 2 is to determine high-resolution
crystal structures of proTGF-β2 to define the mechanism underlying latency and facilitate drug development by
uncovering new strategies to prevent activation. The candidate has assembled an exceptional team of mentors
and advisors with expertise in renal pathophysiology, drug discovery, and structural biology to ensure the
success of the project. The team will provide career guidance and training in techniques essential for the
candidate’s future independent career at the interface of structural biology, drug discovery, renal fibrosis, and
CKD. The candidate will receive extensive training in 1) X-ray crystallography, 2) antibody discovery, 3) renal
pathophysiology, 4) immunofluorescence microscopy, and 5) mouse models of acute kidney injury and renal
fibrosis. These skills will extend the candidate’s already versatile foundation in genetics, molecular biology,
protein biochemistry, and structural biology. Boston Children’s Hospital and surrounding institutions (e.g.,
Harvard Medical School) constitute a robust training environment with unparalleled intellectual capital and
remarkable infrastructure, which include cutting-edge yeast display platforms for antibody discovery at the
Institute for Protein Innovation and unparalleled resources and expertise in the Renal Division at Brigham and
Women’s Hospital, that will enhance the candidate’s growth and support his proposed research. Career
development will be accomplished through direct mentorship, education through fellowship training offices, and
attendance of conferences. The results of this proposal will establish the foundation of the candidate’s future
research programs as an independent investigator in renal biology. The candidate plans to apply for the NIDDK
Small Grant Program if available to K awardees and an R01 to facilitate his transition to independence."

 The global public health strategy to decrease mortality from antimicrobial resistant (AMR) infections
encourages removal of inaccurate penicillin (PCN) allergy labels, termed “de-labeling.” PCN allergy de-labeling
is recommended as ~10% of all people report a PCN allergy, but only 5% of those (i.e., <1%) have a true PCN
allergy confirmed after formal testing. Prescription of alternative antibiotics in individuals with PCN allergy
labels results in inferior clinical outcomes, increased adverse events including Clostridioides difficile infection,
increased methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and increased health care costs. PCN allergy de-
labeling is an evidence-based strategy that can decrease exposure to more broad-spectrum and suboptimal
antibiotics, potentially reducing multi-drug resistant and healthcare-associated infections and saving lives. Most
efforts to improve access to PCN allergy de-labeling have been reactive in acute care settings at the time of
antibiotic need, rather than proactive in ambulatory care settings. Furthermore, PCN allergy de-labeling efforts
to date have not focused on health care equity despite AMR rates being highest in minoritized communities.
 This application focuses on identifying feasible and acceptable strategies to increase equitable access
to PCN allergy de-labeling. Our long-term goal is to decrease AMR infections with a purposeful focus on
reducing infection-associated health disparities. This study considers three Boston-based hospital networks
serving diverse communities and with disparate allergy specialist access for studies that aim to improve
equitable access to PCN allergy de-labeling. Our specific research aims include: 1) determining patient,
societal, clinician, and institutional factors associated with PCN allergy de-labeling; 2) investigating barriers and
facilitators to PCN allergy de-labeling in primary care with qualitative methods; and 3) identification, refining,
and evaluating implementation strategies to increase equitable access to PCN allergy de-labeling.
 To achieve these aims, we leverage a multidisciplinary research team comprised of leaders in
infectious diseases, allergy/immunology, primary care, and health disparities with broad methodologic
expertise in large database research, qualitative research, and implementation science. This application is
responsive to PA-22-047, aligns with the mission of AHRQ, and our universal commitments to improve health
care, make health care more equitable, and reduce the global crisis of antimicrobial resistance."

Pediatric cardiomyopathies (PCM) are rare but serious disorders of the cardiac muscle with early childhood
onset, limited treatment options, that often culminate in childhood death due to limited effective treatments. A
recently published exome sequencing study of 528 patients with various types of PCM, the largest to date,
revealed insights into the genetic architecture of PCM and identified 343 variants in 125 genes. The findings
affirmed that pediatric CM has different genetic underpinnings than adult-onset CM. It further demonstrated the
genetic complexity of PCM; with patients carrying variant in multiple genes, suggesting a polygenic nature, and
variants in the same gene associated with different PCM types. Moreover, most of the candidate genes have not
been studied in the heart before. To bridge the gap between candidate variant and disease causation, our team
has developed an in silico pipeline to identify the candidate suited for modeling in the Drosophila heart, to
prioritize them by likelihood to cause a functional defect in the protein, and assign the best modeling approach
in fly based on the mutation type. We will then follow this through with our “gene replacement” approach for
efficient “gene-level” and “variant-level” functional validations in the fly heart, to rapidly screen the 343 PCM
candidate variants. Specifically, we will: 1) Use bioinformatic tools tailored to Drosophila, to screen the candidate
PCM genes and variants for their feasibility to be modeled in the fly heart, to determine the best modeling
approach for each, and to provide interspecies (fly-human) cardiac phenotypic correlations to be shared with the
clinical and research communities. 2) Use our fly heart-specific RNAi gene silencing system to provide “gene-
level” validation for all candidate PCM variants, likely to cause loss-of-function, and designated feasible for
modeling in the Drosophila heart. We will expand the cardiac phenotype assays for fly to develop a
comprehensive assessment that can distinguish between the different PCM types. We will use the findings in
the PCM fly models to generate a cardiac phenotype library. 3) Use our Drosophila “gene replacement” approach
to provide “variant-level” validation for candidate PCM variants that are gain-of-function or of uncertain effect, as
well as to generate precision polygenic models for patients carrying multiple genetic variants. Successful
completion of the proposed aims will establish a highly efficient “in silico - in vivo” pipeline to screen and
functionally validate genetic variants identified from patients with PCM, provide causal association for hundreds
of PCM candidate variants, and establish interspecies cardiac phenotypic correlation from Drosophila to humans.
Many of the fly PCM models generated in this project will be “precision disease models” since they carry the
specific human patient variants in the fly heart and thus could be used in the future to study disease mechanisms
and to test targeted therapies."

Childhood obesity is a high priority public health issue as it increases the risk of co-morbid diseases, including
cardiovascular disease, fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes. An improved understanding of the factors that
trigger the development of early life obesity is urgently needed. This is especially important among Hispanics, a
minority group with high rates of obesity in early life. Beyond poor diet and a lack of physical activity, early life
exposure to environmental chemicals, which are higher in underserved communities, independently contribute
to childhood obesity. Human studies show that even at low levels of exposure during pregnancy, poly- and
perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are associated with rapid infant weight gain and greater risk for childhood
obesity. Postnatally, breastfeeding is a primary source of inadvertent PFAS transmission to infants, potentially
offsetting some benefits of extended breastfeeding. Recent findings suggest that the developing gut microbiome
is exposed to breast milk PFAS, which may alter gut bacteria and fecal metabolites that contribute to obesity.
Despite this, human studies have largely focused on prenatal PFAS exposure, and no prior studies have
examined the effects of breast milk PFAS on rapid infant growth and the gut microbiome during infancy, a critical
period in which interventions have the potential to prevent the development of childhood obesity. Our overarching
hypothesis is that higher concentrations of breast milk PFAS contribute to more rapid infant growth and childhood
obesity risk, and that these effects are explained by alterations in the composition and function of the infant gut
microbiome. This hypothesis is based on results from our preliminary data, which demonstrate that infant gut
bacteria are associated with infant weight and breast milk PFAS at 6-months of age. Our multidisciplinary team
of investigators propose to test this hypothesis in a cohort of 208 Hispanic mother-child pairs with assessments
of child growth at 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36-months as well as at 6yr of age. This study will measure breast milk
PFAS concentrations and characterize the infant gut microbiome and fecal metabolome using archived breast
milk and stool samples at 1- and 6-months to advance our mechanistic understanding of the obesogenic effects
of PFAS exposure while accounting for prenatal PFAS exposure using newborn dried blood spots. Our aims are
to determine the extent to which early life exposure to breast milk PFAS are associated with: 1) child weight from
1-month to 6 years (Aim 1A) and the risk of rapid growth and childhood obesity (Aim 1B) as well as 2) changes
in gut microbial profiles and fecal metabolites (Aim 2). Our ultimate goal (Aim 3) is to integrate breast milk PFAS
exposure, gut microbiome, and fecal metabolomics profiles to identify subgroups of children that are at increased
risk for rapid growth and obesity. This study offers a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of breast
milk PFAS and may identify preventive measures that could be used to offset obesity-risk, including screening
for breast milk PFAS and the use of probiotics to promote growth of beneficial gut bacteria in early life."

The overall premise of this PPG application is that there are shared biologic pathways in the development of
COPD and IPF. To further understand the epidemiologic, biologic, and genetic characteristics of COPD and
IPF (divergent pulmonary response to common noxious exposures such as tobacco smoke) we are proposing
to aggregate and curate data from several existing COPD and IPF cohorts as well as create a de-novo bron-
choscopy cohort. This Clinical Biorepository Core will provide a harmonized standard dataset for all co-
investigators in this application. These data will include clinical, epidemiologic, physiologic and radiologic sub-
typing information as well as biospecimens which will be used for cross sectional and longitudinal analyses.
To achieve these goals, the Clinical Biorepository Core has brought together an internationally recognized
team of investigators whose expertise spans clinical investigation, radiologic assessments and bronchoscopic
studies. The existing cohorts to be leveraged by this investigation include three NIH funded projects,
COPDGene, SPIROMICS and the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC), each of which has a wealth of
phenotypic data that will be leveraged for disease subtyping. This Core will also leverage a foundation funded
effort called the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation Clinical Care Registry and Biorepository (PFF). Finally, the
prospective Bronchoscopy Population will include 40 ex-smoking subjects with COPD (20 with emphysema
predominant and 20 with airway predominant disease), 30 ex-smokers with IPF (15 with Typical UIP and 15
with probable/inconsistent UIP) and 20 age and sex matched controls (all ex-smokers)."

Fibrosis and emphysema represent divergent clinical phenotypes that emerge during the pathogenesis of chronic
lung diseases induced by cigarette smoke (CS). We have uncovered Udistinct mitochondrial and metabolic
pathways in response to injurious stimuli that may underlie divergent pathways leading to fibrosis or emphysema
outcomesU. Mitochondria are key organelles that regulate metabolism and energy generation, with complex
processes governing their dynamics (fusion, fission), and turnover (mitophagy). Mitochondrial dysfunction is an
emerging mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of many human diseases including COPD and IPF. We have
demonstrated that mitochondrial dysfunction mediates CS-induced epithelial cell injury/emphysema
development, and bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis; and interestingly, that genetic deficiency in the
critical mitophagy regulator PTEN-induced putative kinase-1 (PINK1) is UprotectiveU in preclinical models of CS-
induced emphysema while UdeleteriousU in BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Moreover, PINK1-dependent
mitophagy was linked to the activation of receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIPK3), a key signaling kinase
mediating regulated necrosis (necroptosis). We have published that RIPK3 regulates metabolic processes in
organ tissue, including (FA) biosynthetic pathways, and observed that genetic deficiency in fatty acid synthase
(FASN), aggravated pulmonary fibrosis. Interestingly, we have found that CS-induced lung injury may trigger
systemic responses including injury to distal organs (kidney). Moreover, we and others have found that
circulating cell-free (cf)-mtDNA, an established marker of mitochondrial injury and dysfunction, is regulated in
plasma or urine of COPD and IPF patients, and that cf-mtDNA sequence variability (heteroplasmy) may play
critical roles in the pathogenesis of lung diseases. These intriguing data suggest that mitochondrial pathways
influence functional and clinical phenotypes (fibrosis vs. emphysema) in response to CS exposure and led us to
propose the following Uhypotheses:U Mitochondrial dysfunction in response to CS can regulate pathways leading
to divergent phenotype in COPD or IPF, including the activation of PINK-dependent mitophagy and downstream
regulation of RIPK3. Furthermore, key metabolic and mitochondrial signals including mitochondrial fusion/fission
and lipid metabolism may determine cellular pathways leading to emphysema or fibrosis. Plasma and/or urinary
cf-mtDNA, as well as degree of mitochondrial heteroplasmy, may correlate with severity of IPF and COPD. We
will address our hypotheses in the following USpecific Aims:U Specific Aim 1: To determine the functional
significance of PINK1-regulated RIPK3 signaling in experimental emphysema and fibrosis. Specific Aim 2: To
determine the mechanism(s) by which mitochondrial and metabolic pathways regulate PINK1-RIPK3 signaling
in experimental emphysema and fibrosis. Specific Aim 3: To evaluate whether circulating or urinary cf-mtDNA is
associated with severity of disease in IPF and COPD."

COPD and fibrotic disorders like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have remarkably different pathologies with
the former characterized by tissue loss and the latter by interstitial fibrosis and excess matrix deposition.
However, recent studies highlighted a subgroup of patients with COPD with both emphysema and interstitial
lung abnormalities (ILA) and demonstrated that injury and repair play critical roles in both disorders. They also
demonstrated that TGF-β1 is a mediator that is dysregulated in both that has the surprising ability to drive fibrosis
while augmenting tissue injury and cell death. To define the mechanisms that determine if TGF-β1 cause
emphysema and or fibrosis, we generated lung-targeted TGF-β1 transgenic (Tg) mice on 10 inbred genetic
backgrounds. Using In silico haplotype evaluations and expression microarray analysis on these mice, we have
identified genes associated with TGF-β1-induced fibrosis or emphysema. Interestingly, the studies of these TGF-
β1 genetic modifiers all led to the prototypic chitinase-like protein, chitinase 3-like-1 (Chi3l1) and its receptors.
 To further understand the role(s) of the Chi3l1 axis in emphysema and fibrosis, recent studies have focused
on the biology of Chi3l1 and its receptors. These studies demonstrated that; (1) Chi3l1 is induced at sites of
injury and repair where it inhibits injury while fostering repair, (2) In cigarette smoke (CS)-induced emphysema
and bleomycin responses, Chi3l1 inhibits epithelial cell death and tissue destruction and drives tissue fibrosis
respectively, (3) The effects of Chi3l1 are mediated by 2 different receptors, a multimeric complex called the
chitosome that regulates cell death and CRTH2 which drives fibroproliferative repair, (4) The chitosome has one
alpha subunit (IL-13Rα2) and 2 different β subunits, TMEM219 (TMEM) and galectin 3 (Gal3), which competes
with TMEM for IL-13Rα2 binding. Our most recent studies have also highlighted phosphorylated and non-
phosphorylated forms of Chi3l1, demonstrated that the components of the chitosome are regulated by epigenetic
modifications and highlighted relationships between the Chi3l1 axis and mitochondria. These findings led to the
overall hypothesis for this project: The differential expression, utilization and or phosphorylation of Chi3l1 and its
receptors play major roles in the generation of the divergent outcomes of fibrosis and emphysema. To address
this hypothesis, we will (Aim#1) characterize the relationships between the fibrosis-associated and emphysema-
associated TGF-β1 genetic modifiers and Chi3l1 and its receptors in the lung at baseline, after exposure to CS
or TGF-β1, and in animal models of fibrosis and emphysema, (Aim#2) characterize the site, mechanism and
consequences of Chi3l1 activation/deactivation via cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), the phosphatase PP2A &
FAM13A, (Aim #3) characterize the importance of IL-13Rα2 glycosylation and epigenetic modifications of IL-
13Rα2 and TMEM in the trafficking, binding and effector responses of Chi3l1, (Aim #4) characterize the
interactions between the Chi3l1 axis and mitochondria; specifically, how mitochondria regulate the Chi3l1 axis
and how the axis regulates mitochondrial function, dynamics, biogenesis, metabolism, and mitophagy."
10862737,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The variable development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(IPF) among smokers could relate to genetic variants, epigenetic determinants, environmental factors, or their
interactions. Rather than operating in isolation, genetic and epigenetic determinants of COPD and IPF likely
influence molecular networks of interacting genes and proteins. Based on progress in murine and human studies
in the first cycle of this PPG, we will focus on mitochondrial and chitinase pathways as potential molecular
switches that impact whether individuals develop COPD or IPF. We hypothesize that a molecular network of
genetic and epigenetic determinants regulating mitochondrial and chitinase proteins confers differential
susceptibility of smokers to develop COPD or IPF. In addition, we hypothesize that mitochondrial and chitinase
pathways influence the heterogeneous manifestations of COPD and IPF. In order to investigate the differential
susceptibility to develop COPD and IPF and the impact of these pathways on COPD and IPF subtypes, we will
leverage our human population-based and genetic/epigenetic resources in COPD and IPF, including the Lung
Tissue Research Consortium (LTRC) and multiple replication populations. We will measure a panel of chitinase
and mitochondrial pathway proteins in plasma and lung biospecimens and test for their association with COPD
and IPF and their related phenotypes. We will identify genetic variants, mitochondrial characteristics, and DNA
methylation marks that influence expression of chitinase and mitochondrial pathway proteins in lung and blood
samples and determine whether these variants are also associated with COPD and/or IPF. We will identify
network relationships within and between the mitochondrial and chitinase pathways by using correlation-based
networks, gene regulatory networks, and protein-protein interaction networks. Key network relationships within
and between mitochondrial and chitinase pathways will be validated using CRISPR-based functional approaches
in lung epithelial cells, monocyte-macrophages, and fibroblasts with readouts of cell death, fibrosis, chitosome
components, mitochondrial function, and inflammation to identify shared and divergent network determinants of
IPF and COPD."

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent disorder characterized by repetitive upper airway obstruction
that has major deleterious effects on health. However, the leading treatment, continuous positive airway pressure
(CPAP), is poorly tolerated by many individuals. Thus, new treatment strategies are needed.
We recently discovered that neural ventilatory drive plays a far greater role in upper airway obstruction than
previously appreciated: In a 60% majority of patients, ventilatory drive falls in tight synchrony with the loss of
airflow during respiratory events; these patients—referred to as “drive-dependent”—no longer exhibit respiratory
events when drive rises at some time during the night (<10% likelihood at 200% resting drive). By contrast,
patients who exhibit “classic” events (reduced airflow despite rising drive), continue to exhibit events regardless
of drive. The current proposal will address major clinically-relevant questions that emerged from this discovery:
● In Aim 1, we will show that the role for ventilatory drive in OSA is experimentally reversible (i.e. causal). Falling
ventilatory drive during events will be mitigated with carefully-timed inspired carbon dioxide stimulation (2% for
3-4 breaths). We expect to show that events are prevented, and the characteristic loss of airflow and pharyngeal
muscle activity (genioglossus EMG) is spared, when falling drive (per intraesophageal diaphragm EMG) is
averted. Benefits are expected exclusively in patients with “drive-dependent OSA” (N=18) but not “classic OSA”
(N=18). ● The discovery also has major implications for which patients may respond to the promising ventilatory
drive stimulant acetazolamide. In Aim 2, in a randomized placebo-controlled mechanistic crossover trial, we will
assess whether drive-dependent OSA (N=18) is more amenable to ventilatory drive stimulation with
acetazolamide than classic OSA (N=18). Physiological measurements of ventilation and ventilatory drive will
describe how acetazolamide, by mitigating dips in drive, raises airflow and prevents events exclusively in “drive-
dependent OSA”. An open label extension will confirm subgroup differences over a longer period (4-weeks). ●
In a translational aim (Aim 3), we will refine our clinically-applicable method to identify drive-dependent OSA
from routine sleep studies, and thereby predict responders to acetazolamide therapy (precision medicine). Our
preliminary model using five clinically-recognizable characteristics already demonstrates potential clinical utility.
Further methods development will utilize non-invasive ventilatory drive surrogates to improve the preliminary
model, which will be prospectively validated using the new physiological studies in Aims 1 and 2.
Overall, our proposal will establish that mitigating ventilatory drive decline is a promising therapeutic strategy for
a large recognizable subgroup of OSA patients. The work will also provide the necessary background knowledge
for further trials of acetazolamide or other drive interventions in selected patients with drive-dependent OSA
(precision medicine), and has great potential to improve OSA-related adverse health outcomes for those without
a tolerable therapy for their untreated disorder."

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a disease impacting much of the aging male population, affecting 50% of
men 50 and older, and increasing to 90% of men 80 and older. The etiology of BPH is complex and multifactorial,
though proliferation, smooth muscle dysfunction and fibrosis within the prostate are often considered the largest
contributing factors, in addition to age. Estrogen signaling via receptors (ERs) within the prostate have been
shown to play conflicting roles, with ERα associated with increased proliferation while ERβ with apoptotic
processes. Current BPH therapeutic strategies target androgen biosynthesis without considering that androgens
are regularly converted to estrogenic ligands in the steroid hormone signaling pathway. I hypothesize that
estrogen signaling within the prostate, specifically ERα activity, induces prostatic fibrosis and thus
contributes to the development of lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) and BPH. I aim to evaluate this
hypothesis through the use of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics analyses. With the development of
high resolution and accurate mass instrumentation, MS has become the preferred technique for deep, targeted
and global proteomic profiling investigations. In addition, the development of mass spectrometry imaging (MSI)
allows for high throughput analysis of protein and peptide species in a biological tissue with no prior knowledge,
thus obtaining critical spatial information of hundreds of analytes in a single imaging run. I plan to utilize the high
sensitivity and selectivity of both MSI and traditional chromatography-based LC-MS/MS experiments to reach
the following goals: 1) to determine if ERα agonism in mice promotes prostatic fibrosis and LUTD and 2) to
uncover if loss of ERα function decreases prostatic fibrosis in vivo. Collectively, these aims will both facilitate the
use of MS-based strategies in urologic research and yield novel insights into the complex roles that estrogen
receptor alpha plays within the prostate."

 Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that, in the U.S., affects 1.6 million people, amasses
$16 billion in annual healthcare expenses, and annually rises in prevalence by 64,000 new diagnoses. Clinical
islet transplantation (CIT), which is infusion of islets through the hepatic portal vein, has shown promise as a
T1D treatment. However, only 50% of recipients maintain insulin independence at five years and the procedure
is currently limited to a marginal subset of T1D patients, in part due to two major limitations: instant blood-
mediated inflammatory reaction and delayed vascularization of islets (>14 days). A significant loss of
delivered islets – 60-80% – occurs within hours to days following transplantation in the intrahepatic site.
Therefore, there is a significant need to establish an alternative transplant site that avoids instant blood-
mediated inflammatory reaction and supports the long-term engraftment of islets. The subcutaneous
site is an attractive extrahepatic site with high clinical potential in terms of accessibility, convenience, ability to
re-dose (if necessary), ease of monitoring, and ease of retrieval (if necessary). However, the unmodified
subcutaneous site is clinically limited due to inadequate vascular perfusion and, as a result, inadequate metabolic
kinetics and low oxygenation. An elegant, facile strategy to promote neovascularization is the biomaterial-
mediated delivery of proangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF
promotes the growth of endothelial cells and is a major regulator of native islet vascularization and development.
The objective of this project is to engineer injectable VEGF-delivering synthetic poly(ethylene glycol) [PEG]
hydrogels that promote islet vascularization, engraftment, and function in the subcutaneous space. We have
previously engineered VEGF-containing hydrogels that promote islet survival, vascularization, and function in
the rodent gonadal fat pad and omentum, sites with high inherent vascularization. My central hypothesis is
that the VEGF-delivering gel can be further optimized to promote islet vascularization, engraftment, and
function in the subcutaneous space, a site with high clinical potential. My preliminary data support this
hypothesis and provide strong scientific premise and feasibility for this application. The overall objective will
be accomplished across three specific aims: 1) Identify VEGF-PEG hydrogel formulations that optimally support
islet vascularization using a vascularized islet-on-a-chip platform; 2) Evaluate the ability of VEGF-PEG hydrogels
to promote allogeneic islet vascularization, engraftment, and function in diabetic rats; and 3) Examine the ability
of VEGF-hydrogels to promote allogeneic islet vascularization and engraftment in the subcutaneous space of
non-diabetic pigs. Expected outcomes for this project include: 1) An injectable delivery vehicle for islets that
promotes islet vascularization, engraftment, and function in the subcutaneous space and 2) Validation results in
a large animal model that will inform future studies in a translational diabetic large animal model."

 Transcription regulation underlies the diversity of cell types and functions. The process of transcription itself
has multiple steps that may be regulated separately. Promoter-proximal RNA Pol II pausing has recently been
described as a widespread rate-limiting step of transcription and a possible point of gene regulation. Studies
disrupting the critical pausing factor Negative elongation factor-B (Nelf-b) in mouse and mouse embryonic stem
cells (mES) highlighted its essential role in development and a cross-talk with FGF/ERK signaling transduction.
However, it is unclear what role pausing plays in mammalian development. Furthermore, it is unclear how
pausing may affect specific targets of FGF/ERK signaling, and whether this cross-talk is relevant in vivo.
The long-term goal of this proposal is to establish a molecular understanding of how gene regulation can be
achieved at the level of promoter-proximal pausing during transcription. The objective of the present proposal is
to mechanistically determine the role of pausing during epiblast pluripotency transitions in early mammalian
development. This objective will be achieved by a detailed phenotypic and transcriptomic analysis of Nelf-b-/-
embryos at several early developmental stages to analyze pluripotency transitions (Aim 1). To expand on these
results and interrogate pausing at a high molecular and temporal resolution, a Nelf-b-degron mES cell line has
been established to test the immediate and direct effects of pausing-loss in mES cells under different signaling
conditions. I will utilize nascent RNA-seq techniques and directed differentiation approaches to build a
mechanistic link between pausing, FGF/ERK transcriptional activation, and pluripotency transitions in embryos
and mES cells (Aim 2). My central hypothesis is that pausing is required for epiblast pluripotency
transitions in mouse development via direct regulation of FGF/ERK transcriptional targets.
 The expected outcome of this project is to uncover the mechanistic link between pausing and signal
transduction, explain the role of pausing in mammalian development. It promises to yield novel insights into gene
regulation at the pausing level. The link between pausing and signaling is of high importance to other biological
contexts considering the prevalence of pausing and necessity of signal transduction to perform fundamental
cellular functions beyond responses to FGF/ERK in development. Furthermore, given that FGF/ERK signaling
is amongst the top dysregulated pathways in developmental diseases and malignancies, insights into the
molecular mechanisms of this pathway will yield novel insights to therapeutically target it."

Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are 2-3 times more likely to suffer from sleep
problems than typically developing children. Despite being a high priority population for sleep
research, and despite evidence that sleep problems have pervasive negative consequences for
health, behavior, mood, and cognition, the increased occurrence and clinical impact of sleep
problems in individuals with a family history of ASD is not well understood. This major public health
concern is the focus of our application, “Sleep, Brain Development, and Behavioral Correlates in
a Longitudinal Cohort of Children at Risk for ASD”. Problems with sleep initiation, circadian timing,
and inadequate amount of sleep in a high familial risk (HR) cohort of school-age children are
hypothesized to be preceded by altered brain and behavioral development in early childhood.
This proposal leverages a recently funded longitudinal follow-up of 7-10 year-old HR children and
children with low familial risk for ASD (LR) who have had multiple MRI and behavior assessments
since infancy through the NIH Autism Center of Excellence Infant Brain Imaging Study (IBIS). This
sample of 300 HR children includes ~100 diagnosed with ASD at 24 months, ~200 without a
diagnosis of ASD but with outcomes ranging from typical development to developmental and
psychiatric disorders known to occur at high rates in siblings of children with ASD, and 100 LR
children currently returning for assessment, including MRI, during school age. A biopsychosocial
model of pediatric sleep problems predicts that some combination of biological, environmental,
behavioral and psychiatric factors will account for the increased prevalence of sleep problems in
ASD, but it is unknown whether sleep problems are familial, endophenotypic, or disorder-specific
in this population. We propose to: (1) characterize circadian disturbances, sleep duration, and
other sleep parameters in the home using actigraphy, validated by sleep diary, and through parent
report of behavioral and medical sleep problems, (2) examine brain growth trajectories (from
infancy) associated with sleep problems in school-age, and (3) examine the longitudinal
behavioral and developmental trajectories and concurrent behavior associated with sleep
problems in school-age. Increased understanding of the neurobiology and developmental
characteristics of sleep problems in ASD has important implications for developing novel,
developmentally-sensitive sleep interventions which may help to reduce behavioral and health
problems exacerbated by sleep problems and improve outcomes in this vulnerable population."

This application would create a neuroscience training program in St. Louis (NeuroPREP) for recent
undergraduate students. The objective of the grant is to provide rigorous and critical training in neuroscience to
a diverse cohort of students taking advantage of the strong interest in neuroscience at Washington University,
the University of Missouri-St. Louis, St. Louis University and Harris-Stowe State University. By providing fully-
funded support for 2 years of independent research and an introduction to the culture of science, this proposal
will establish a pathway to graduate training in Neuroscience. NeuroPREP emphasizes sustained training in oral
and written science communication, discovery science and outreach experience. Specifically, this proposal will
support 7 early-stage trainees for two years each (3 of whom will be supported with Institutional resources).
Washington University has long-standing commitments to cutting-edge research, to interdisciplinary education,
and to providing modern career development. We seek to be a Program that responds to changes in the research
environment by helping our students to pursue important and innovative problems and concepts, to adopt new
techniques and to communicate effectively with their peers and the general public. The potential research
environment is organized as a Training Faculty of 54 active scientists who study fundamental questions in basic
and clinical neuroscience. The 54 faculty represent 16 different Departments in three different Schools at
Washington University (Arts & Sciences, Medicine, Engineering). Each faculty mentor directs a well-funded
research program and is deeply committed to provide a positive learning experience and welcoming work
environment. The curriculum for education will likewise present a broad and deep introduction to molecular,
cellular and systems-level approaches to the study of neural function and dysfunction. It will organize dedicated
courses, but also offer optional involvement in existing undergraduate and graduate coursework. The Program
will recruit and retain talented, diverse students through innovative and dedicated coordination with the University
and partner schools and be evaluated formally by an Executive Advisory Board of Directors. Major new initiatives
aimed at accomplishing these goals include: 1) creation of a local network of educators across many Schools to
identify candidates and foster the program for the benefit of the region; 2) the introduction of two interactive
courses to bolster neuroscience fundamentals and a sense of community among the students (Critical Thinking
in Neuroscience & Professional Skills for a Neuroscientist), 3) involvement of the students in the Society for
Neuroscience Brain Bee as part of their training in science communication, and 4) refinement of a near peer-
mentoring program that has graduate students working with postbaccs and postbaccs working with high school
students. These initiatives will promote our students’ education in neuroscience, and in professional skills. It will
also provide them explicit guidance in the process of graduate school applications."

discussions, formal training in clinical design and conduct, training in the responsible conduct of research as well
as rigor and reproducibility, and career development activities that complement the trainees’ laboratory and
clinical investigations. The career development component will provide information, counseling, and assistance
to help each trainee navigate the challenges that arise while establishing a successful independent translational
research career. Multiple mechanisms are in place to evaluate the performance and success of the NU-TRIHO
Training Program. The Program has strong institutional support from the Lurie Cancer Center and the Feinberg
School of Medicine’s Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics. The proposed NU-TRIHO Training Program
responds to the challenges faced by the next generation of academic hematologists and medical oncologists
and addresses the critical need for more such individuals who are well-versed in clinically relevant basic science
research, translational research, and clinical trial design."
10838459,"Project Summary
The hallmark of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is insufficient insulin production caused by pancreatic beta cell
dysfunction. Most people treat their T1D through multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin or use of a
transcutaneous insulin pump. Several decision support smartphone apps exist to help people estimate insulin
doses based on continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data and food intake. More sophisticated decision support
tools employ mathematical models of human physiology to predict future glucose levels and provide
generalized insulin therapy recommendations. Exercise is a crucial component of the long-term management
of T1D, however many people avoid physical activity for fear of hypoglycemia (< 70 mg/dL). While consensus
guidelines exist to help people manage glucose during physical activity, people still experience acute
complications. Mathematical models of aerobic exercise yield promise in predicting hypoglycemia during
controlled in- clinic experiments but do not perform well in the real-world or during other types of exercise.
There is a critical need for a decision support system that helps people with T1D maintain safe glucose levels
around exercise of varying types. The goal of this proposal is to develop a decision support tool to help people
with T1D who utilize CGM better manage their glucose surrounding exercise. This tool will be called AIDES,
the Artificially Intelligent Diabetic Exercise Support system. We hypothesize that use of a novel exercise-
specific decision support tool, powered by predictive physiological modelling, artificial intelligence (AI), and
deep learning, can provide treatment recommendations to reduce the number of hypoglycemic events
experienced by people with T1D around regular physical exercise. In our first aim, we will develop a new
model of resistance exercise that describes both insulin- and non-insulin mediated effects on glucose
dynamics. We will then create a novel hybrid computational framework that harnesses AI to augment
physiology models of aerobic and resistance exercise. This hybrid framework, called physAI, will harness real-
world, free-living exercise data from the T1Dexi project (Big Data). In our second aim, we will leverage
decades of research into deep learning with the Big Data provided by the T1Dexi project to train an AI-based
decision support system that gives treatment recommendations to help users maintain target glucose during
exercise. In our third aim, we will assess the safety and usability of our decision support engine in a small
proof-of-concept study with human participants, supported by the Sponsor. This will be the first decision
support system specifically designed to provide treatment recommendations that help users maintain safe
glucose levels while performing aerobic and resistance exercise."

Developmental transitions are often depicted as highly buffered processes that lead from one
stereotypical state to a different stereotypical state. Changes in the relative timing of different
processes can have profound consequences for the viability of an organism and, on a longer
time scale, for the evolution of a species. The juvenile-to-adult transition in plants (vegetative
phase change) is an ideal system in which to study the mechanism and consequences of such
heterochronic variation. Compared to other developmental transitions in plants, vegetative
phase change is unusual in that it occurs relatively slowly and involves species-specific traits
that change gradually from leaf-to-leaf at slightly different rates. As a result, novel combinations
of traits are the rule, rather than the exception. This process is controlled by two closely-related
miRNAs, miR156 and miR157. miR156/157 are expressed at high levels early in shoot
development, but then decline dramatically, relieving the repression of their targets, SPL
transcription factors. We hypothesize the plasticity of vegetative phase change is attributable to
1) the functional differentiation of SPL genes; 2) the differential sensitivity of these genes to
miR156/157 and 3) natural variation in the level and/or expression pattern of miR156/miR157.
We will test this hypothesis in Arabidopsis thaliana by (Aim 1) characterizing the effect of loss-
of-function mutations in 6 key SPL genes on gene expression and leaf morphology. The
sensitivity of these genes to variation in the level of miR156/miR157 will be examined using
transgenic lines containing miR156-sensitive reporters. In Aim 2, we will characterize natural
variation in the expression pattern of miR156 and use QTL mapping to identify the genes
responsible for this variation. In Aim 3, we will perform a sensitized genetic screen to identify
mutations that increase the abundance of miR156 or interfere with its down-regulation, and will
determine the molecular identity of these mutations by whole genome sequencing of mutants in
segregating populations. In addition to contributing to an understanding of the molecular
mechanism and biological functions of vegetative phase change, these experiments address the
more general question of whether miRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression facilitates
developmental plasticity."

 Collagen crosslinking (CXL) using single photon, 380 nm, UVA light to photoactivate riboflavin (Rf) is
known to induce a two-fold increase in collagen stiffness and 1-3 diopters of corneal flattening. While these
effects have been shown to have significant therapeutic benefits for both treating Keratoconus and correcting
minor refractive errors, there are several major drawbacks to this procedure, including post-operative pain and
and delayed visual recovery with increased risk of bacterial infection and corneal scaring. In our recently
completed, NEI funded research project we developed a two-photon, nonlinear optical (NLO) CXL approach
using infrared femtosecond laser (FS) light that limits Rf photoactivation to the two-photon focal volume of an
objective lens. This device uses an amplified FS laser to generate 760 nm, 0.3 μJ pulses at less than 46.1
mW total power (under the ANSI thermal limit for laser eye exposure), and can crosslink a 4 mm diameter area
in less than 4 min, significantly enhance stromal stiffness 1.6 fold, and induce 1 to 2 diopters of corneal
flattening in live rabbits. As part of this project, we have also developed a novel, FS laser based, corneal
epithelial micromachining approach to create Microchannels (MicroCh) through the epithelium to greatly
enhance transepithelial (TE) Rf diffusion. Goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that post-operative pain
and delayed visual recovery is due to the excessive cellular damage caused by UVA CXL and that TE-NLO
CXL shows significantly less cell damage with faster visual recovery. This hypothesis will be tested through
the following specific aims: Aim 1. Optimize MicroCh TE Rf stromal penetration by determining the effects of
pulse energy, density and depth on Rf stromal concentration and epithelial/stromal integrity as compared to
other excipient TE approaches using ex vivo rabbit eyes. Aim 2. Determine the effects of TE Rf penetration
on corneal epithelial and stromal integrity comparing MicroCh to optimal excipient Rf approaches identified in
SA1 using an ex vivo rabbit eye model to measure epithelial/stromal cell death and induced inflammatory gene
expression at 3 hours and 24 hours with and without UVA or NLO CXL. Aim 3. Determine the effects MicroCh
Rf delivery and UVA versus NLO CXL in live rabbits by assessing the effects on epithelial integrity, corneal
sensitivity, stromal inflammation, wound healing and visual recovery."
10824324,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Craniosynostosis is a craniofacial disorder characterized by the premature fusion of cranial sutures with
defective mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Patients with severe craniosynostosis often have intellectual
disabilities (IDs). Both genetic mutations and environmental factors have been linked to craniosynostosis
coupled with MSC depletion. We propose to determine gene-environment interaction mechanisms in
craniosynostosis by addressing how craniosynostosis disease genes Twist1 and Tcf12 interplay with an
environmental risk factor, namely maternal usage of the antidepressant citalopram. Importantly, we aim to
establish a MSC-based therapeutic strategy to mitigate both skull dysmorphology and neurocognitive
dysfunctions in craniosynostosis. This is innovative and significant because we have little understanding of
environmental factors and gene-environment interactions in craniosynostosis, and new treatments for this
devastating disorder are urgently needed. Neurocognitive functions have been largely neglected in studies of
animal models of craniosynostosis, although cognitive abnormalities such as IDs have been frequently
observed in craniosynostosis patients. The only current treatment option for craniosynostosis is complex
surgery, which is invasive and often requires re-operation due to the calvarial bones fusing again. Our MSC-
based cranial suture regeneration approach is less invasive, avoids re-fusion, corrects skull dysmorphology,
restores elevated intracranial pressure, and reduces neurocognitive dysfunctions later in life in a clinically
relevant Twist1+/- mouse model of craniosynostosis. Gli1+ MSC depletion is observed both in Twist1+/- mice and
in those with maternal exposure to citalopram. Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI),
which is the most commonly prescribed class of antidepressant drugs. Maternal SSRI usage is also known as
an environmental risk factor for craniosynostosis in humans. These results lead to the hypothesis that Twist1
and Tcf12 mutations may interplay with citalopram in exacerbating skull and neurocognitive defects in
craniosynostosis, which will be tested in Aim 1. Aim 2 will determine cellular and molecular mechanisms by
which gene mutations and maternal citalopram exposure act together to cause craniosynostosis. Aim 3 will use
our newly developed MSC-based suture regeneration approach to determine whether and how MSC
implantation mitigates skull and neurocognitive dysfunctions in craniosynostosis caused by gene mutations,
citalopram, and their interactions. Collectively, our proposed studies build upon our previous discoveries, and
our findings will be highly significant for improving the understanding of mechanisms underlying gene-
environment interplay in craniosynostosis; it offers a unique opportunity for improving treatment of infants with
craniosynostosis."

This is a renewal application for the Summer HIV/AIDS Research Program (SHARP) at the San Francisco
Department of Public Health (SFDPH). SHARP is a summer-long research experience for undergraduate
students who are underrepresented minorities (URMs) in science and medicine. SHARP aims to enhance
the diversity of the scientific workforce by training undergraduates to be a part of a community of scientists
dedicated to substance use and HIV research. Over the next five years, SHARP, grounded in Social
Cognitive Career Theory, will engage URM students in an applied research program to prepare them for
graduate or medical school, and ultimately, choose HIV and substance use-focused careers. The renewed
SHARP will build on a highly successful program launched in 2012 that integrates research, mentoring,
training, shadowing, and networking opportunities and add new program enhancements to facilitate strong
mentor-mentee relationships. In addition to recruiting potential SHARP scholars from local Bay Area colleges
and universities, we will add new strategies to recruit from Historic Black Colleges and Universities and
minority serving institutions throughout the country through direct outreach and leverage our established and
growing national network of career mentors. The 12-week summer program will select six scholars each
year. SHARP scholars will conduct an HIV and substance-use focused research project, aligned with
National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) scientific priorities, under the close supervision of highly engaged
SHARP mentor teams comprised of senior and junior investigators who will receive enhanced training to
support their scholars. Scholars will participate in weekly seminars and eLearning covering research
methods, state-of-the-science HIV and substance use topics, the responsible conduct of research, rigor and
reproducibility, and professional skills, including public speaking and manuscript writing. Scholars will have
the opportunity to shadow research staff and engage in Photovoice – a digital storytelling method to capture
the scholars experience as a URM in research. Scholars will receive faculty and peer mentorship and be
linked to a cadre of career mentors from NIDA-supported URM investigators at the University of California,
San Francisco, and other academic institutions across the country. The summer will culminate in a SHARP
Research Symposium where scholars will present their research findings. To retain interest over time and
track outcomes, we are launching a new eNewsletter, webinars, and works-in-progress sessions for alumni
and establishing a social network and new learning management system to host SHARP curricular content.
Moreover, alumni will be encouraged to submit abstracts for presentation at local and national conferences
and prepare manuscripts for peer review. The SFDPH is a rich research environment, suitable to host a
program poised to attract the next generation of equity-focused substance use and HIV researchers."
10627025,"Since 1992, MD Anderson Cancer Prevention Education: Student Research Experiences has
provided short-term experiences in cancer prevention research and education to attract students to careers in
cancer prevention research. We recruit undergraduate, graduate, and health professional students from the
basic biomedical sciences, biostatistics, epidemiology, genetics, behavioral and social sciences, nursing,
medicine, pharmacy, and related public health disciplines. Beginning with 10 positions in 1992 and increasing
over time, the Program now supports 25 positions annually. Other than pandemic shutdown-year 2020, to
date, all positions have been filled annually. The Advisory Committee reviews and selects the students based
on the merit of their academic performance, educational objectives, and research interests. The Specific Aims
are to recruit nationally and train 25 high-performing students for 10-week positions annually, using
innovative and effective strategies to attract a demographically diverse student population; to cultivate and
support our pool of mentors; to provide a superlative mentored research training experience in a variety of
cancer prevention disciplines; to provide career and professional skills development and research ethics; to
broaden participation in research careers through development of students’ identity as scientists; and to
rigorously evaluate the Program’s value and effectiveness, tracking students’ career trajectories long-term.
Around the Program’s centerpiece of mentored research in cancer prevention designed by faculty with student
learning objectives, we provide a structured curriculum covering topics in cancer prevention and control and
application of these principles in practice; exposure to many career paths into the field and methods for career
exploration and decision-making; and other professional development activities with strong emphasis on
career navigation skills development. Although this specialized curriculum has had long-term success, in part
from adding over time many innovative educational activities, in this renewal, we will refine the curriculum,
strengthening engagement with cancer prevention and control principles and research while continuing to
improve and evaluate new components that are designed to increase self-awareness and strengthen defense
strategies against negative conditions detrimental to learning, personal well-being, and achieving career goals
(e.g., impostor feelings, fixed ability mindset, perceived discrimination), helping students navigate and persist
in those career paths successfully. Linking personal values and themes in research and cancer prevention
accumulated over 10-weeks with the value of pursuing careers in the field will serve as a way to extend and
intensify interest in such careers after the end of the Program. Overall, the Program’s success takes many
forms, from recruitment of a highly diverse student population, to students’ development of research products
suitable for publication, and also a large number of alumni who have advanced in cancer prevention from
graduate school to faculty and other independent research and leadership positions."
10911781,"Project Summary/Abstract
In cancer research, the need for a diverse pool of researchers in statistics and data science has never been
greater. Yet, the requisite academic pipeline for training such a workforce remains inadequate. Minority
students admitted to statistics or biostatistics graduate programs are confronted with lack of diversity at the
faculty level, and, frequently, lack of awareness by faculty of ways to best support them.
Explanations for the lack of faculty diversity in science are multifactorial, but two key drivers are the lack of
inclusion frequently felt by racial and ethnic minority students, and the pipeline problem reflected by the low
number of doctoral graduates from these historically marginalized groups. The driving objective of
GROWS@FredHutch (Generating Research Opportunities Within Statistics at Fred Hutch) is to simultaneously
tackle these obstacles. To address the pipeline problem, we will develop and implement a new summer
mentored research program for undergraduates who identify as underrepresented minorities. The program will
offer: (1) an engaging and supportive mentored research experience that increases their awareness of and
interest in pursuing careers in cancer statistics and data science research and (2) career development,
community building, and social/emotional support activities. Our goal is that students will not only gain skills
and confidence in cancer statistics and data science, but they will feel a sense of belonging and rightful place
in the statistics and cancer research communities. The program will also provide coaching to faculty mentors to
optimize their chances of success and confidence in mentoring students and will engage faculty in activities
that build community.
The specific objectives of GROWS@FredHutch are: (1) Educate: through intensive training in R programming
and statistics via an introductory didactic program followed by ongoing reinforcement and support; (2) Engage:
via carefully crafted mentored cancer statistics projects; (3) Enable: through career development workshops
and a role-model program; (4) Endure: foster ongoing connection and support students in pursuing research
careers in the field via activities to build community and sense of belonging and career support post program.
In addition, we propose to offer a program for faculty mentors that will improve mentoring skills, build
confidence in supervising students from historically marginalized groups, and increase awareness of the
importance of fostering a sense of belonging and rightful presence for these students.
The Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center offers a world-renowned cancer research environment and
scientific faculty, prioritizes training the next generation of cancer researchers, and is strongly committed to
diversity, equity, and inclusion. The Puget Sound area is home to a large immigrant community and a diverse
set of minority cultures, which will be targeted for recruitment via a well-honed diversity recruitment plan
bolstered by longstanding community partnerships."

Individuals trained in both data science and genomics are essential to fully realizing the plethora
of data at the intersection of genomics and biomedicine. Additionally, diversity in the genomics
workforce is necessary to support creativity, the study of conditions in underrepresented groups,
and ensure that research performed is generalizable and beneficial to all people. Here, we
propose the Pathways in Genomic Data Science (PATH-GDS) research experience program for
MS Statistics and MS Applied Mathematics students within the Department of Mathematical and
Statistical Sciences at the University of Colorado Denver (CU Denver). CU Denver is uniquely
positioned with two campuses: the Downtown Campus with undergraduate programs and close
proximity to diverse recruiting institutions, and the Anschutz Medical Campus with world
renowned biomedical and human genomics research. In PATH-GDS we will: (1) recruit scholars
from diverse groups underrepresented in biomedical and genomics research; (2) train
quantitative MS students from diverse backgrounds in genomics research and career skills; and
(3) create, support, and retain a diverse data science genomics community. In doing so, we will
build and support a diverse data science genomics community within Colorado, the Mountain
West, and beyond."

 This project focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the
coupled translocation of mRNA and tRNAs during protein synthesis. It includes the important
related problems of how the translational reading frame is preserved (or shifted) and how the
ribosomal helicase unwinds structured mRNAs. Our laboratory uniquely uses a combination of
biochemistry, structural biology, genetics, FRET and computational methods to address these
challenging problems. We are also extending our approaches to include single-molecule optical
tweezer methods, in collaboration with the Bustamante laboratory (UC Berkeley) and single-
molecule FRET, in collaboration with the Ermolenko laboratory (Univ. of Rochester), as well as
cryo-electron microscopy, in collaboration with the Chiu laboratory (Stanford/SLAC).
 In previous studies, we have determined the structures of trapped translocation
intermediates, which have provided unexpected insights into how the movements of mRNA and
tRNA through the ribosome are coupled to large- and small-scale conformational changes in the
structure of the ribosome itself. We then created FRET pairs that allowed us to correlate
intersubunit rotation, movement of the L1 stalk and rotation of the 30S subunit head domain with
movements of mRNA and tRNA. We plan to extend this search to discover new intermediate
states. Having exhausted previous strategies for trapping translocation intermediates, we will
use a new approach which exploits a set of dominant-lethal mutations in all five structural
domains of elongation factor EF-G that we expect will block translocation at different steps.
 Development of a novel fluorescent labeling approach that will allow site-specific labeling
of FRET pairs directly to ribosomal RNA will overcome technical barriers to single-molecule
studies of ribosome dynamics, including studies using simultaneous measurement of molecular
forces and FRET changes in the ribosome, in collaboration with the Bustamante group. Finally,
we have designed model structured mRNAs that will provide the basis for studying the
mechanism of the mRNA helicase and for determination of the structures of translocation
complexes stalled in the act of encountering and unwinding an mRNA helix.

10922670,"ABSTRACT
Engineered cell therapies are becoming a pillar of medicine, along with molecular and genetic interventions. In
particular, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies have had a number of FDA approvals in the last 5
years targeting hematologic malignancies. To extend the success of these therapies, especially for the treatment
of solid tumors, a more thorough understanding of how CAR structure is linked to CAR-T cell function is
necessary. Notably, widespread tools to analyze and select single CAR-T cells from a large population based
on functional properties, such as secreted products or cytolytic activity, are critically lacking. Single-cell functional
assays can enable screening a library of CAR designs introduced into a pool of cells to identify rare functional
cells and sort these cells to recover CAR designs associated with important effector functions. If conducted in
high throughput, thousands of constructs can be screened with hundreds of individual events per construct to
have robust statistical accuracy in the linkage between function and sequence. In addition, if single-cell functional
information can be tied to transcriptomic information, pathway analysis associated with strong effector functions
can be performed, identifying other gene targets that improve function, even in the presence of
immunosuppressive, exhaustion-prone, or other microenvironments associated with solid tumors. Partillion’s
nanovial technology provides a new approach to measure the function of single cells using widely available
fluorescence activated cell sorters (FACS) and single-cell sequencing instruments, which we aim to apply to cell
therapy discovery. Here, we propose to develop single-cell secretion and cell-killing assays compatible with the
nanovials to introduce a new product that would enable scaled cell therapy discovery workflows from millions of
cells. We aim to identify optimal nanovial formulations and procedures to measure both cytokine production and
cytolytic functions from the same cells, and then link single-cell transcriptomic information with this functional
readout. We also will engineer nanovials to better recapitulate the tumor microenvironment, acting as an artificial
antigen-presenting target cell with combinations of antigen and immunosuppressive signals. The approach
should be applicable broadly beyond CAR-T cell therapies to other chimeric receptors in natural killer cells, and
macrophages, or in finding engineered T cell receptors. Ultimately, more access to sophisticated cell selection
approaches can lead to therapies that are both lower in price and more effective as well as expanding the scope
of applications to un-explored therapeutic areas."
10890624,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic
neurons. Currently about one million people live with PD in the United States, and as the risk of developing PD
increases with age and the population of the elderly is increasing, the number of people suffering from this
disease is expected to grow in the future. Developing targeted treatments that slow or halt disease progression
will not only improve patient quality of life, but would also reduce the vast economic burden on society.
LRRK2 G2019S is the most common missense mutation found in PD, and several organisms, including
Drosophila, have been used to model LRRK2-mediated neurodegeneration. LRRK2 G2019S alters neurite
morphology in vitro, and by expressing LRRK2 G2019S in the dopaminergic neurons of flies, we have recently
shown that it induces an age-dependent reduction of neurite length and branching in vivo, prior to overt
neuronal loss. Recent advances in Parkinson's disease research have revealed that PD not only affects
neurons, but also the function of glial cells, rendering them unable to fulfill their physiological role in
maintaining tissue homeostasis and facilitating neuronal transmission. Investigating the precise role phagocytic
glia and astrocytes play in neurite loss and neuronal death is key to fully understanding the mechanisms
leading to neurodegeneration. In Aim 1 of this proposal I will examine whether glial function if altered in aging
mutant LRRK2–expressing flies. In Aim 2 I will evaluate whether inhibiting glial function affects neurite loss,
neuronal death, and motor function across age in LRRK2 G2019S flies, and whether LRRK2 G2019S in the
glia leads to or exacerbates neurodegeneration. In Aim 3 I will examine if morphological changes in neurite
architecture result in functional changes at the synapse, and whether this phenotype is sensitive to glial
activity: I will evaluate the number of synapses across age in LRRK2 G2019S flies, and using a functional
imaging approach determine if neurite loss translates into alterations in synaptic function. The proposed
studies will examine the relationship between neurite morphology, synaptic function, and glial phagocytic
activity, and offer mechanistic insight into the role of glia in pathology. The results will provide a foundation for
future research into novel interventions against PD development and progression."
10932643,"RESEARCH SUMMARY
The human genome encodes more than 1,600 transcription factors (TFs), along with additional
cofactors, chromatin regulators, and structural proteins that collectively execute the regulatory
instructions encoded within the nuclear DNA. Dysfunctions of these proteins are known to drive
multiple diseases such as cancer, inflammation-related, and neurological conditions. In cancer,
these proteins are frequently amplified or overexpressed to drive a gene expression program
that facilitates the initiation and progression of various types of leukemia, sarcoma and other
tumors. Despite the importance of these proteins, TFs have been considered undruggable due
to challenges in modeling their activity in vitro. We have solved these shortcomings by
implementing an in-cell functional proteomics drug discovery platform that quantifies the effects
of small-molecules on the abundance of TF bound to the genome in a diversity of cell and tissue
types. The platform is based on Chromatin Extraction by Salt Separation, coupled to Data
Independent Analysis mass spectrometry (ChESS-DIA), which was recently reported. In this
proposal, we adapt this technology to enable the discovery of covalent small molecule inhibitors,
a type of chemistry that has recently enabled targeting of the previously undruggable KRAS
protein. First, we will compare the efficacy of several different covalent screening approaches in
combination with ChESS-DIA proteome analysis, determining which strategy is best for
compound discovery. Computational tools will also be built to robustly identify functional
covalent hit compounds, and to identify the compound:protein adducts that are formed upon
compound binding. Several well-characterized covalent inhibitors will be used to validate the
accuracy of these methods. With a validated covalent screening TF assay, we will then optimize
a secondary assay using intact protein to verify that hit compounds can label target proteins in a
stoichiometric, specific way. With these tools in hand, we will then perform a pilot screen to
prove the assay’s utility in a discovery setting, using a subset of a commercial covalent
compound library. These compounds contain a diverse array of reactive warheads, and this will
allow us to understand various performance metrics of the optimized assay. This data package
will enable us to perform full-scale internal screens for compounds that target Talus’ TFs of
interest, as well as provide the foundation for business development discussions with biotech
and pharmaceutical companies interested in TF inhibition."
10772004,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Depression and anxiety are associated with overlapping dysfunctions in emotion processing, but the etiology is
not well understood. Individual differences during infancy in negative temperament—a global measure of a
child’s emotional reactivity and regulation tendencies—are associated with increased risk for depression and
anxiety. Thus, the emotional dysfunction linked to depression and anxiety appears to begin during early
infancy, yet the associated developmental neurobiology is poorly understood. A central barrier to unlocking the
developmental neurobiology of emotion dysfunction is we do not know how variation in brain function at birth
relates to emotion processing later in infancy, and whether this relation depends on infant temperament.
Contextualized emotion processing—processing emotions in the real-world, with competing stimuli and full
narrative context—is complex and includes: 1) detection of and attention towards salient stimuli; 2)
interpretation and contextualization of this information; and 3) making a behavioral response. Depression and
anxiety have been associated with dysfunctions at all three stages, and emerging evidence suggesting that
some of these dysfunctions are present at birth. Recent work has found that the variation in newborn brain
activation during saliency processing—the first stage of emotion processing—is associated with risk for
anxiety. While this links early variation in saliency processing to risk trajectories for anxiety and depression, the
developmental sequence is unknown. This study is therefore designed to identify how neonatal brain function
is associated with contextualized emotion processing during infancy. This project will add an additional
measure to the ongoing Neonatal Predictors of Anxiety Disorders Study (N-PAD; R01MH122389 PI: Sylvester,
sponsor), a longitudinal study of mothers and infants. This current grant will substantially increase the impact of
the parent grant by adding a video-watching eye-tracking task to the 24-month assessment, allowing us to
measure attention to contextualized emotional stimuli. Our central hypothesis is that neonatal activation to
salient stimuli (measured with fMRI) predicts attention to contextualized emotional stimuli during
infancy (measured with eye tracking), and this relation is strengthened in infants with negative
temperaments. Results will provide important insights to how internalizing symptoms emerge across early
development. Through this project, the candidate will develop critical expertise in infant neural and behavioral
assessments."

Left-right (LR) differences in size, shape and/or anatomical position exist in almost every organ system.
Consequently, abnormal LR asymmetry (known as heterotaxy, HTX) often leads to multiple, life threatening
birth defects involving complex malformations and discordant laterality between organs. While the early
embryonic events that establish global LR asymmetry have been well studied, it is the later-stage, organ-
specific LR asymmetric morphogenesis events that are critical for normal anatomy; yet, for most organs,
the molecular and cellular processes that sculpt their individual LR asymmetries have not been elucidated. This
application will explore the novel and surprising concept that LR asymmetries in GLYCOLYSIS—the
primordial metabolic pathway that breaks down glucose to generate ATP—are integrally involved in
asymmetric organ morphogenesis. Published work has shown that leftward curvature of the stomach, an
archetypical LR asymmetry conserved among vertebrates, depends on LR asymmetric rearrangements of
mesenchymal cells into an epithelium (mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition; MET), causing thinning and
expansion of the left stomach wall. Recent left vs right transcriptome profiling subsequently revealed that
glycolysis enzymes are upregulated in the left side of the stomach during curvature. As glycolysis (as
opposed to mitochondrial respiration) is known to promote epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in other contexts,
this unexpected finding raises the intriguing possibility that LR asymmetric glycolysis may facilitate the LR
asymmetric MET that drives curvature morphogenesis. In the proposed project, this idea will be rigorously
tested by exploiting the unique attributes of two different amphibian embryos, executing metabolomics, mass
spectrometry imaging, glycolytic flux analyses, pharmacological perturbations, and left- vs right-targeted tests
of gene function, to determine the function of glycolysis genes (Aim 1), and glycolytic metabolism (Aim 2) in
stomach curvature morphogenesis. Successful completion of this R21 will therefore substantiate the intriguing
premise that organ laterality is shaped by LR asymmetries in glycolysis, such that aberrant metabolic
states may contribute to the development of laterality-related birth defects."

The field of biomedical informatics continues to face an urgent need to expand the pipeline of talented
students to meet the increased demand for biomedical informatics and health data science expertise and
to improve diversity in the field. Nationally, there is increased awareness of the need to encourage future
generations to consider careers in STEM-C (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics,
including Computing). Exposure to biomedical informatics, in contrast to other STEM-C related
disciplines, generally occurs much later in training. The previous funding period was successful in
engaging 76 high school students from across the United States. The indirect positive impacts of this
program have resulted in a growth of biomedical informatics programs across the United States that
connect to high school students through summer internship experiences, curriculum partnerships with
high schools, and other outreach efforts. The long-term goal of this project remains to develop a
sustainable national forum for showcasing biomedical informatics research projects led by high school
scholars. To this end, this conference grant aims to: (1) Enhance the now-established AMIA High School
Scholars Program to amplify learning experiences about the field, disseminate knowledge gained in
research experiences, and interact with peers from other institutions; (2) Increase knowledge, mentoring,
and engagement opportunities for high school scholars by creating multi-tiered mentoring; and (3)
Engage the biomedical informatics community to develop extensions of biomedical informatics education
and research opportunities at the high school level. The success of this initiative will continue to provide
unique opportunities for high school students who may enter STEM-C career paths and further
development a national pipeline of talent to meet the growing needs of biomedical informatics and data
science across the United States."
10749910,"Abstract. Dysphagia is a significant health problem associated with aging, contributing to hospitalization for
malnutrition, dehydration, frailty, falls, and pneumonia. By 2030, the US elderly population is anticipated to
exceed 72 million with over 12 million of these individuals considered to be experiencing swallowing difficulties.
Despite the high incidence and prevalence of dysphagia, particularly in the adult aging population, there is no
uniform definition of adult dysphagia. Instead, heterogenous definitions in the extant literature pave the way for
ambiguity and philosophical differences among dysphagia experts and other key stakeholders. Establishing an
accepted and cogent definition for dysphagia is a critical step in quantifying the exact magnitude of disease in
a specific population, and assuring accuracy and consistency across healthcare settings, researchers, third
party payers, and other key stakeholders. The goal of this proposal is to convene two multidisciplinary
conferences to develop and derive a cohesive definition for dysphagia in the aged population. This application
is to request support for the Dysphagia: In Search of a Unified Definition for the Aging Population conference.
This unique, multidisciplinary endeavor will leverage experts from numerous specialty areas, including
gerontology, critical care, otolaryngology, gastroenterology, pulmonology, bioengineering, nursing, nutrition,
and speech-language pathology, to converge and through evidence-based synthesis and discussion agree
upon an accepted definition for dysphagia across the domains of screening, diagnosis, treatment,
management and ongoing care. The specific aims of this conference are to engage experts and key
stakeholders who work with older adults with dysphagia and to collaborate and develop a consensus validation
for a unified definition of dysphagia and guidelines that can be applied for use in clinical patient populations,
public health, and policy. This work is imperative and long overdue given the continued “greying of America”,
and that the majority of the literature in swallowing and swallowing disorders is <40 years old. The culmination
of this project will result in data driven consensus statement for evaluation, replication, and/or endorsement by
international institutions. The resulting definition and guideline will also be employed to develop a multi-site
clinical study (R01) incorporating this new definition to promote best care, and test adherence and coding
accuracy within the medical record. This work will provide uniformity in the literature and throughout the
healthcare landscape, driving informed decision making, diagnostic accuracy, targeted treatment, and
early prevention of dysphagia in aged persons to reduce the burden of complications and in turn
health care cost."

 Structural variations (SVs), including inversions, deletions, duplications, and translocations, are
prevalent in cancer and other diseases. It has been shown recently that SVs can disrupt the 3D genome
structure and directly contribute to pathogenesis. For example, in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, deletion
of a TAD boundary disrupted the insulated chromatin domains and activates proto-oncogenes. Two main
consequences of SVs on 3D genome structures are the formations of “neo-TADs” and “enhancer-hijacking.”
Neo-TADs refers to the scenarios when a SV event leads to the formation new chromatin domains, particularly
in the cancer genomes, while enhancer-hijacking means when a SV event rearranges the cancer genome and
juxtaposes an enhancer to the proximity of an oncogene.
 3D genome organization has been shown to be essential in proper gene regulation and cell fate.
Previous studies have shown that mammalian genomes are organized in megabase pair topologically
associating domains (TADs). Genes located within the same TADs tend to be co-regulated and the functions of
enhancers are usually restrained by TADs boundaries. Both genetic and epigenetic alteration of TADs
boundaries can lead to gene misregulation and severe human diseases. To study the 3D genome
organization, Hi-C is by far the most popular method, as it can measure chromatin interactions genome-wide. It
facilitates the original discovery of TADs and many enhancer-promoter interactions. Recently, Hi-C has been
applied to tens of cancer cell lines and a small number of patient samples. However, to our knowledge, no
methods exist that can identify neo-TADs or enhancer-hijacking events using the Hi-C interaction data in
cancer cells.
 Therefore, in this study, we propose the following aims: 1) Develop computational method to detect
neo-TADs in cancer genome; 2) Develop computational method to detect chromatin interactions in cancer
genomes; 3) Perform validation experiments for the hijacked enhancers by CRISPR/Cas9 and investigate
their effect on target genes and cell phenotypes."

The objective of this project is to extend the C. elegans genetic toolkit available to researchers by providing
publicly available gene knockout (KO) mutations in genes of high value to those interested in human biology
and disease. C. elegans is a proven model for discovery of gene function and for embedding genes into
functional pathways, many of which were discovered in this transparent animal and are conserved in humans.
Loss-of-function mutations are the gold-standard for genetic analysis and allow inferences of gene function and
interaction. A relatively recent trend is that large-scale screens (e.g., RNA-seq, proteomics, natural variation
studies) generate long candidate gene lists for researchers to sort through and functionally validate, requiring
loss of function mutants in many genes to be examined. Having a community-driven resource generate KOs in
such genes provides reproducibility and an economy of scale that benefits all. We have developed an efficient
and high throughput CRISPR-Cas9 based gene knockout (KO) project to provide a set of precisely edited gene
knockout strains to the communities of C. elegans researchers and human geneticists. We seek to continue
the production phase of this project, thereby transformatively increasing the efficiency and impact of C. elegans
molecular genetics. We employ a highly coordinated three-site production strategy to generate KOs. Each
gene edit is carefully confirmed, and validated strains are grossly phenotyped and deposited into the
Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC) strain collection along with detailed strain information for distribution to
the community. Strains are advertised through both the CGC and WormBase websites. We have generated
over 1,000 KOs to date; these KOs have supported a variety of research projects – spanning from mechanistic
studies of human variants to metabolomics – funded by at least 14 NIH Institutes and Centers, demonstrating
the high impact of our resource. We propose to continue to use our established pipelines to target an additional
2500 C. elegans orthologs of human genes. We will prioritize known or suspected human disease genes,
druggable gene classes, as well as understudied genes that are conserved to humans but that have no
actionable information. This is a multi-PI project which includes the lead-PIs of the CGC and of WormBase and
a subcontractor who maintains multiple community-centered databases, including a CRISPR guide RNA
selection site."

The voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.5 controls cardiac excitability and is an established therapeutic target.
Mutations in the SCN5A gene, which encodes NaV1.5, are associated with inherited arrhythmia syndromes (long
QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, congenital heart block) and dilated cardiomyopathy. While gain of function
mutations that disrupt NaV1.5 inactivation explain action potential duration (APD) and QTc prolongation, the
mechanisms by which loss of function NaV1.5 mutations cause the other diverse pathogenic outcomes are
unresolved. The physiological significance of other Na+ channel genes expressed in the heart are also uncertain.
Rodent models with gene-targeted Scn5a mutations can recapitulate some clinical features of disease, but their
use is complicated by compensatory mechanisms that may occur early in development. In addition, the available
pharmacological blockers of NaV1.5 block brain Na+ channels and other potential cardiac Na+ channels with
equal or greater potency, limiting their utility. In order to advance our understanding of NaV1.5-related biology,
we have developed a chemical-genetic model to achieve acute and reversible silencing of NaV1.5 in situ. We
engineered a NaV1.5 channel that contains a high-affinity, isoform-specific binding site for acylsulfonamide (GX)
drugs, enabling chemical strategies to pharmacologically drive nonconducting channel conformations. The
NaV1.5-GX channel has WT voltage-dependent gating and, unlike WT NaV1.5 and most other putative cardiac
Na+ channels, is blocked by nanomolar concentrations of GX compounds. We have used CRISPR gene-editing
to replace the endogenous Scn5a locus with the GX binding site in mice, creating a novel NaV1.5GX strain.
Homozygous NaV1.5GX/GX mice have normal cardiac phenotypes, yet the acute application of nanomolar GX
compounds to NaV1.5GX/GX isolated cardiac myocytes ablates Na+ current (INa). Systemic drug application in vivo
results in conduction slowing in NaV1.5GX/WT mice, and conduction block and sudden death in NaV1.5GX/GX mice,
thus providing a facile means to study NaV1.5 function and SCN5A-mediated disease. We propose first to
examine the effects of acute Nav1.5 blockade by GX compounds on gene expression, Ca2+ handling, ROS
production, fibrosis, cardiac function and arrythmias will be studied using NaV1.5GX/WT and NaV1.5GX/GX cardiac
myocytes and mice, and compared to chronic Nav1.5 blockade using Scn5a+/- heterozygous knockout mice. We
will then identify the effects of Na+ channel blockade on structural and electrophysiological remodeling, and on
arrhythmia susceptibility following Transverse Aortic Constriction (TAC). Lastly, we will develop in vivo and ex
vivo platforms to study SCN5A mutations identified in patients. The Scn5aGX mouse presents a unique
opportunity to examine the phenotypes of human SCN5A mutations in a cardiac environment. In total, we
anticipate these efforts will reveal novel molecular mechanisms of genotype-phenotype coupling stemming from
SCN5A's role in controlling cardiac excitability."

 Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States; however, the genetic causes
and molecular mechanisms underlying these medical conditions have yet to be thoroughly elucidated. As a result,
the identification of new therapeutic targets for the effective treatment of these diseases is urgently required.
Because the majority of the genome is actively transcribed to produce a vast number of non-coding RNA
transcripts, this project is focused on determining the role of long non-coding RNAs in heart disease, which is an
understudied and important area of investigation. Thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are
defined as non-coding RNA transcripts greater than 200 nucleotides in length, have been found to have biological
activity in humans and other organisms; they are considered novel regulatory molecules of numerous
physiological and pathological processes, including those in the cardiovascular system. Our earlier RNA-seq
studies identified many differentially expressed lncRNAs in the hearts of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
One of these lncRNAs, known as large intergenic non-coding RNA-p21 (lincRNA-p21), was previously shown to
be a transcriptional target of tumor protein p53 and a novel regulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis. More
recently, it has been implicated in the control of the regulation of vascular remodeling responses in
atherosclerosis. However, the function of lincRNA-p21 in the heart and cardiac disease remains unknown.
 We propose to examine the function of lincRNA-p21 in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cardiac
regeneration. Our preliminary data using mutant mouse lines demonstrates that lincRNA-p21 is also involved in
cardiac remodeling in response to pathophysiological stress. Therefore, the overall goal of this application is to
clearly define the function and molecular mechanisms of lincRNA-p21 in the heart. We propose to do this by
pursuing the following Specific Aims: 1) to systematically study the in vivo function of lincRNA-p21 in the
heart using gain- and loss-of-function mouse models, 2) to define the molecular mechanisms by which lincRNA-
p21 regulates cardiac remodeling by testing the hypothesis that this lncRNA alters cardiac function by affecting
the expression and function of Kap1/Trim28-dependent genes, and 3) to examine the therapeutic potential of
lincRNA-p21 in treating cardiomyopathy using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to either overexpress, or
AAV/gapmers to knockdown this lncRNA, in mice with cardiomyopathy. As a result, this proposal will
systematically and rigorously assess the role of lincRNA-p21 in heart disease and establish the molecular
mechanisms underlying the function of this intriguing lncRNA. The information obtained from these studies are
anticipated to identify important new molecular targets for the therapeutic treatment of cardiac disease."

The opioid epidemic is a continuously growing problem in the United States and across the world. It has profound
personal, social, and economic consequences. Opioid use can become Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) in many
individuals. OUD consists of several stages, one of which is a highly dysphoric withdrawal syndrome known as
Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (OWS). The withdrawal symptoms, including sleep dysregulation, and fear of those
symptoms often contributes drastically to relapse. We do not currently understand all of the neurobiological
mechanisms underlying opioid withdrawal, nor how particular circuits are modified by opioid withdrawal. It is well
known, however, that two brain regions, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) and the ventral tegmental
area (VTA), are involved in some capacity. In the two aims of this proposal, the experiments will help to
understand how the pathway between these two regions is modified by opioid withdrawal. Our preliminary data
shows that the GABAergic neurons in the BNST are altered by withdrawal. BNSTGABA neurons make up the bulk
of the BNST neurons projecting to the VTA, where they synapse onto VTAGABA neurons, and have been
implicated in positive reinforcement. This project utilizes viral-manipulations, behavioral studies, and
electrophysiological examinations to carefully and specifically determine the effects of withdrawal in the BNST.
In the second portion of this proposal, the experiments are focused on the output of this pathway in the VTA as
well as a knockdown of this pathway to elucidate the role of this pathway in controlling behavior."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) are two disorders that share a high cost of
degraded life quality, high mortality, and poor prognosis. Recent evidence suggests that AUD is a risk factor for
AD though the exact relationship between the two disorders is unknown. The proposed study aims to elucidate
this relationship by determining which functional neuropathologies are associated with cognitive decline in AUD
and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a cognitive pathology which frequently precedes dementia. This
project will collect resting and task-based fMRI data from AUD participants and use existing data from MCI and
healthy controls (HC). The two task paradigms consist of an episodic memory encoding task and a spatial
working-memory task. The resting-state data will be used to extract the default mode network, the episodic
memory encoding task data will be used to extract the episodic memory network, and the spatial working-
memory task data will be used to extract the spatial working-memory network. Graph-theory metrics will
be used to characterize connectome profiles associated with cognitive impairment, as measured by Montreal
Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score. The primary hypotheses are that graph-theory features of the episodic
memory network and/or the default mode networks in healthy controls will show alterations in the AUD and
MCI group and that these alterations are associated with MoCA score. The exploratory hypothesis is that
graph-theory scores of the spatial working-memory network will be associated with MoCA score in AUD
subjects. If the hypotheses are confirmed it could provide initial evidence that AUD increases the risk of
AD through cognitive impairment that results from compounding mild pre-existing deficits in at-risk individuals.
Such evidence could guide future treatments for both disorders by elucidating novel treatment targets which
could stop or slow the progression of cognitive decline."

While progress has been made since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the spread of the virus still poses a
threat to school safety. There is a significant concern regarding viral transmission in K-12 schools as a result of
close social interactions between children, crowded institutional environments, high risk extracurricular activities,
and insufficient vaccination coverage. Children have close interactions with parents and other household
members who are active in all sectors of society. Keeping K-12 schools safe is crucial to minimizing community
transmission and restoring optimal societal functions.
COVID-19 is unlikely to become extinct due to the emergence of new variants, rapidly waning antibodies, COVID
behavioral fatigue, and low vaccination coverage. The challenges of prevention and control in K-12 schools
persist, from both the current pandemic and future respiratory threats. Our study anticipates next steps of
outbreak prevention and management, and the topics of study (i.e. vaccinations) are highly relevant to school
safety in this or future respiratory threats (COVID, influenza). We will examine the experience of K-12 schools
during the pandemic through the following aims:
Aim 1: Conduct a scoping review to identify and inventory the current research and evidence quality on the
impact of COVID-19 on K-12 schools
Aim 2: Investigate individual stakeholder- and school administrative-level experience and concerns regarding
vaccination and safety practices during the pandemic through research in local K-12 schools via stakeholder
longitudinal surveys (Aim 2A) and qualitative exploratory semi-structured interviews of school administrators
(Aim 2B).
Aim 3: Assess the implementation of a Hardware-Assisted Bluetooth-based Infection Tracking Device (HABIT)
in a high school setting through a mixed-method study. We will assess HABIT's implementation outcomes (ease
of use, interface, and satisfaction, acceptability, usefulness, coherence, setting, adherence, appropriateness) in
a K-12 school using qualitative focus group interviews with key stakeholders, survey responses, and HABIT
device usage data. We will present both the quantitative performance metrics and the qualitative contextualized
insights of HABIT implementation.
The proposal is the research component of a comprehensive training plan that is designed to provide a
foundation for my career as a physician-scientist through the Yale MD-PhD program. Through these aims, we
seek to provide insights that are essential for developing an integrated approach to keep both children and
teachers safe in the event of the current and future respiratory viral outbreaks and pandemics."

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a highly lethal cancer that arises from the bile ducts and is often diagnosed at
an advanced stage with very poor prognosis. Factors associated with development of CCA include
inflammatory conditions of the bile ducts such as congenital cysts, gallstones, primary sclerosing cholangitis
(PSC), chronic hepatitis from viral and other causes, and occupational exposure to toxins such as the organic
solvents dichloromethane and 1,2-dichloropropane. In parts of Asia, liver fluke infestations of the bile ducts are
a major risk factor. However, the majority of patients who develop CCA worldwide have no known major risk
factor. Based on epidemiologic studies, it appears that CCA risk is due to a combination of genetic and
environmental factors. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genetic susceptibility loci for
different cancer types, allowing development of risk models that can allow determination of an individual’s risk
of cancer. GWAS have also provided valuable information on the biological and molecular pathways that
contribute to risk of different cancers, allowing improved understanding of cancer development and progress in
cancer prevention and treatment. Because CCA is a relatively less common cancer, it has been difficult to study
large numbers of CCA patients and there have been no large CCA GWAS studies published, either for patients
with de novo CCA or for CCA developing in patients with PSC. Although PSC patients are up to 150 times
more likely to develop CCA than the general population, only 10-20% of PSC patients will progress to CCA.
Variation in the risk of CCA among PSC patients may be caused by a complex interplay between genetic and
environmental factors. Several studies indicate PSC has a strong genetic component; however, the impact of
genetic factors in PSC-related CCA development is yet to be elucidated. We hypothesize that different host
genetic variants are associated with CCA risk in de novo versus PSC-associated CCA cases. We have
developed a large multi-institutional and multi-national collaboration to identify gene variants associated with
CCA. The goal of this study is to use high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis of genomic
DNA from CCA patients and controls. In a first phase of the study, we have genotyped DNA from 2829 CCA
patients, including 2412 of European and 417 of Asian descent. Of the European descent cases, 197 were
PSC-associated. Comparing the results with controls from the PLCO cohort, we identified a variant in the HLA
region on chromosome 6 that reached genome wide significance. A number of additional regions showed
suggestive results. We now propose an expansion of this discovery phase to acquire, genotype and sequence
DNA from an additional 7,267 CCA patients to confirm the validity of these suggestive results. We are also
expanding recruitment efforts to enrich the cohort in samples from non-European patients. We will use
sophisticated statistical genetic methods to analyze the results from the multi-ethnic cohort. Whole exome
sequencing will also be used to identify rare variants associated with CCA."

Among the disparities faced by populations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are those related to tobacco use
and secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe). Two countries particularly impacted by tobacco use and SHSe are Armenia
(AM) and Georgia (GE), which represent the 11th and 6th highest smoking rates in men globally (51.5% and 55.5%,
respectively). However, smoking prevalence is much lower among women (1.8% and 7.8%). Notably, a primary source of
SHSe among children and most nonsmoking adults in many LMICs, including AM and GE, is the home. Smoke-free
homes (SFHs) can reduce SHSe, promote cessation, and possibly disrupt initiation; however, 61.4% of households in AM
and GE allow smoking in the home. Thus, promoting SFHs may be an innovative and relatively untapped strategy for
chronic disease prevention in these countries – and in other LMICs with high smoking rates. Research focused on
implementing evidence-based interventions (EBIs) offers unique opportunities to address the pressing needs in LMICs
and to examine key barriers in the adoption, scale-up, and sustainment of EBIs in low-resource settings. This proposal
builds on ongoing collaborations among MPIs Berg and Kegler, the GE National Center for Disease Control (NCDC), the
AM National Institute of Health (NIH), and the American University of Armenia (AUA), dating back to 2013. These
collaborations have established: 1) a strong community-based infrastructure for implementing public health programs
using local coalitions in 14 communities, developed in our current Fogarty-funded R01; and 2) a theory-based SFHs
intervention, designed to be brief and adaptable and shown to be effective, generalizable, scalable, and cost-effective
among low-income households in the US. The current proposal will strategically capitalize on our strong partnerships
with national public health agencies, local community mobilization infrastructure, and SFH EBI to address our specific
aims. Aim 1: We will adapt our SFH intervention to be culturally appropriate for the AM and GE populations, using a
community-engaged approach and robust adaptation frameworks and methods, and develop in-country capacity for
intervention dissemination (via local coalitions) and delivery (via national quitlines). Aim 2: We will examine the
effectiveness of the adapted intervention (vs. control) on SFH adoption (primary outcome) among households in AM and
GE, using a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation RCT (n=550 participants; 275/country), with follow-up
assessments at 3 and 6 months. Aim 3: We will assess intervention reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance
potential, as well as related contextual influences, using a mixed-methods process evaluation guided by RE-AIM. Our
team (including national public health agencies) will use these findings to develop a sustainability and dissemination plan
(e.g., intervention packaging for scale-up). This work will provide a robust model for adapting and implementing this EBI
for AM and GE, which could then be used for this intervention in other countries and/or for other behavioral targets and
EBIs in AM, GE, and elsewhere. This work will advance our long-term goals of building the knowledge base informing
strategies to reduce tobacco-related disparities globally and the implementation and scale-out of EBIs in LMICs."

 Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a ligand sensitive nuclear receptor and
master regulator of adipogenesis. There exist FDA approved drugs that bind the ligand binding domain (LBD) of
PPARγ to induce a well characterized conformational change, which alters the activity of this transcription factor.
However, the functionally critical N-terminal intrinsically disordered AF1 domain remains poorly understood from
a structural standpoint due to the limited number of biophysical methods that can provide atomic level detail of
binding interactions and AF1 conformational states. Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1
(PIN1) is a known protein binding partner of PPARγ that exerts its catalytic activity specifically at pSer/pThr-Pro
motifs, facilitating the cis/trans isomerization of proline bonds along the peptide backbone. Preliminary data from
our lab and others suggest PIN1 binds the AF1 region of PPARγ with a much greater affinity than the LBD, an
observation which presents the opportunity to better understand the role of AF1 function in PPARγ biology. This
binding interaction suggests a cascade of post translational modifications (PTMs), including kinase-mediated
phosphorylation and PIN1 enzyme-catalyzed proline cist/trans isomerization of the AF1 region, may be
responsible for tuning the transcriptional activity of PPARγ and maintaining activation of adipogenic gene
programs. In this project I will use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to monitor PTM
(phosphorylation and isomerization) induced changes in AF1 conformational states and correlate this data with
cellular function associated with PPARγ-mediated gene programs that influence adipogenesis and insulin
sensitization. Aim 1 of this project outlines the use of NMR methods to monitor and describe the phosphorylation-
dependent and isomerization-dependent conformational changes the AF1 domain undergoes. These NMR
studies will be complemented by kinetic and structural insight gleaned from biolayer interferometry (BLI)
experiments to measure binding affinity of AF1 peptides to PIN1, X-ray crystallography studies of PIN1 in
complex with AF1 peptides, and cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) using full length PPARγ and PIN1 to
identify intermolecular protein contacts which may not be exclusive to the AF1 domain. To correlate the structural
and molecular mechanisms described by Aim 1 with functional effects observed in cells, Aim 2 of this project
uses structure-guided mutagenesis, transcriptional reporter assays, and knockdown experiments in pre-
adipocytes to understand the role of PIN1 as a mediator of PPARγ function during adipogenesis. Gene
expression analysis and assays that measure cellular endpoints associated with PPARγ function will further
assess the roles of these PTMs within the AF1 domain in promoting adipogenic function."

Neuroinflammation is a major factor in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inflammatory brain microglia
are characterized by altered cholesterol and lipid metabolism. Cholesterol and many receptors governing
inflammatory responses colocalize in the ordered membrane microdomains often designated as lipid rafts. Upon
activation, lipid raft resident and recruited molecules assemble and initiate signaling cascades leading to
inflammation. We have identified the apoA-I binding protein (AIBP, encoded by the APOA1BP gene) as a key
regulator of cellular cholesterol metabolism, which can selectively target lipid rafts in inflammatory cells
(inflammarafts) via its binding to TLR4. While extracellular AIBP regulates cholesterol depletion from the plasma
membrane and controls lipid rafts, intracellular AIBP localizes to mitochondria, facilitates mitophagy and helps
maintain normal mitochondrial function and control oxidative stress. Apoa1bp-/- APP/PS1 mice present more
amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques, an exacerbated dysfunctional microglia phenotype and show increases in cell death
when compared to APP/PS1 mice. Mitochondria in AIBP-deficient microglia are morphologically distorted, with
a characteristic hyper-branched and cupped shape, typically seen following oxidative stress. The AAV-mediated
expression of a secreted form of AIBP in the brain of Apoa1bp-/- APP/PS1 mice restored the homeostatic
microglia morphology. The goal of this proposal is to delineate mechanisms governing protective effects of AIBP
in the AD brain, focusing on microglial lipid rafts and on mitochondrial dysfunction. Specifically, in Aim 1 we
propose to test the hypothesis that extracellular AIBP reverses pathological lipid rafts in microglia to reduce
neuroinflammation and protect against neurodegeneration in a mouse model of AD. We have identified a TLR4-
binding domain in the AIBP molecule and demonstrated that an AIBP(ΔTLR4) variant, which does not bind TLR4,
cannot reverse lipid raft alterations. Using AAV delivery, we plan to restore expression of secreted variants of
AIBP in the brain of Apoa1bp-/- APP/PS1 mice and expect that AIBP(wt) but not AIBP(ΔTLR4) will lessen
neuroinflammation, the Aβ plaque burden and accumulation of phospho-tau. We also expect improvements in
memory and learning. In Aim 2, we will be testing the hypothesis that intracellular AIBP protects mitochondrial
dynamics and function in a mouse model of AD. Mitochondria are the major sites displaying concentration of
intracellular AIBP, and preliminary studies suggest AIBP involvement in control of mitochondrial function,
mitophagy and oxidative stress. Methods will include correlated light microscopy and 3D EM across scales,
leveraging advances in serial blockface scanning EM and EM tomography, along with correlated measures of
bioenergetics by Seahorse. To test relevance of the proposed mechanisms to human AD, in Aim 3 we will
characterize AIBP-related markers of lipid rafts and mitochondrial dysfunction in postmortem and biopsy brain
sections from AD subjects."

 High-grade Spinal Cord Glioma (SCG) is an orphan disease that results in significant
morbidity and mortality, with no effective treatment options available. Despite significant advances
in our knowledge of the disease process, there have unfortunately been limited changes to the
clinical outcomes. In part, this represents the malignant nature of a disease that is refractory to
the standard of care. On the other hand, this raises the question of the translational value of
existing preclinical animal models, especially from a surgical standpoint – where widely scalable
large animal models of SCG were previously unavailable. To this end, the Boulis and Canoll
laboratories partnered to begin addressing this gap in the field by developing a minipig SCG
model. Through lentiviral targeting of the well implicated RTK/RAS/PI3K and p53 pathways, our
preliminary data demonstrates the induction of high-grade astrocytoma with histopathologic,
radiologic, and transcriptomic characterization in 100% of minipigs. Consequently, we posit that
the next steps to advancement of this model system are to modulate tumor phenotype and to
demonstrate its utility in a directly translatable surgical application. In the enclosed proposal, we
will begin by evaluating the induction of SCG by targeting common genetic lesions implicated in
the human disease including PDGFB, P53, CDKN2A, EGFR, and PTEN (AIM 1). This represents
the opportunity to produce highly characterized SCG lesions for therapeutic testing in an
immunocompetent, more anatomically relevant, large animal model. In parallel, we will apply our
existing minipig SCG model (AIM 2) to perform the first intra-tumoral convection enhanced
delivery (CED) study for SCG in a large animal. Rodent studies of chemotherapeutic CED for
SCG have reported suppression of tumor growth and amelioration of neurologic deficits. However,
these data cannot be readily scaled for translation due to anatomic limitations of rodent systems.
Despite an ongoing Phase I human trial for CED in SCG, drug distribution and CED parameters
are poorly understood. Indeed, failures of CED in human trials for intracranial glioma can be
attributed to both ineffective drug distribution and single treatments. As such, our study will employ
implanted pumps for prolonged intratumoral CED. We will investigate parameters (flow rate,
volume of infusion) to evaluate optimal readouts (volume of distribution, reflux, safety, radiologic
vs chemotherapeutic distribution). These data will have immediate translational impact on present
and future trials."

Many individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) also experience significant psychological distress or
meet the criteria for common mood and anxiety disorders with potentially significant implications for SUD
outcomes and SUD treatment effects. Examining these implications is important for identifying optimal
treatments for patients with comorbid conditions. Past research on the impact of such comorbidities has
produced mixed results, mainly due to small sample sizes or reliance on observational studies. In this
proposal, a large-scale study of the impact of 1) mood and anxiety disorder as well as 2) psychological distress
comorbidity on SUD outcomes and SUD treatment effects is proposed using data from over 5,000 patients
from 20 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological and psychosocial treatments of SUDs
sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Our aims include the use of modern individual participant
meta-analytic methods to combine the individual level data and to examine whether and to what extent SUD
outcomes and SUD treatment effects vary among patients with and without comorbidity. Outcomes will include
retention in treatment to the end of the trial, continued use of drugs ascertained by urine toxicology and self-
report, and social outcomes (including occupational outcomes and criminal justice involvement). In Aim 1, data
from RCTs will be combined to examine the impact of psychiatric comorbidity (i.e., mood and anxiety disorders
as well as psychological distress, jointly and separately) on the SUD outcomes, irrespective of treatment arm,
using mixed effect regression models. The RCT samples will be balanced with regards to socio-demographic
and clinical factors that may vary across studies using propensity score methods. Aim 2 will use a similar
methodology to examine the moderating effect of comorbidity on SUD treatment effects by examining
interaction terms of SUD treatment by comorbidity in mixed regression models. In Aim 3, we will examine
whether concomitant medication treatment of mood and anxiety disorders will change the impact of these
disorders on the SUD outcomes and SUD treatment effects. In Aim 4, we will reweight the RCT samples to
resemble target samples of individuals with SUDs receiving treatment in the general population to address
exclusion (and possible under-representation) of patients with severe psychiatric conditions from SUD RCTs.
The results from reweighted samples will be compared with the results of the original unweighted samples. The
project significantly advances research on the impact of these comorbidities on SUD outcomes and SUD
treatment effects using individual participant data from an unprecedentedly large group of rigorously conducted
trials that have used a core set of standardized assessments and consistent outcome measures."

memory are still poorly understood, mainly due to a lack of knowledge of the signaling molecules of the
presynaptic cytomatrix and tools to spatially and temporally manipulate presynaptic plasticity. This gap in
knowledge is a fundamental barrier to the field. In this project, we will develop and utilize innovative proteomic,
genome editing, and optogenetic approaches to solve these problems, revealing the proteins and inner workings
of the cytomatrix of presynapses from distinct neuronal cell types and their roles in learning and memory. We
anticipate these data will provide a new and unparalleled molecular framework for future studies on presynaptic
physiology as well as insights into how forms of presynaptic plasticity modulate behavior."
10795014,"An estimated 15,000 Veterans suffer a stroke per year, more than 75% of whom have persistent hand
impairment even after a full course of rehabilitation that significantly diminishes their independence.
Fundamentally, post-stroke upper limb impairments arise from altered muscle activation patterns. Thus, direct
training of muscle activation patterns holds promise. Unfortunately, altered muscle activation patterns are not
fully addressed in current rehabilitation. Previous efforts have been limited to training a single pair of muscles,
failing to address aberrant intersegmental coupling. To address this gap, a novel EMG-controlled game system
has been developed: EMG signals are mapped to the 2-dimensional motion of a cursor on a computer screen
to play games. In a preliminary study, the target EMG patterns were derived from 4 nonparetic distal upper
limb muscle EMGs, while games were played using 4 paretic distal upper limb muscle EMGs mapped to the
target patterns, thereby promoting use of the nonparetic muscle activation patterns in the paretic limb. Twenty
stroke survivors improved upper limb function assessed by the Wolf Motor Function Test Functional Abilities
(WMFT FA) significantly after 9 game sessions. Objective: To expand the capacity of the EMG-controlled
game system and integrate it into a full therapy paradigm. Aim 1: Improve the system. Muscle activation
patterns will be characterized with nonnegative EMG amplitudes to make the game control more intuitive. The
number of EMG input channels will be increased to include both proximal and distal upper limb muscles for
intersegmental training. More games will be created for engagement. Feasibility of the improved system will be
evaluated with neurologically intact Veterans. Aims 2-3 will evaluate the system with Veteran stroke survivors.
Veterans stroke survivors will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. The treatment group will receive 9
EMG game sessions and 9 task practice therapy sessions in an alternating order. The control group will
receive 18 task practice therapy sessions. Evaluation will occur at baseline, post, and 1-month follow-up. Aim
2: Determine the effect of the EMG game system plus task practice therapy on upper limb function. Hypothesis:
The group training with the EMG games in conjunction with task practice therapy will improve their upper limb
function assessed by WMFT FA (primary) more than the group training with dose-matched task practice therapy
only. Aim 3: Determine the neuromechanical changes associated with training with the EMG-controlled games.
Hypothesis: The paretic muscle activation patterns will assimilate to the nonparetic pattern only for the treatment
group. The similarity will be quantified by computing the angle between the hyperplane defined by the paretic EMG
patterns and the plane defined by the nonparetic EMG patterns. Impact: This research will address the current
treatment gap by developing/evaluating a novel EMG-controlled game system to train muscle activation patterns,
thereby directly addressing the origin of post-stroke motor impairment. This research is expected to enhance upper
limb rehabilitation outcomes, contributing to improved independence and quality of life for Veterans with stroke."
10867528,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Neurological disorders including stroke are highly prevalent and have substantial medical, financial, and human 
costs, including behavioral/functional disruptions that negatively impact quality of life. As such, the inclusion of 
functional assessments in studies of brain disorders is a necessary component of a high-profile, translational, 
and impactful biomedical research program. In this way, the West Virginia University (WVU) Rodent Behavior 
Core (RBC), a shared instrumentation facility dedicated to the assessment of functional outcomes in rodents, is 
a vital component of the WVU Stroke Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (WVU Stroke CoBRE). WVU 
RBC staff offer comprehensive behavioral testing services from ‘design to dissemination’ that include: 
consultation on experimental design and task selection, writing assistance, behavior testing training, conducting 
behavioral tests, maintaining RBC equipment, hardware and software, and data entry and statistical analysis 
assistance. To date, the RBC offers 27 distinct stroke-relevant tests comprising 5 domains of brain function that 
have enabled the facility and staff to support the work of 64 WVU investigators and trainees. This support has 
resulted in the submission of 58 internal and external grant proposals in which behavioral assays were proposed 
(18 of which have been funded). As well, 26 journal articles that utilized RBC services have been published. For 
Phase II of the WVU Stroke CoBRE, the RBC will 1) continue to provide high quality resources and operational 
support to the WVU Stroke CoBRE Junior Investigators, 2) implement new capabilities, facilities, and operation 
procedures to a productive core to support behavioral assessments, and 3) progress the RBC towards fiscal 
independence from the WVU Stroke CoBRE. Capitalizing on the successful implementation of the WVU RBC 
during the initial period, achieving these specific aims will enhance our ability to provide all necessary equipment, 
resources, and expertise to conduct rodent behavioral assessments to support WVU Stroke CoBRE-funded 
projects as well as other WVU investigators. This will enable the RBC to become a premiere facility for the 
assessment of rodent behavior, poise WVU to emerge as a center for excellence in the evaluation of stroke and 
its comorbidities, and support translational and collaborative research to enhance our understanding of 
neurological disorders and elucidating possible therapeutic interventions for the treatment of stroke and other 
brain disease."
10604654,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Uncontrolled epilepsy is a major public health burden, affecting over 1.5 million patients in the US, resulting in
total direct costs of up to $50,000 per year for individual patients. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) have
been the focus of wearable-based seizure monitoring research for the past decade, while little work has been
done in the detection of other seizure types. Focal seizures (FS) in particular, are the most common seizure
type, affecting over 60% of people with active epilepsy. Accurate FS detection can promote safety, providing
real-time alerting to caregivers, and can support more accurate seizure tracking, bypassing the need for manual
diaries and providing important data for physicians to better manage epilepsy. Our team has developed a
software application on a popular consumer wearable device, to record data from accelerometer (ACC) and
photoplethysmography (PPG) biosensors, with the goal of providing an easy, non-stigmatizing method for FS
monitoring.
We propose a new methodology of detection that leverages the unique seizure characteristics of focal seizures
to substantially reduce the rate of false alarms, which can result in poor compliance with monitoring. Our
approach is based on the scientific premise that while focal seizures can vary significantly across individuals,
they are usually far less variable within individuals, owing to their propensity for onset and propagation in the
same symptomatogenic zones. We propose an adaptive methodology that can accurately classify FSs for
specific individuals over time. We are uniquely positioned to complete this goal, as we can leverage the
thousands of hours of data we have collected from previous trials, and our team has extensive prior experience
in training and testing seizure detection algorithms. In this proposal, we plan to develop our algorithm through
the following aims: (1) Developing a patient-independent focal seizure classification methodology leveraging
data we have obtained from previous IRB approved research. (2) Enhancing our algorithm by creating a patient-
dependent classification methodology. This aim, in particular, will allow the proposed algorithm to significantly
reduce false alarm rates (FARs). (3) Prospectively validating the proposed algorithm in an observational study.
We expect the final detector to significantly improve FAR without sacrificing sensitivity. If successful, we will
submit a Phase II proposal focused on further validation, expansion to include ambulatory patients, and
commercialization.
Our overall goal is to use our clinical and technical expertise to significantly improve the lives of people with
epilepsy. We believe that with this algorithm technology on the EpiWatch digital health platform, we can help
ease the physical, mental, and financial burdens of uncontrolled epilepsy, thus improving quality-of-life for people
with epilepsy."
10883548,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
ETV6 is a transcriptional repressor involved inhematopoietic stem cell maintenance and terminal differentiation
of megakaryocytes. ETV6 conditional knockout mice demonstrate a marked decrease in peripheral platelet
counts and a compensatory increase in immature megakaryocytes. In concordance with these findings, in
recent years, a number of germline mutations in ETV6 that result in mislocalization of the protein from the
nucleus to the cytoplasm have been associated with inherited thrombocytopenia. Carriers of these mutations
are also at an increased risk of hematologic malignancies as ~30% have gone on to develop myelodysplastic
syndrome or leukemia. Most of these germline mutations are found in the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of ETV6.
Functional studies of these DBD mutations demonstrate a loss of DNA-binding capacity in vitro and a loss of
transcriptional repression in cells. However, one mutation, the Pro214Leu missense mutation identified in 5
families thus far, occurs in the long intrinsically disordered central domain of ETV6. It too demonstrates a loss
of transcriptional repression in vitro, but the mechanism explaining this loss has not yet been established.
Preliminary data I have gathered demonstrates that this Pro214Leu missense mutation creates a de novo
nuclear export signal (NES) leading to exportin 1 (XPO1) mediated nuclear export. This constitutes the first
described instance of a point mutation creating a de novo NES. We intend to develop cellular and animal
model systems to probe the effects of this unexpected disease mechanism on thrombopoiesis. We are
developing a homologous ETV6 P214L transgenic mouse line will validate its suitability as an animal model of
ETV6-related thrombocytopenia. This will allow us to use genetic and chemical tools to study the effects of
ETV6 P214L nuclear relocalization on megakaryocyte and platelet development. Lastly, a preliminary
bioinformatics search utilizing ClinVar, a publicly available database of genetic variation, and an NES
prediction server has yielded additional candidate mutations that may also create de novo NESs. We intend to
show that missense mutation dependent nuclear export is a general mechanism of disease, and
characterization of candidate NESs may yield novel biomarkers of disease."

Patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are known to have greater balance and gait impairment and double
the rate of falls relative to healthy older adults (60-70% vs ~30%). Currently, few effective interventions
exist to manage and mitigate falls in AD, and unfortunately, falls continue to be one of the primary drivers of
morbidity, institutionalization, and mortality among AD patients. Recent studies have shown that AD patients
have a two-fold higher prevalence of vestibular impairment (~50%) relative to age-matched controls (~25%
prevalence). Additionally, in pilot data from an ongoing observational study, we have shown that vestibular
loss is associated with an increased rate of falls in AD patients. Vestibular therapy (VT) is a well-established
treatment for vestibular loss, and consists of physical therapy-based exercises designed to foster
compensation for reduced vestibular function. VT is effective in improving balance and reducing fall risk in
cognitively-intact patients with vestibular impairment. However, whether VT could be effective in improving
balance and reducing falls in AD patients with vestibular loss has never been explored. In this study, we
propose a randomized controlled trial of VT in 100 patients with mild-moderate AD who have vestibular
impairment. We will randomize patients 1:1 to a standard course of VT (1 session per week for 8 weeks) or
to an active control matched for effort and duration. We will compare the efficacy of VT vs. active control
primarily on 1-year incident fall rate. We will also investigate potential intermediate outcomes between VT
and falls – specifically balance outcomes (a predicted target of VT) and spatial cognitive outcomes (a novel
target of VT) – to understand potential mechanisms by which VT may influence fall rates. We hypothesize
that VT will have preliminary efficacy in reducing 1-year incident fall rates relative to an active control
intervention in a convenience sample of 100 patients with mild-moderate AD. We will also explore whether
VT has preliminary efficacy in improving balance and cognition relative to the active control intervention.
To accomplish the proposed study, we will recruit 100 patients from the Memory and Alzheimer’s
Treatment Center, a well-established AD clinical research resource at Johns Hopkins. Falls are a
disastrous outcome in patients with AD. If this pilot trial followed by a Phase III multi-center trial provide
strong evidence for the benefit of VT in reducing falls, this low-risk intervention could be widely
disseminated and implemented by an existing workforce and infrastructure, and produce substantial,
sustained change in AD clinical practice."
10820541,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Biliary atresia (BA) results in severe disruption of bile acid homeostasis and is the predominant disease causing
neonatal obstructive cholestasis. Bile acid homeostasis in regulated by the nuclear hormone receptor Farnesoid
X Receptor (FXR) by activation of the intestinal and hepatic hormone, fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19).
FGF19 suppresses bile acid synthesis of hepatic cytochrome P450 7a1 (Cyp7a1), the key enzyme for classical
bile acid synthesis. In healthy infants, the FGF19 expression is mainly in the intestine and low in the liver. In
contrast, hepatic FGF19 is elevated in BA infants to compensate for loss of intestinal bile acid-induced FGF19
secretion. The increase in hepatic FGF19 and bile acid accumulation in BA infants suggests an uncoupling of
FGF19 signaling that normally suppresses hepatic Cyp7a1 and bile acid synthesis. A secondary source of bile
acid synthesis in hepatocytes and cholangiocytes is the alternative pathway via Cyp27a1. There is a gap in our
knowledge of how the regulation of Cyp7a1 and Cyp27a1 via FXR-FGF19 signaling contributes to bile acid
homeostasis during neonatal obstructive cholestasis. This proposal aims to understand the adaptive, time-
dependent mechanism by which the liver compensates for altered intestinal bile acid signaling and how this
compensation effects bile acid synthesis via the classical and alternative pathways. Our central hypothesis is
that hepatic adaptation to obstructive cholestasis leads to increased hepatocyte FXR-FGF19 signaling, but with
impaired suppression of Cyp7a1 or compensation by Cyp27a1 to sustain bile acid accumulation. In Aim 1a we
will characterize the ontogeny of cholestatic liver injury, bile acid homeostasis, and cell-specific hepatocyte and
cholangiocyte gene expression signatures in a newly developed neonatal pig model of bile duct ligation (BDL).
In Aim 1b, we will quantify the molecular mechanisms of FXR and FGF19 signaling pathways involved in bile
acid synthesis during long-term bile acid exposure using human cultured hepatocyte and cholangiocyte
organoids. In Aim 2a, we will test whether FGF19 infusion dose-dependently suppresses Cyp7a1 expression at
early and late time points after BDL. In Aim 2b, we will test if early activation of FXR-FGF19 signaling protects
against BDL induced cholestasis. This study will provide understanding of the mechanism that regulate bile acid
homeostasis in the context of neonatal obstructive cholestasis and test potential therapeutic interventions.
Career development and environment: To enhance my potential for future success as an independent
researcher I will receive mentorship from Dr. Douglas Burrin, PhD and training in use of stable isotope kinetics
modeling, mass spectrometry analysis, RNA-seq pipeline analysis and visualization, and hepatic organoid
culturing. This training will be conducted in an outstanding research environment of the Children’s Nutrition
Research Center (CNRC) with support of NIDDK Digestive Disease Center technical cores and an expert faculty
oversight committee at Baylor College of Medicine. This project will give me the scientific expertise and research
skills to launch an independent research career in the field of pediatric liver diseases."
10894607,"Project Summary / Abstract
Vascularization has long been a hurdle in the development of tissue engineering, either for therapeutic implants
or biomimetic models. A number of cell, signal, scaffold, and culture techniques and methods have been
investigated for the creation of vascular structures and ultimately networks. In this context, endothelial cells are
a critical cell type, as they comprised the intimal layer of vessels. Is has also been reported that macrophages,
in co-culture with endothelial cells, can provide pro-vascularization effects as signalers and chaperones. Another
strategy for the creation of vascular structures of endothelial cells has been culture in simulated microgravity,
where endothelial cells self-organize into tubules and spheroids, which is not seen under equivalent normal
gravity conditions. Lastly, in the evaluation of endothelial cell responses, vascularization, and even vascular
pathology, sex-differences have been demonstrated, though sex as a biological variable is often not reported or
considered historically in the existing literature. As such, this project aims to (1) investigate the hormonal and
genomic sex-dependent effects of simulated microgravity on endothelial cells regarding key factors of
vascularization, and (2) investigate endothelial cell – macrophage co-culture in simulated microgravity for effects
on keys factors of vascularization, while also considering sex as a biological variable. The experimental design
of this study will evaluate critical aspects of genetic expression and the tubule and spheroid structures formed
from the proposed culture methodology. The data will be evaluated in the context of sex-differences in these
vascular cells. The significance of this work is the development of the unique culture environment represented
by simulated microgravity that has shown promising results in the creation of vascular structures. Further
significance is the insight into sex-differences of vascular cells in the context of tissue engineering and
vascularization. Specifically, the development of novel strategies for producing vascular constructs could
improve existing methods for the creation of implants and biomimetic models, as well as our understanding of
sex-differences for the purposes of more personalized translational and clinical assessment and care."
10812332,"Research benefitting the health of children requires training a new generation of pediatrician physician-
scientists prepared for independent careers in basic biomedical research. The collaborative research
enterprise of Emory University and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta is committed to meeting this need. The
Atlanta Pediatric Scholars Program (APSP) has provided crucial support to 18 scholars to date (15 previous
and 3 current), enabling them to bridge the treacherous gap between completing fellowship and obtaining
independent funding. The APSP Scholars have been tremendously successful during and after the two grant
cycles; the scholars have acquired a total of 77 awards as PI since the beginning of the program in 2012,
including 9 NIH K grants, 16 other NIH grants, 25 University/Pilot awards, and 27 Foundation awards. For this
renewal application, we have expanded the training faculty to 41 basic science investigators, each with an
active laboratory research program, with total extramural grant support of $51.3, $39.4M of that coming from
NIH. We have also added more focused career development curriculum and bolstered the URM recruitment
and retention plan. Reflecting the program's multidisciplinary approach,11 prospective mentors are outside the
Department of Pediatrics, including the Department of Biomedical Engineering, a joint department between
Emory and the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). Robust fellowship programs in the Department
of Pediatrics and continued recruitment of junior faculty provide a large pool of outstanding Scholar candidates.
The formal training curriculum is grounded in intensive laboratory research in areas of basic and translational
science relevant to child health, mentored by experienced investigators, and supplemented by didactic
coursework, career development training, and participation in scientific exchange. The academic strengths and
resources of the Emory research enterprise bolster a critical mass of investigators working in a variety of child
health-related disciplines to create an ideal environment for basic researcher career development. The
mentorship and structured supervision of the program propels APSP Scholars to organize their research
around specific goals and to work towards publication and submission of extramural award applications. The
research infrastructure to support this program is therefore in place, and robust partnerships among Emory,
Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, and Georgia Tech continue to support recruitment and expansion of the
research enterprise. Training Underrepresented minority physician-scientists is a particular focus of this
program and will be facilitated by existing strengths and partnerships in Atlanta and a robust URM recruitment
and retention program. The program utilizes both formative and summative assessment, including a rigorous
system for tracking and assessing progress, which we use to enhance the program. The APSP is a vital
component of a growing academic child health enterprise and is poised to provide outstanding career
development for the next generation of leaders in child health research."

three science themes: Health Impacts of Waterborne Contaminants (WATER); Health Impacts of Indoor and
Outdoor Airborne Contaminants (AIR); and Emerging Environmental Health Threats (EMERGING THREATS).
To optimize efficiency, ACCESS uses the following two existing laboratory facilities to leverage resources
available to these facilities and extend the capabilities ACCESS: the Environmental Chemistry and Toxicology
Laboratory (College of Agriculture Food and Environment) and the Small Molecule Mass Spectrometry Facility
(College of Medicine), to measure organic chemical environmental pollutants, trace-elements, their
metabolites, and related molecules of interest to UK-CARES investigators. Effective use of these facilities by
UK-CARES investigators will require both routine analysis and new method development and validation.
Specifically, Aim 1 of ACCESS is to provide measurements of panels of environmental chemicals. We will
provide technically robust methods for detection and quantification of a range of halogenated organics:
polychlorinated biphenyls, dioxins, trihalomethanes and haloacetonitriles, per- and poly- fluorinated alkyl
substances, non-halogenated organics including flame-retardants, environmental phenols, and trace-elements,
to support EHS research across the translational spectrum. Aim 2 is to develop or adapt novel methods to
support ongoing needs of UK-CARES investigators. Methods will be developed de novo or adapted from the
literature. We will use our Thermo TSQ Altis Plus triple stage quadrupole mass spectrometer to develop and
validate survey methods that can profile environmental chemicals in multiple classes using a single analytical
workflow and use high-resolution MS methods employing our Thermo Exploris 240 orbitrap mass spectrometer
for untargeted profiling of environmental chemicals in relevant matrices. Techniques for spatial analysis,
microanalysis, and speciation analysis of trace-elements are refined for environmental health studies using our
Agilent 7900 ICP-MS and associated peripherals. Aim 3 is to work with administrative and data management
functions of the Center to enable robust fiscal oversight, project management, sample tracking and data
reporting. We will work in tandem with the Integrated Health Sciences Facility Core and the Administrative
Core to ensure that Center members receive priority access, that the activities of ACCESS are aligned with the
UK-CARES strategic vision of the three science themes, and that services and outcomes are tracked through
the online IHSFC Research Support Portal. ACCESS will provide reliable, technically robust methods and

community-academic partnerships that 1) support meaningful community engagement; 2) build environmental
health literacy; 3) reduce environmental health risks; and 4) decrease health disparities in rural Appalachia.
Decades of legacy mining and fracking operations, as well as an aging water infrastructure, have resulted in
exposure to water and air contaminants which have led to community concerns about water and air quality as
well as emerging environmental health threats. The CEC will build on a strong foundation of successful
community engagement and support environmental health science (EHS) by connecting investigators with
community partners to promote projects consistent with the three science themes of the Center—(a) Health
Impacts of Waterborne Contaminants; (b) Health Impacts of Indoor & Outdoor Airborne Contaminants; and (c)
Emerging Environmental Health Threats. The CEC will use an iterative multidirectional process that brings
local knowledge into the Center, leverages UK-CARES’ investigator strengths and institutional support, reports
back research findings with at-risk communities, and encourages solution-focused communication among
community and organizational stakeholders. Specifically, the aims of the CEC are to: 1) foster and cultivate
multidirectional community-academic partnerships engaged in UK-CARES research that is responsive to
regional environmental health issues, needs and concerns; 2) translate and disseminate EHS findings through
science communication and advocacy training to foster clinical decision making and policy formation; and 3)
strengthen partnerships with community and healthcare stakeholders in UK-CARES’ environmental health
research across the translational spectrum. First, we will engage our Stakeholder Advisory Board members to
offer culturally appropriate insight that will inform and assist Center investigators in their research. The CEC
will use formal (e.g., focus groups) and informal (e.g., listening sessions) means to engage in multi-directional
dialogue with community stakeholders to assess environmental health concerns. In turn, the CEC will serve as
a bridge to and from the community to facilitate community engagement in EHS that leverages the strengths of
UK-CARES and is responsive to community concerns. Second, will provide training in effective science
communication and advocacy with healthcare providers, faculty, and community stakeholders. We will build on
our impactful science communication training curriculum to prepare scientists for effective multi-modal
dissemination of findings, including use of evidence-based advocacy skills with policymakers. Lastly, we will
collaborate with the Integrated Health Sciences Facility Core to create tailored multi-modal report back
approaches to reach healthcare providers to promote clinical decision making related to how the environment

partnerships across the translational spectrum. This goal will be accomplished by providing pilot funds along
with guidance and support for innovative, time-sensitive preliminary studies and community projects that
improve our understanding of environmental exposures, human biology, and disease. Specifically, the aims of
the PPP are to 1) support new opportunities for innovative, collaborative environmental health research; 2)
enhance interactions and expand the critical mass of investigators with expertise and experience in multi-
disciplinary, translational environmental health research at UK and in Appalachian communities; 3) provide
guidance and support to ensure the success of UK-CARES Pilot Projects; and 4) evaluate utilization,
efficiency, quality, and impact of the PPP. Strong institutional support of the PPP from UK is a hallmark of our
proposal. In fact, UK entities will provide matching funds, representing 37% of the total funds allocated for pilot
projects. The PPP will provide three general categories of pilot research funding opportunities consistent with
the science themes and strategic vision of UK-CARES. First, Pilot grants will generate new preliminary data
and support (a) established Center members to catalyze new research opportunities consistent with Center
science themes; (b) non-member scientists to expand collaborations and bring new dimensions to the Center;
and (c) creative, early-stage investigators to establish competitive research programs. Second, Community
grants will provide direct support to community organizations with a UK faculty collaborator to address a priority
science theme. Third, Mini grants will foster rapid, time-sensitive development of, or access to, new and novel
technologies as well as community-engaged research. The PPP will communicate, collaborate, coordinate,
and create synergy across Center cores and programs to ensure that pilot-funded investigators receive the
assistance they need to develop and carry out their pilot projects. The PPP will engage investigators and
community stakeholders, both within UK-CARES and outside the Center, as reviewers and grantees to
address questions related to environmental pathways (e.g., water, air) to exposures, human biology, and new
contaminants and emerging threats. The overall progress of the PPP, and how effectively it has promoted
environmental health research, will be monitored through the existing tracking and evaluation component of
UK’s Center for Clinical and Translational Science, in coordination with the Administrative Core. Incorporating
pilot-funded faculty into the Center will have a major impact on expanding the ability of our Center to examine
important questions related to emerging environmental health issues and novel technologies, and to bolster the

 In 2016, high levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were discovered in the Cape Fear
River in eastern North Carolina (NC), part of NC's largest watershed and drinking water supply for over 1 million
people. More recently, PFAS were detected in central NC, in the Haw River, which supplies drinking water for
Pittsboro, NC, and in Jordan Lake, a recreational reservoir that also provides drinking water for several cities in
the Research Triangle area. Although PFAS contamination has been detected in 49 states, biomedical
researchers in NC are leading the way nationally in assessing the extent of PFAS contamination in waterways
and air and in conducting studies on the effects of PFAS on human and ecosystem health. These chemicals
have been used since the 1950s in a wide range of consumer products and have been found in the blood of
people and animals worldwide. Research suggests that PFAS are harmful to human and animal health, with
documented immune system impacts that may influence individual susceptibility to COVID-19. Using cutting-
edge, interdisciplinary research on PFAS as a foundation, the Center for Public Engagement with Science in
the UNC Institute for the Environment, proposes Iterative Design to Engage All (IDEA) Learners, with a goal
of building the capacity of NC teachers, especially those in economically disadvantaged communities and those
impacted by PFAS contamination, to introduce current biomedical science and career opportunities to diverse
students. We will accomplish this goal through three specific aims: (1) Apply design thinking and design-based
research approaches to co-develop, implement, and revise standards-aligned curriculum units that feature
current research on the health effects of PFAS; (2) Increase teacher knowledge of current PFAS research and
self-efficacy for incorporating current biomedical science into classroom instruction; and (3) Support participating
teachers in promoting biomedical research careers to diverse students. Over five years, IDEA Learners will
result in two curriculum units with up to eight PFAS-focused lessons that have been designed for NGSS and
incorporate research-generated data and science and engineering practices relevant to biomedical research
careers. These units will include videos that highlight diverse environmental health sciences researchers.
Through long-duration professional development (PD), 48 teachers will deepen their content knowledge and
improve their self-efficacy, positioning them to increase URM and female students' interest in current biomedical
science instruction. An additional 48 teachers will participate in short-duration PD, and all teachers will have the
potential to reach over 30,000 students during the project period. The project will lead to enhanced capacity to
offer inclusive learning environments and improved support for URM, female, and LEP students, ultimately
cultivating a more diverse future biomedical research workforce."

Repeated concussions (mild Traumatic Brain Injury, mTBI), which are particularly prevalent in athletes and
military personnel, can lead to long-term brain health issues including dementia, depression, and other
psychiatric conditions. Recent studies suggest that mTBIs may give rise to increased risk for Alzheimer's disease
(AD) or other AD-related dementias (ADRDs), but there are few conclusive studies, and no reliable blood
biomarkers available as a predictive diagnostic tool. We are studying a unique cohort of NCAA Division I athletes
in high impact sports to develop a reliable blood biomarker assessment and examine biological mechanisms for
AD/ADRD risk after multiple mTBIs. To our knowledge, studies have not been conducted using neuron- or
astrocyte-derived exosomes (NDEs vs. ADEs) to detect Tau and amyloid pathology and seeding capacity from
those with sports-related brain injuries. The revised application now contains more specifics regarding the
existing cohort and the experiments proposed. The overall hypothesis of this project is that exosome
alterations after repeated mTBIs reflect and contribute to long-term risk for AD/ADRD. In Aim 1, we will
test the hypothesis that NDE and ADE biomarkers correlate with cognitive dysfunction following one or repeated
mTBIs in humans. Experiments in this Aim will validate exosomal biomarkers and distinguish between cargos
obtained from NDEs vs. ADEs. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that age-dependent and genetics-driven
cognitive decline and brain pathology are accelerated following either repeated mTBIs or injection of TBI-derived
exosomes in mice. The relationship between a transgene leading to amyloid and Tau aggregation and added
trauma via repeated mTBIs will be examined. In Aim 3, we hypothesize that NDEs vs. ADEs from athletes with
multiple mTBIs can elicit differential responses in primary cortical neuronal cultures. We propose that NDEs
and/or ADEs from athletes with repeated mTBIs can propagate AD pathology to primary neuronal cultures.
Our interdisciplinary team has the unique potential to reveal molecular mechanisms involved in AD pathology
after mTBIs, using a unique cohort consisting of male and female Division I athletes including baseline and post-
concussion measurements. In the revised submission, we are proposing to use primary cultures from 3xTg-AD
or wildtype mouse pups, to connect the in vivo studies in Aim 2 with the in vitro studies in Aim 3. The major
goal of this research program is to develop sensitive biomarkers post-concussion that could predict future risk
for AD/ADRD and to reveal mechanisms for exosome propagation of brain pathology post-mTBI. The unique
value of this program is the interdisciplinary team, including both mouse models and human studies, the large
cohort of Division I athletes, and the long-term biomarker studies proposed. Based on the biological
mechanisms examined herein, and the wealth of preliminary data, we will be able to design better preventative
treatment options long-term for those with one or several mTBIs who are at risk of developing dementia."

T-cell-dependent (TD) immunoglobulin A (IgA) responses regulate the composition of the gut microbiota. How
B-cell-intrinsic MHCII signaling, which is central to the development of TD IgA responses, influences host-
microbiota interactions is unknown. MHCII is widely assumed to promote clonal diversity in effector lymphocyte
populations, but this has not been tested. Here, we present evidence in support of the argument that B cell-
intrinsic MHCII signaling controls GC dynamics, IgA repertoire diversity, and microbiota composition.
Additionally, evidence from our experiments also indicate that both B-cell-intrinsic ablation of MHCII and specific
MHC genotypes are associated with enhanced bacterial dissemination from the gut. Based on these
observations and previous work by Dr. Kubinak, this R01 seeks to address the hypothesis that B-cell-intrinsic
MHCII signaling is a diversifying force of selection promoting clonal diversity in IgA plasma cell pools
and individuality in microbiota composition. The objective of Specific Aim #1 is to define the B-cell-intrinsic
role of MHCII during GC reactions in the gut; specifically focusing on its role in shaping plasma cell repertoire
diversity. A 'Confetti' mouse model will be used to visually demonstrate the effect of MHCII ablation on GC B cell
clonal diversity in the gut. IgH sequencing will be used to determine the effect of MHCII polymorphisms and MHC
heterozygosity on IgA repertoire diversity in the gut. scRNA sequencing will be used to determine how MHCII
influences overlap in clonal diversity between mucosal and systemic plasma cell pools. RAG1-/- bone marrow
(BM) chimeras will be used to quantify the effect of MHCII on cross-seeding of gut-derived plasma cells into the
BM. Reciprocal BM chimeras will be used to determine the necessity/sufficiency of defects in B-cell-intrinsic
MHCII in regulating bacterial dissemination from the gut. The objective of Specific Aim #2 is to test that microbiota
composition is an MHCII-dependent phenotype. RAG1-/- and RAG1-/-IL7R-/- BM chimeras will be used to
determine the role gut peyer's patches play in driving MHCII-mediated IgA selection in the gut. Microbial
colonization experiments in germfree GF RAG1-/- BM chimeras will determine the effect of B-cell-intrinsic MHCII
on IgA-targeting of commensal bacteria. A RAG1-/- adoptive transfer model will be used to determine if MHCII
surface density influences IgA-mediated targeting of commensals and microbiota composition. Finally, a novel
germfree MHC congenic model will be used to explicitly define the role IgA plays in driving individuality in
microbiota composition. Results from these studies will address the B-cell-intrinsic role of MHCII in regulating
mucosal IgA responses, microbiota composition, and host health. This is a critical gap in our knowledge that is
highly relevant to human health. IgA deficiency is the most common form of antibody-deficiency in humans, is
strongly linked to genetic variation in MHCII genes, and has been shown to result in dysbiosis that is associated
with chronic inflammation. Experiments outlined here are the first to address how MHC genotype influences
microbiota composition and bacterial leakage from the gut, a potent driver of chronic immune activation."
10814807,"Project Summary/Abstract
Child maltreatment is widely recognized as a serious threat to children's well-being and health. In maltreatment
cases, the fidelity and credibility of the child witness/victim's report is often critical to securing an outcome in
the best interest of the child. Eliciting information from children about the time-course and sequence of alleged
maltreatment is central in these cases. The field of child interviewing is actively debating how best to question
children about sequence in these cases with little existing empirical research on which to draw. There is a
pressing need to identify strategies for obtaining information from even young, cognitively vulnerable children
about the time course and sequence of alleged events. The proposed research will determine (1) how children
are questioned about event sequence, and how they respond, across age, in maltreatment investigations (2)
how differences in children's age, comprehension, working memory (WM), attention, and episodic memory
may impact their abilities to accurately recall event sequence, and (3) how questions and child responses
about sequence impact the likelihood that jury-eligible adults' will understand and believe children's allegations
of abuse. These aims will be achieved via four proposed projects. In Project 1, the research team will code a
sample of 581 legal transcripts to assess the sequencing content included in the prompts used to question
child witnesses about their alleged maltreatment experiences and confusion in children's responses to the
questions. Of particular interest is identifying instances of potential ambiguity for young children. In Projects 2
and 3, the research team will conduct laboratory studies with 644 4- to 12-year-olds to test the roles of
cognition and context in children's responses to sequencing questions like those identified in the maltreatment
case transcripts. Memory and response biases are predicted to be most pronounced with decreasing age and
WM, and when attention is divided. In Project 3, the research team will examine children's responses to
sequencing questions with potentially ambiguous interpretations. Their interpretations of the questions' intent
are expected to vary with age and WM in predictable ways. Finally, in Project 4 the research team will examine
mock juror interpretations of sequencing questions and children's responses. Participants from across the U.S.
(N = 300) will rate the credibility of adult questioners and child respondents selected from Projects 1-3 and the
accuracy with which mock jurors understand various sequencing questions and responses from our laboratory
studies will be determined. The proposed work is innovative in that it represents a multi-dimensional approach
to examining the cognitive, developmental, and contextual appropriateness of varying sequencing questions
asked of children in maltreatment investigations and determining the extent to which these questions may
impact just decisions in maltreatment cases. This topic has been surprisingly understudied given the
substantial implications for understanding the foundations of children's sequential knowledge and memory, and
for improving health-relevant legal outcomes in cases of child maltreatment."

We are requesting continuation of the NICHD training grant in Demography to the University of Pennsylvania
(Penn). The proposed program continues Penn’s longstanding excellence in training in Demography, as per
placement of, and scientific contributions by, trainees. It will be enhanced during the upcoming cycle by (a)
new engagement of population researchers from the Health Policy Division of the Department of Medical
Ethics & Health Policy at the Perelman School of Medicine; (b) a major reorganization of the training sequence
in demographic methods; (c) new integrated training in the areas of biomarkers, complex data structures, data
science, and quantitative methods; (d) new exchange training programs with two prominent European
research centers (Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research and French Institute for Demographic
Research); (e) expanded activities to enhance diversity. Six predoctoral positions (no postdoctoral positions)
are requested. The principal aim of the Demography predoctoral program at Penn is to train independent
researchers who are prepared to play leading roles in population analysis. This goal is achieved through
(i) intensive instruction in the methods, theoretical approaches, and empirical substance of demography and
allied disciplines; (ii) progressive incorporation of students into faculty research activities; and (iii) subsequent
branching into independent research. The training in Demography described in this proposal reflects a vision
of the population sciences and population health in which a strong background in the logic of demographic
process is the gateway to the application of contributions from elsewhere in the social and behavioral sciences
to an array of topics of public and scientific interest."

This proposal requests support for Years 15-20 of the T32 Training Program in Microbial Pathogenesis, a
highly successful program that incorporates researchers from 11 departments at the University of Utah. This
program was initially an outgrowth of the twice-monthly Microbial Pathogenesis Seminar Series (MPSS), which
brought together basic scientists and clinician scientists in Microbiology and Immunology for regular, highly
engaging research presentations. Since its inception 14 years ago, the Training Program has sponsored 3
predoctoral and 3 postdoctoral trainees annually. Predoctoral trainees enter graduate school primarily through
the Molecular Biology umbrella program, where they are supported for one year while taking rigorous core
courses and selecting a thesis laboratory. Predoctoral trainees are selected after entering a laboratory
associated with a T32 mentor, while postdoctoral trainees may be recruited from within or outside of the
University to work in T32 mentor labs. The Training Program provides many opportunities for exposure of the
trainees and the broader community to cutting edge research. Program-sponsored activities include the MPSS,
the Microbial Pathogenesis Retreat, the Summer Journal Club, the Clinical-Microbiology Combined
Conference, and advanced courses in Bacterial Pathogenesis, Molecular Virology, and Immunology. Critical to
the training environment are trainee opportunities for interaction with MPSS speakers who have a variety of
research and health perspectives, and the opportunity to host distinguished speakers. Each of the trainees
also present their research at the Training Grant Annual Retreat, providing them with an opportunity for
exposure to the greater microbial pathogenesis community on campus and to receive feedback from the
external scientists. Trainees also present important new discoveries in the Summer Journal Club. Initiated in
2013, the Clinical-Microbiology Combined Conference with the Infectious Disease Fellows in Medicine
highlights the clinical manifestation of infectious diseases with mechanistic understanding of microbial
virulence factors. Throughout the Training Grant’s history, the trainees have established a record of high
impact publications and most are pursuing careers in areas of biomedical research and teaching. The various
components of the Training Program clearly serve as the nexus of Microbial Pathogenesis on this campus.
This Microbial Pathogenesis community at the University of Utah has grown substantially in recent years,
further enhancing the environment of the supported T32 trainees."

For the millions of epilepsy patients with drug-resistant seizures, surgical resection of epileptogenic brain tissue
is often the only remaining therapeutic option. Especially in young patients who do not obtain seizure control or
suffer from unacceptable side effects from medications, there are further concerns about the effect of seizures
on development: even brief but repetitive seizures cause cognitive regression and detrimental psychosocial
effects. This motivates a particular urgency to investigate a more structured, quantitative, and non-invasive tool,
which is capable of informing families and providers to decide timely surgery by accurately providing the
probabilities of both favorable and unfavorable postoperative outcomes using data from preoperative imaging
analysis at the whole-brain level. The overall goal of this project is to develop a novel tool of benefit-risk analysis
for the presurgical evaluation of pediatric drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Toward this goal, we will validate a state-
of-the-art deep learning-based diffusion MRI technique to provide the resection margin (i.e., the distance
between epileptogenic area and eloquent area) resulting in maximized benefits (i.e., seizure freedom and long-
term neurocognitive improvement) and minimized risk (i.e., deficits in eloquent functions including
motor/language/hearing/vision). With NIH support, we have established diffusion-weighted imaging maximum a
posteriori probability (DWI-MAP) analysis with Kalman filter, which can provide individual patients with the
optimal resection margin, yielding successful avoidance of motor/language/visual deficits in 93%/91%/90% of
patients with ≥75% of patients benefiting from seizure freedom. Recently, we have also found that deep
convolutional neural network (DCNN) can provide an excellent accuracy (94-100%) to classify true positive tracts
of eloquent brain areas, suggesting that DCNN-based tract classification may outperform the DWI-MAP in
detecting diverse function-specific white matter pathways. Aim 1 of this project will investigate if a combination
of DCNN-based tract classification with Kalman filter even better predicts the resection margin, resulting in
seizure freedom and avoidance of functional deficits at a large cohort. Aim 2 will investigate if an advanced DWI
approach integrating DCNN and DWI connectome helps decide timely surgery by providing 1) preoperative
imaging markers underlying high likelihood of postoperative neurocognitive improvements and 2) mechanistic
insight in structural brain reorganization associated with postoperative verbal IQ improvement. The results of this
project are expected to ultimately improve clinical management of pediatric epilepsy by translating deep learning-
based diffusion MRI technique to optimize the surgical margin, predict the postoperative neurocognitive outcome,
and determine specific mechanism of postoperative brain reorganization, which will be validated for optimizing
clinical benefit-risk analysis before surgical intervention."
10851795,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over 50% of US adults over the age of 45 have missing teeth. Following tooth loss, the alveolar portion of the
jaw will atrophy in a process known as residual ridge resorption. While dental implant-supported crowns have
become the standard of care, market research indicates that 70% of patients must undergo a ridge augmentation
procedure to provide adequate bony structure to accept implant placement. The market for bone grafts is highly
fragmented, indicating that the ideal material meeting user needs does not exist. Most dentists remain
dissatisfied with existing bone grafts due to their challenging handling properties and poor predictability. Due to
the lack of structural integrity, they typically require extra costs and steps to place ancillary containment devices
to prevent graft migration and fibrous tissue ingrowth that impedes bone regeneration. As a result, a secondary
augmentation procedure is required in 30% of cases to ensure sufficient volume for implant placement.
RevBio, Inc. has developed a highly porous, regenerative bone graft biomaterial with adhesive properties called
Tetranite® Adhesive Dental Bone Scaffold (TN-ADBS). Unlike currently available graft materials, TN-ADBS is
cohesive during application and its unique adhesive properties allow it to maintain form, eliminating the need for
ancillary fixation or containment devices. TN-ADBS is comprised of O-Phospho-L-Serine (OPLS), which in part
makes it uniquely adhesive to bone and studies have also found OPLS during its resorption and local release to
be osteopromotive, lending this product to yield a more predictable and efficacious product.
Prior funding from the NIH-Michigan Pittsburgh Wyss Regenerative Medicine Resource Center has been used
to: (a) develop TN-ADBS, (b) evaluate its performance in user handling trials, (c) develop a canine model with a
mandibular critical-sized defect, and (d) conduct preliminary efficacy studies in this model. Based on FDA
feedback, TN-ADBS will be regulated as a device-led combination product, where OPLS is the drug constituent
promoting bone regeneration. The following proposed Phase II grant application is designed per recent FDA
feedback to address the following two Specific Aims: (1) to assess the local/systemic effects of TN-ADBS (OPLS)
and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) under maximal use conditions in a New Zealand white rabbit
model and (2) to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of TN-ADBS in a pivotal animal study for the intended
clinical use to augment deficient jaw bone by (i) showing local or systemic adverse effects of TN-ADBS treated
defects are non-inferior to controls and (ii) by showing superior ridge height maintenance throughout the course
of bone substitution in comparison to controls (p<0.05).
The results from these translational animal studies, complementary to surgeon-validated simulated use trials
and biological safety evaluation studies, will be used as the basis for filing an Investigational Device Exemption
(IDE) with the FDA to initiate human studies. Long-term, RevBio’s mission is to provide surgeons with a novel
bone grafting product to simplify surgery and improve clinical outcomes for dental ridge augmentation."

 The myelin sheath is a complex multilamellar structure wrapped around axons, enhancing the speed
and efficiency of neuronal processing in the brain. Damage to the myelin sheath, a common insult seen in
aging and different diseases, generates cellular debris. Many reports have demonstrated that removal of debris
by microglia, the primary phagocyte of the brain, is crucial in facilitating tissue repair. Moreover, failure to
remove debris in a rapid and efficient manner has been shown to further disease progression. Thus, it is
necessary to investigate the dynamics and the consequences of failed myelin debris clearance in the brain.
However, a fundamental gap exists in understanding the microglia dynamics and mechanism mediating myelin
debris clearance as current tools do not provide the cellular specificity and spatiotemporal resolution needed.
The development of longitudinal high resolution optical imaging and a new targeted inducible model of
demyelination has provided the means necessary to capture microglia’s response to myelin debris. These
experiments will provide information about the precise cellular dynamics involved in myelin debris clearance in
the live brain for the first time. The overarching goal of this proposal is to characterize the precise microglia
dynamics involved in myelin debris clearance. The overall hypothesis of this proposal is that myelin debris
will trigger the phagocytic response of microglia to begin the clearance process and failure to do so will inhibit
subsequent myelin repair. We will achieve this goal and address this hypothesis through the following Specific
Aims. Aim 1 will determine the general dynamics of debris clearance by microglia and the remyelination
process by monitoring microglia engagement and the generation of new myelin sheaths. Aim 2 will determine
the dynamics of defective debris clearance and its contribution to failed remyelination. Aim 3 will determine the
effects of aging on microglia’s ability to clear myelin debris and the remyelination process. Using high
resolution in vivo imaging, a novel method of demyelination, and genetic and pharmacological manipulations,
these experiments will describe the precise microglia dynamics involved in debris clearance and remyelination.
This proposed work has broad implications as defective debris removal is a common etiology for failed myelin
repair seen in neurodegenerative diseases and late stages of aging.
 Working closely with my sponsor and co-sponsor we have developed a rigorous training plan consisting
of both technical (in vivo imaging and chronic surgical preparations) and professional (scientific
communication, research design, mentorship, and community outreach) training. Dartmouth and Dartmouth
Hitchcock Medical Center provide a rich intellectual environment by hosting world class faculty, providing
additional resources and training opportunities that are essential for a successful career as an independent
researcher in neuroscience."

Globally, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) outrank infectious diseases in terms of public health burden.
Cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) such as heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death worldwide.
In this application we will explore the genomic risk for common CMD, including hypertension, stroke, diabetes,
obesity, dyslipidemia and kidney disease, and related traits (including BMI, blood pressure, lipid, glucose, insulin
and creatine) across populations with African ancestry (AA). There is evidence to suggest that polygenic risk
scores (PRSs) translate poorly from a discovery study in one ancestral population (e.g. European Americans) to
a target population (e.g. sub-Saharan Africans), especially when they are separated by large genetic differences.
However, this has not been evaluated with large, well-powered AA datasets. Furthermore, the high genetic
diversity and population structure among non-European Ancestry (EA) populations need to be investigated to
understand the performance of PRSs in other regions populated by people with diverse genomic backgrounds.
We bring together the Human Heredity and Health in Africa Consortium (H3Africa), other African, Jamaican and
African American core cohorts, to develop a joint resource of over 50,000 participants with relevant phenotype
and genomics data, referred to as the CARdiometabolic Disorders IN African-ancestry PopuLations
(CARDINAL) Study Site. In addition, the CARDINAL Study Site will include 5 replication cohorts with >100,000
participants from diverse ancestry populations. Our main objective is to establish a Study Site for PRS
Methods and Analysis for AA Populations and to collaboratively generate and refine PRS for other
populations of diverse ancestry by integrating existing datasets with genomics and phenotype data for
a range of complex diseases and traits. Our first aim is to integrate phenotype and genomic datasets from
~50,000 African individuals from seven individual cohort studies. Subsequently, we will evaluate PRSs and
develop a novel method that takes into consideration, ancestry-specific genomic regions to improve prediction
of PRSs in populations characterised by genetic sub-structure. Finally, we will develop an interactive dashboard
for dissemination of PRS-related data from diverse ancestry populations. CARDINAL Study Site is ideal for
generating novel biologic insights into complex disease etiology, with applications in global populations.
Members of the CARDINAL team have successfully worked together for about a decade, generating and
disseminating scientific knowledge through high impact publications. By establishing a Study Site in the
Polygenic Risk Score Diversity Consortium, CARDINAL brings the largest cohort of African-ancestry
participants to the table, to explore the genomics contribution to common CMDs and other NCDs."

for the Future of Child Health” will provide a cutting-edge research opportunities, combined with a carefully
constructed mentoring and career development pathway, to enable our Scholars to emerge as leaders among
the ranks of pediatric academic investigators. The basic biomedical research training community at the University
of California San Diego (UCSD) has a long-established reputation of excellence, and UCSD Pediatrics now ranks
in the top five in NIH research funding of all Pediatric Departments in the country. Notably, the last 5-10 years
have witnessed an impressive academic expansion within of the UCSD Department of Pediatrics and the
research it conducts, coupled with the formalization of its partnership with Rady Children's Hospital San Diego,
the largest Children's Hospital in California. The key objectives of our CHRCDA are as follows: (1) To increase
the number Pediatrician-Scientists engaged in basic research as applied to children's health; (2) to attract
outstanding young pediatricians to UCSD and to facilitate their career development under the guidance of world
class, established investigator-faculty mentors; and (3) to cultivate the early careers of women and minority
investigators in children's health. With close input from the program pioneers in our Department, CHRCDA
Scholars will participate fully in the program of UCSD National Center for Leadership in Academic Medicine
(NCLAM), a longstanding and highly successful junior faculty mentoring program in UC Health Sciences that
provides workshops and longitudinal mentoring in all facets required for successful advancement in academic
medicine, and diversity enrichment modules including the Border Health and Doc-for-A-Day programs. All
CHRCDA program faculty mentors are highly regarded scientific investigators, each leading a vibrant and
cutting-edge basic or basic/translational research program of strong relevance to pediatric medicine. Research
training opportunities for CHRCDA Scholars are organized into six research themes of five members each, which
an integral role in the program structure, curriculum and mentorship approach: (1) Genomics, Big Data &
Systems Biology; (2) Infection, Immunity & Inflammation; (3) Organ Physiology & Metabolism; (4) Neuroscience
& Brain Development; (5) Human Microbiome & Child Health; and (6) Developmental & Stem Cell Biology. A
guiding philosophy of this CHRCDA will be to support the greatest possible number of young physician-scientists
within this Program, and an additional year of Department-funded support has been added to three years of K12

10802341,"Summary
Many central neurons release neuromodulatory transmitters, for example monoamines, neuropeptides,
and neurotrophins, from their somata and dendrites. Release of these transmitters is followed by G-protein
coupled receptor activation, and these neuromodulator pathways are essential for brain development and
function. Dopamine signaling in the ventral midbrain is a prominent example of this transmission mode, and it is
particularly important for the response to drugs of abuse.
The knowledge of somatodendritic release and G-protein coupled receptor-mediated transmission lags far
behind that of synaptic signaling, but it is often considered slow and imprecise. The long-term goal of this
project is to determine the molecular mechanisms that mediate somatodendritic dopamine transmission.
We hypothesize that somatodendritic dopamine secretion is mediated by mechanistically specialized machinery
for fast and synchronous release. We propose that this machinery is assembled into release hotspots to generate
a signal with rapid kinetics that is directed towards G-protein coupled receptor domains on target cells, an
architecture ideally suited for robust receptor activation. Our recent work has made first progress towards this
goal. We have found that RIM, a protein important for the spatiotemporal precision of axonal transmitter release,
is essential for evoked somatodendritic dopamine release. Furthermore, we found that synaptotagmin-1, a fast
Ca2+ sensor, mediates Ca2+-triggering of this form of release.
We here propose to determine the organization and function of somatodendritic dopamine release machinery
using conditional mouse gene knockout, electrophysiology, imaging and superresolution microscopy. In aim 1,
we propose to dissect somatodendritic release site architecture in midbrain dopamine neurons. We will
systematically test the necessity and localization of five key active zone protein families that control speed and
location of exocytosis at classical synapses. In aim 2, we propose to identify Ca2+ sources and sensors for
somatodendritic dopamine release. We will assess conditional mouse mutants that lack Ca2+ channel or Ca2+
sensor proteins for secretory deficits and will assess the localization of the proteins needed for Ca2+-triggering
in the somatodendritic compartments. These aims will define mechanisms of Ca2+-triggering and are likely to
identify active zone-like release hotspots. Our work will further reveal shared and distinct release mechanisms
in somatodendritic and axonal compartments of dopamine neurons.
This multi-PI project will advance the understanding of somatodendritic dopamine signaling in the midbrain
specifically, and of G-protein coupled receptor-mediated transmission in general. It combines the expertise of
the laboratories of John Williams and Pascal Kaeser. In-depth studies of these mechanisms will allow us to
derive principles and specifications of these neuronal secretory pathways and may ultimately help advancing
treatments for diseases with disrupted dopamine function, for example drug addiction."

Protein signaling networks are used by cells to sense, process, and respond to physical and molecular features
in their external environment. Engineering artificial signaling networks that couple membrane receptor-mediated
sensing of disease-associated signals to therapeutic responses could lead to breakthroughs in the development
of dynamic cell-based therapeutic devices capable of autonomously detecting and treating disease. In contrast
to native signaling networks, which rely on phosphorylation to transduce external signals, current approaches
for constructing synthetic signaling networks in humans rely on nonnative regulatory mechanisms and operate
on slow timescales or via single-turnover events. As a consequence, it is challenging to construct sense-and-
respond programs that accurately couple environmental fluctuations to output response, or that can flexibly in-
corporate diverse receptor-mediated inputs. The ability to engineer phosphorylation-based sense-and-response
programs could enable functional behavior resembling native pathways, including rapid detecting and integration
of extracellular signals. By enabling fine-tuned discrimination between different extracellular environments, such
programs could enhance safety and efficacy profiles of cell-based therapies. In this project, we will establish a
generalizable approach for engineering synthetic phosphorylation-based signaling in human cells, laying a foun-
dation for next-generation cell therapy devices capable of sensing molecular cues associated with disease, and
converting them into quantitatively defined therapeutic responses. To accomplish our goals, we will leverage a
synthetic biology platform recently developed by our lab that enables bottom-up construction of synthetic phos-
phorylation circuitry using engineered signaling proteins. As our preliminary work demonstrates, this platform
can be used to create synthetic signaling pathways connecting receptor-mediated detection of extracellular mol-
ecules to activation of downstream cellular processes (e.g., transcription). Here, we will investigate if this platform
can be used to engineer sense-and respond program to treat inflammatory disease. Specifically, we will: 1)
demonstrate the ability of synthetic pathways to be wired to receptors that sense diverse biomolecular cues
associated with inflammation; 2) engineer signaling networks that integrate multiple signals and respond exclu-
sively in the presence of defined combinations of inflammatory cues and; 3) test pathways in mesenchymal
stromal cells (MSCs) to assess translatability of our platform. Our work will illuminate foundational principles for
engineering synthetic signaling circuits and deliver a powerful technology platform for creating customized
sense-and-respond programs that can precisely distinguish between features of healthy and diseased tissue. In
addition to disease monitoring and diagnostic applications, these precision cell-based therapy devices could be
used treat diseases ranging from inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, to tissue trauma and cancer."

Protein degradation is tightly regulated by ATP-dependent compartmental proteases of the AAA+ family. The
major AAA+ protease in eukaryotic cells is the 26S proteasome, a 35-subunit complex that degrades proteins
marked with poly-ubiquitin chains and controls protein homeostasis as well as numerous vital processes.
Despite the proteasome’s great importance for cell viability, its detailed mechanisms for substrate selection
and processing, and in particular its regulation and fine-tuning, for instance by substrate-attached ubiquitin
chains, remain largely elusive. During the past granting period, we were able to significantly advance our
understanding of proteasome structure and function. We solved high-resolution structures of the substrate-
engaged proteasome at different stages of the ATP-hydrolysis cycle, established the first complete kinetic
picture of substrate degradation, revealed how major conformational changes of the proteasome are coupled
to individual steps of substrate processing, and uncovered how these conformational transitions are in part
regulated by interactions between proteasomal subcomplexes. Our biochemical tools, recombinant expression
systems, and site-specific fluorescence-labeling strategies put us into a unique position to tackle the numerous
outstanding questions about ubiquitin-mediated protein turnover, the molecular mechanisms of the 26S
proteasome and other AAA+ motors, and the regulation of pathways connected to the ubiquitin-proteasome
system. Especially our newly established single-molecule FRET-based assays allow unprecedented studies of
substrate interactions and progression through the proteasome regulatory particle, as well as the
conformational dynamics of the proteasome. Exciting preliminary data indicate that substrate-attached ubiquitin
chains affect the conformational switching, the kinetics of substrate engagement and degradation, and the
unfolding power of the proteasome depending on the chain length and linkage type. A primary goal is to
investigate how the proteasome utilizes its three main ubiquitin receptors and allosteric networks between
proteasomal subcomplexes to read out this “ubiquitin code” and fine-tune its activities. We will employ a
multidisciplinary approach that includes in-vitro biochemical, single-molecule, and atomic-resolution structural
studies. A pathway upstream of the 26S proteasome is the AAA+ protein unfoldase Cdc48 (p97/VCP in
human). In a new research direction, we will use fluorescence- and FRET-based assays combined with a
series of differentially ubiquitinated and labeled model proteins to investigate how Cdc48 in complex with its
adaptor Ufd1/Npl4 engages and unfolds its substrates, and how the dynamics of Cdc48-adaptor interactions
determine substrate delivery, unfolding, and deubiquitination. Besides advancing our general understanding of
ubiquitin-dependent protein unfolding and degradation, our research also has substantial medical relevance
and offers great potential for the development of new small-molecule drugs, as both the 26S proteasome and
p97 fulfill numerous regulatory functions in all cells and play important roles in various human diseases."

In this competitive renewal of the Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA Institutional Research Training Grant Application,
we request funds to support the research training in environmental toxicology at the University of California
Riverside. The proposed interdisciplinary research training program is built upon the solid foundation of the
existing curriculum structure of the environmental toxicology graduate program. The eighteen preceptors are
from the Division of Biomedical Sciences as well as the Departments of Chemistry, Biochemistry, Botany and
Plant Science, MCSB (Molecular, Cell and Systems Biology), and Environmental Sciences. They have been
very actively engaged in training pre- and postdoctoral individuals in environmental toxicology, and their research
projects have been well funded. The research programs of these faculty members include genetic toxicology
and epigenetics, analytical chemistry and proteomics, developmental toxicology, and endocrine disruption and
metabolism. Pre-doctoral trainees will be selected from the participating Chemistry and Environmental
Toxicology graduate programs. An Internal Steering Committee is established to select trainees and monitor
progress of trainees, and an External Advisory Board is also named to assist the management of the training
program. A total of 9 trainees per year (7 pre-doctorates + 2 postdoctorates) are requested. The trainees will be
exposed to multi-disciplinary research involving a variety of cutting-edge technologies in nanofabrication,
genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc. The request for continued funding of this research training grant is
justified by the relevance of the proposed research training to environmental health, the excellent training
environment, the superb training experience of the preceptors, the strong institutional commitment, the diverse
graduate student body at the University, as well as our success in recruiting, appointing and nurturing the
success of trainees in the last two funding cycles."
10846644,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The “Tools for Transmission of Agents and Conditions (TRAC)” program will synergize statistical and
mathematical modeling work in three areas of application: 1) Tuberculosis (TB) incidence and transmission; 2)
monitoring substance use disorder (SUD) patterns; and 3) SARS CoV-2 transmission modeling. These three
conditions are major public health problems, with TB being the leading cause of infectious disease death globally,
SUD causing more deaths in the United States than HIV/AIDS in its peak, and SARS CoV-2 causing a pandemic
with societal disruption and mortality exceeding anything we have experienced in the last century. We need
improved analytical tools that leverage existing data to monitor these diseases, infer transmission hot spots,
determine the efficacy of interventions, and understand the burden of these conditions.
This program will bring together an expert group of quantitative researchers with skills that are readily applied to
these problems. We also leverage our strong collaborations with clinician researchers and public health officials
to ensure that the methods we develop are addressing important questions and consistent with our current
understanding of these diseases. By creating a program to facilitate communication between these experts, we
will enable greater innovation in modeling key aspects of these diseases and create exciting methodological
synergies across diseases. Our team is well positioned to incorporate data from emerging technologies, including
high throughput sequencing data to determine TB risk signatures and inform transmission links for TB and SARS
CoV-2. Our expertise in machine learning, a broad range of statistical methodologies, and mathematical
modeling will enable us to leverage the rich information in large databases that are emerging to better understand
SUD patterns and identify risk signatures. We will also build infrastructure with our partners to make the analytical
tools that we develop more accessible to public health practitioners and other researchers.
The impact of this work is to develop a suite of analytical tools that leverage rapidly emerging rich data sets to
improve our understanding of disease transmission patterns, monitor changing dynamics of these conditions,
and understand intervention strategies that are most effective. This work will inform public health practice for
these diseases and create reproducible tools that can be used in an ongoing way."

Despite unprecedented clinical success of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy against tumors,
widespread application is limited by lengthy and labor-intensive ex vivo manufacturing procedures that result
in: (i) very high costs of therapy of up to half of a million dollars; (ii) delays of weeks or months to infuse CAR-T
cells to patients with rapidly progressing disease; and (iii) heterogeneous composition and terminal
differentiation of infused CAR-T cells as a result of ex vivo culture that limit CAR-T cell engraftment and
persistence. Effort to overcome these limitations have focused on closed and automatic manufacturing devices
to contain the labor needed to manufacture CAR-T cells ex vivo, and allogeneic off-the-shelf CAR-T cells have
been proposed to overcome the need of CAR-T cell manufacturing for each single patient. Despite significant
achievements in this space, reducing the time, costs and regulatory burden remains a deep unmet need in
CAR-T cell therapy and significant reducing or eliminating ex vivo procedures remains a critical unmet need. In
vivo generation of CAR-T cells would eliminate the need for ex vivo procedures, prevent the terminal
differentiation of ex vivo expanded CAR-T cells and ensure the potency and longevity of autologous T cells as
compared to allogeneic CAR-T cell products that are extensively manipulated to prevent rejection and graft-
versus-host disease The research outlined in this proposal develops new biomaterials approaches to reduce
the time and effort to produce CAR-T cells in vitro, to enhance CAR-T cell efficacy and persistence in vivo and,
finally, to eliminate ex vivo manipulation entirely by generating CAR-T cells entirely within the patient. We
propose that biomaterial scaffolds displaying anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies and releasing pro-proliferative
interleukins will mediate simultaneous activation and viral transduction of T cells without centrifugation
(spinoculation) or transduction agents (retronectin, polybrene) and will facilitate ex vivo genetic reprogramming
of T cells by reducing the time and expense of activating naive T-cells and transducing them with viral vectors.
We next propose that directly implanting scaffolds seeded with peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CAR-
encoding viral vectors will promote release of CAR-T cells into circulation, eliminating ex vivo CAR-T isolation
and proliferation protocols to promote a less differentiated cell phenotype associated with longer in vivo
persistence. Finally, we propose that, through the inclusion of encapsulated T-cell attracting cytokines,
implanted biomaterial scaffolds will generate CAR-T cells entirely in situ through recruitment of host T cells to
the scaffold, in-scaffold reprogramming of recruited T cells with resident CAR-encoding viral vectors, and
release of reprogrammed CAR-T cells. We expect that our results will provide a basis for a general cellular
therapeutic strategy and promote widespread patient access. In addition to the obvious applications in blood
cancers, this rational materials-based approach for cellular manufacturing will be adopted to program
therapeutic lymphocytes in solid tumors and for other diseases."

10792890,"Cerebral vascular malformations affect 1 in 100 to 200 of the general population with increased
risk for stroke, seizures and focal neurological deficits. Patients with inherited autosomal dominant
CCM carry loss of function mutations in one of three genes: CCM1, CCM2 and CCM3 (Pdcd10).
We have focused on CCM3 (Pdcd10) as both humans and mice with CCM3 loss exhibit more
severe phenotype than those with loss of CCM1 or CCM2. Why human CCM lesions are primarily
confined to the brain vasculature, despite ubiquitous expression of CCM proteins, remains unclear.
We have recently established an inducible Ccm3 deletion using a novel brain EC (BEC)-specific
Cre line (Pdcd10BECKO) that promoted CCM lesions in the brain. Importantly, the Pdcd10BECKO mice
survive up to 6-12 months, allowing us to visualize vascular lesion formation by live imaging, to
define the CCM pathogenesis, and to test therapeutics in adulthood. Our previous work shows
that CCM3 suppresses Unc13B-dependent exocytosis-mediated secretion of angiopoietin-2.
More recent study indicates that caveolae vesicle and its core protein caveolin-1 (Cav1) are
tightly controlled by CCM3, and dramatically increased in the brain microvascular ECs of Ccm3-
deficient mice. Since increased caveolae has been associated with increased BBB dysfunction,
we hypothesize that CCM3, by controlling intracellular vesicles in brain microvascular ECs,
regulates BBB integrity; loss of CCM3 induces abnormal vesicle trafficking, particularly caveolae-
mediated transcytosis and protein trafficking, leading to BBB dysfunction and vascular
malformation. We propose the following three specific aims and studies: 1) To determine the
contribution of caveolae and Cav1-mediated signaling to brain vascular malformations. We will
determine if Cav1 genetic defect prevents CCM lesion in Pdcd10BECKO mice, characterize BBB
function and caveolae-mediated transcytosis, characterize EC-pericyte association and EC lumen
dilation in DKO, and characterize novel gene expression and signaling pathways related to BBB
structure and function by single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) analyses; 2) To define the mechanism
by which CCM3 regulates Cav1-Tie2 signaling and vascular stabilization. We will perform
biochemical and imaging experiments to determine if CCM3-regulated Tie2 is caveolae-specific,
determine the role of CCM3-Cav1-Tie2 signaling in regulating EC junction, EC-pericyte
association and vascular stabilization by in vitro models; 3) To determine the therapeutic effects
of Cav1-Tie2 signaling in CCM disease progression. We will test therapeutic effects of Tie2
inhibitor, genetic deletion of Tie2 on CCM disease, define Tie2-mediated gene expression and
signaling pathways by scRNA-seq, and determine the role of Tie2high ECs in CCM lesion formation."
10745349,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Individuals with type II diabetes (T2DM) and metabolic syndrome (MS) display decreased activity of peroxisome
proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and often develop salt-sensitive hypertension (SS HT). PPARγ
activation by thiazolidinediones (TZDs) lowers blood pressure in T2DM and MS. Moreover, PPARγ impairment
caused by dominant negative mutations (e.g. P467L) that block PPARγ activation by ligands cause severe early
onset HT in humans, while selective expression of these mutations in vascular smooth muscle (VSM)
recapitulates human HT in mice (S-P467L), suggesting impairment of vascular PPARγ is causal. Using S-P467L
mice as a model of vascular PPARγ impairment, I have provided compelling preliminary data supporting an
innovative concept that the detrimental effects of PPARγ impairment in VSM may be mediated by enhanced
PGE2/E-Prostanoid Receptor 3 (EP3) signaling in pre-glomerular resistance vessels (interlobular artery and
afferent arterioles), causing increased renal vascular resistance and blunted renal blood flow during excess salt
loading. The blunted renal perfusion is associated with decreased intrarenal nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and
increased sodium retention in S-P467L mice fed a 4% high salt diet. We and others have previously published
that vascular PPARγ prevents oxidative stress through transcriptional regulation of antioxidant genes. Loss of
PPARγ-mediated antioxidant responses may decrease NO bioavailability in renal microvessels through an
imbalance between NO and reactive oxygen species such as superoxide. The goal of this K01 award is to
investigate the renal mechanisms of salt sensitivity caused by the impairment of vascular PPARγ. Aim 1 will test
the hypotheses that a) impairment of vascular PPARγ blunts renal blood flow by enhancing PGE2/EP3 signaling
in renal microvessels, and b) pharmacological inhibition of EP3 decreases renal vascular resistance, improves
renal perfusion, and attenuates SS HT during PPARγ impairment. Aim 2 will test the hypotheses that a) impaired
vascular PPARγ results in decreased NOS-mediated NO generation and/or impaired antioxidant defense in the
kidney, and b) intrarenal NO deficiency impairs natriuresis and contributes to SS HT during PPARγ impairment.
Successful completion of the mentored scientist development grant will allow me to acquire necessary skills and
expertise to transition to independence in the academia of hypertension research focusing on renal vascular
biology, redox biology, and tubular physiology."
10795964,"Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease caused by reduced expression
of the mitochondrial protein frataxin (FXN). Frataxin is translated as a 210 amino acid (aa) precursor (FXN-P)
that is imported into the mitochondrial matrix where it undergoes sequential cleavage steps, producing a 168 aa
intermediate (FXN-I) and the mature isoform of 129 aa (FXN-M). Frataxin participates in iron-sulfur cluster (ISC)
biosynthesis in the mitochondria, and many of the overt FRDA phenotypes result from deficient activity of ISC-
containing enzymes. Currently, there is no cure for this debilitating disease. Most FRDA patients are
homozygous for large expansions of GAA triplet repeat sequences in intron 1 of the FXN gene, while a subset
of patients are compound heterozygotes with an expanded GAA repeat tract in one FXN allele and a missense
or nonsense mutation in the other. Homozygous and compound heterozygous mutant genotypes both result in
reduced levels of FXN-M protein when compared with healthy controls. The most prevalent missense mutation
changes a glycine to valine at position 130 (G130V). FRDA G130V patients exhibit different clinical features than
patients harboring homozygous GAA expansions, including lower limb spasticity rather than ataxia, preserved
sensory responses, spared speech and upper limb functions, and slower disease progression. Paradoxically,
substantially less FXN-M protein is detectable in G130V patient samples than in patient samples harboring two
expanded alleles. Our preliminary data revealed that normal mitochondrial maturation processing of the FXN
protein is perturbed by the G130V mutation, suggesting functional importance of an intermediate isoform
(G130V-I). We hypothesize that the G130V mutation impairs FXN mitochondrial maturation processing and/or
destabilizes the mature isoform. The unprocessed FXN-G130V-I isoform is functional and partially compensates
for the substantial reduction of FXN-M, thus slowing disease progression and contributing to the distinct
symptoms of FRDA G130V patients. To address these hypotheses, we will use novel cellular and mouse models
of FRDA G130V. First, we will define the structural and functional properties of the FXN-G130V-I isoform to test
whether this mutation confers a change of function that contributes to the atypical clinical presentation of FRDA
G130V patients. Subsequently, we will determine mechanisms governing steady state levels and maturation
processing of FXN-G130V in iPSC-derived cortical and sensory neurons. Finally, using FRDA patient-derived
neuronal models as well as our novel Fxn G127V mouse model, we will define molecular mechanisms underlying
the unique clinical presentation of FRDA G130V patients. Results of the proposed studies will have a broad
impact on therapy development for all FRDA patients."
10912431,"Approximately 37.1 million adults 18 years or older (14.7% of all U.S. adults) are estimated to have diabetes,
where 90-95% of cases are classified as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Adults from racial/ethnic minority
groups continue to be disproportionately impacted by higher morbidity and mortality and poor outcomes
compared to Non-Hispanic White adults. The reasons for these disparities among population groups remain
elusive; however, structural racism, defined as the laws, policies, institutional practices, and entrenched
norms embedded within society that foster discrimination through mutually reinforcing inequitable systems, has
been indicated as a root cause of inequities in health outcomes including those related to diabetes. One form
of structural racism, historic redlining, known as the practice of denying resources to communities based on
race, largely impacts neighborhoods populated by persons from racial and ethnic minority groups where
diabetes is highly prevalent. It has led to social and economic disadvantage within hyper-segregated and
under-resourced neighborhoods due to community disinvestment. Despite reportedly being banned decades
ago, the relationship between historic redlining and contemporary diabetes outcomes has not been well-
studied. Since current evidence supports an association between redlining and population health, this
is a significant gap that needs to be addressed to reduce diabetes disparities. Preliminary data from
our group shows people report that current studies do not account for their lived experiences or
accommodate for the structural inequities they deal with that limits their ability to self-manage
diabetes. Therefore, we propose to assess the role of structural racism, in the form of historic
redlining, on diabetes disparities and how it impacts current-day clinical and behavioral outcomes,
quality of life, and the neighborhood environment in 2,000 adults with T2DM. This study offers a unique
opportunity to bridge a gap in knowledge within the field by using an experimental convergent mixed
methods study design to understand the relationship between historic redlining and diabetes-related
outcomes in adults with T2DM. Aim 1 will use qualitative research methods to explore beliefs and attitudes
about historic redlining and its impact on diabetes self-management and outcomes. Aim 2 will use quantitative
research methods to identify direct and indirect pathways through which historic redlining impacts diabetes-
related outcomes (glycemic control, blood pressure control, lipid control, self-care behaviors (diet, physical
activity, medication adherence, blood glucose monitoring), and quality of life) in adults with T2DM and
investigate invariance by race/ethnicity and sex/gender in the relationship. Aim 3 will use hierarchical modeling
to assess the impact of individual, interpersonal, and neighborhood level factors on individual level diabetes
outcomes; to assess the contribution of historic redlining exposure toward noted neighborhood level
associations; and to assess whether individual level associations are moderated by historic redlining exposure."
10897106,"Research Objective: The objective of our proposed research is to identify patients with rheumatoid arthritis
associated interstitial lung disease (RA-ILD) that are at the highest risk for progressive disease and may
potentially benefit from more targeted, and potentially less harmful, treatment. Unmet Health Need: Deaths
from RA-ILD are not improving despite an overall decline in RA mortality. Novel, noninvasive methods are
urgently needed to identify those with progressive RA-ILD so that interventions can delay the development of
end-stage lung disease. Rationale: RA-ILD is a heterogeneous condition and the majority will experience
disease progression resulting in lung transplantation and/or death. Despite the heterogeneity of RA-ILD, all
RA-ILD is treated the same without taking in to account the known heterogeneity of this disease. This
immunosuppressive-based treatment approach has led to unpredictable natural histories, inconsistent
responses to treatment, and ultimately irreversible fibrosis leading to increased symptom burden, worse quality
of life, and ultimately death. Hypothesis: Our overall hypothesis is that novel quantitative imaging and specific
blood markers will be associated with a progressive phenotype in RA-ILD. Aims: We will evaluate the role of
novel quantitative imaging (Specific Aim 1), peripheral blood telomere length (Specific Aim 2) and peripheral
blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) gene expression (Specific Aim 3) in predicting progressive RA-ILD as defined
by 12-month change in FVC% predicted. We will also explore the overlap and additive strength of each of
these predictors in a composite profile (Specific Aim 4). Approach: To achieve the proposed aims, we will
recruit 364 subjects with RA-ILD at the time of ILD diagnosis by an ILD pulmonologist and prior to treatment
with lung-specific immunosuppression. Recruitment will occur at 4 expert ILD centers across the country with
longitudinal collection of clinical, physiologic, and radiologic data with collection of serial biospecimens. The
overall goal of this proposal is to identify the subset of RA-ILD patients that are at highest risk for disease
progression following diagnosis by using novel imaging and specific blood markers. This risk stratification will
help us determine whether or not immunosuppression should be started on an RA-ILD patient at the time of
diagnosis. This knowledge will ultimately lead to less harm to patients with RA-ILD by decreasing exposure to
immunosuppression in the subset that is most vulnerable. This proposal will lead to future precision-medicine
based investigations for RA-ILD treatment and will lay the foundation to perform clinical trials that will
determine the role of additional treatment pathways (e.g., observation, antifibrotic therapy, novel therapeutics
and/or combination therapy) in RA-ILD, leading to reduction in harm and delaying the development of end-
stage lung disease."

Electrification of the transportation sector in the United States, crucial for climate change mitigation, is
projected to have considerable co-benefits for public health through reductions in tailpipe-related emission.
Numerous studies have estimated impacts on air quality and a few on health outcomes under various
hypothetical scenarios—but no study to date has evaluated the broad real-world impacts of current rapidly
increasing electric vehicle (EV) adoption levels. Further, there a serious concern is that EV adoption is not
equitably distributed across the population. We propose to study inequities in EV adoption and in the observed
local air quality and respiratory health co-benefits of EV adoption, using a sequential qualitative  quantitative
 qualitative mixed methods design which melds community-engaged research with traditional
epidemiological data analyses of large statewide databases in CA. We will first conduct focus group
discussions with community members of the Southeast Los Angeles region, in collaboration with our
community partner, to better understand perceived barriers and possible opportunities for promoting adoption
of EVs in underserved communities (Aim 1a). Data from these focus group discussions will be used to refine
our preliminary conceptual framework for EV adoption and identify additional hypotheses for testing in
subsequent quantitative aims. Next, key predictive factors of neighborhood-level EV adoption in CA will be
characterized using real-world data on EV registration (Aim 1b). Then, we will evaluate the effect of observed
local EV adoption on measured tailpipe-related air pollutant concentrations (fine particulate matter [PM2.5] and
nitrogen dioxide [NO2]) and assess potential effect measure modification by neighborhood/contextual factors
(Aim 2). Finally, we will examination associations of EV adoption with local ED visits and hospitalization for
pediatric and adult asthma and COPD, again assessing for potential effect measure modification by
neighborhood/ contextual factors (Aim 3). Sustained bidirectional community engagement is built in across the
entire study period. In addition to focus group discussions, the community engagement plan includes annual
community dialogues and Advisory Council meetings and a final community report back meeting. Our multi-
pronged approach for community engagement is expected to enhance the relevance, validity, and impact of
research findings. Study findings will provide policymakers with valuable real-world evidence on air quality and
health co-benefits of the EV transition and empower communities with documented inequities in the transition,
facilitating future research to mitigate these effects and reduce future environment and health disparities."
10834995,"Cochlear implants (Cl) can restore audibility, speech understanding, and communication abilities for adults with hearing loss receiving limited benefit from hearing aids, thereby improving quality of life. Despite the success of Cls, there remains wide variability in performance related to both patient and treatment factors. Biographical/audiological variables such as age, age at onset, duration, etiology, and severity of hearing loss as well as duration of hearing aid and Cl use together with surgical factors have long been used to predict speech perception performance. These variables account for only 10-20% of the variability in speech perception test scores in quiet, implying they are poor biomarkers of auditory system suitability for Cl stimulation. Recent studies demonstrate that Cl performance in background noise is worse in the elderly, in part, related to age-dependent central processing differences. We propose that in adult Cl candidates, accurate assessment of both the cochlear-neural and central auditory substrates can predict performance. Predicting performance has relevance to patient counseling and shared decision making (between clinician and patient), design and recommendations for auditory rehabilitation, consideration for device mapping and troubleshooting, and patient stratification in future clinical trials. Electrocochleography (ECochG) is an acoustically-evoked electrophysiological method to assess the cochlear-neural substrate; responses are present in >95% of Cl recipients, and can account for up to ~50% of open set speech perception scores in quiet. However, the ECochG-total response (ECochG-TR), is necessary but not sufficient to predict speech perception in noise. Adding a preoperative cognitive screener to ECochG-TR improves the prediction model (ΔR2=0.26; R2mode1=0.60). Thus, a good cochlear-neural substrate and cognitive function are both needed for speech understanding in noise. We will use biographical/audiological variables together with preoperative, transtympanic (ttECochG) and/or intraoperative (iECochG) ECochG and surgical factors, to develop clinically useful preoperative and/or postoperative (pre-activation) speech perception prediction models. Aim 1: Determine if preoperative ttECochG-TR is a valid measure of cochlear-neural substrate integrity as it relates to Cl stimulation, compared to the validated iECochG-TR. To this end, we will determine the strength of correlation between ttECochG and: (1a) iECochG-TR and (1 b) implant ear speech perception measures in quiet (6-month). Aim 2: Develop prediction models for implant ear speech perception scores in noise (Primary) and quiet (Secondary) after 6 months of Cl use. Models will include baseline demographic/audiologic variables, cognitive measures plus: (2a) Preoperative ttECochG-TR in the clinic; (2b) Postoperative (pre-activation) iECochG-TR and surgical factors from post-implant CT imaging. Aim 3: Establish the generalizability (external validation) of the prediction models in a geographically separate location (Vanderbilt University) from Washington University in St. Louis as patient and surgical factors can vary across sites."

Obesity is a leading risk factor for type 2 diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular
diseases. A central driver of pathogenesis in obesity-associated disorders is the insufficient lipid-storing
capacity of adipocytes and subsequent lipid deposition in extra-adipose organs. The lipid droplet (LD) is the
organelle responsible for lipid storage and mobilization in adipocytes. It remains to be elucidated whether
proteins and pathways regulating LD structure and function constitute limiting factors governing the lipid-storing
capacity of adipocytes, and thus play an essential role in determining one’s susceptibility to obesity-associated
disorders. We observed that mice deficient in CLSTN3B, a mammalian adipocyte-specific protein, are more
prone to high-fat diet-induced metabolic disorders compared with body weight-matched wild-type mice,
whereas the adipose-specific clstn3b transgenic mice display the opposite phenotype. Preliminary evidence
shows that CLSTN3B localizes to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/LD contact sites and ablation of CLSTN3B
results in an impaired coating of LDs by phospholipids and proteins. Our overall objectives are to (i) establish
the significance of CLSTN3B expressed in white adipocytes to the metabolic phenotype; (ii) reveal the
molecular mechanism of CLSTN3B action at the ER/LD contact sites. The central hypothesis is that CLSTN3B
enhances the structural and functional integrity of LDs, improves white adipocyte lipid-storing capacity, and
contributes to the maintenance of metabolic health under obese conditions; mechanistically, this is achieved by
replenishing LD surface phospholipids and promoting the binding of LD-targeting proteins. We will test this
hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Show that CLSTN3B expressed in white adipocytes is the main
contributor to the metabolic benefits upon high-fat diet feeding; 2) Show that CLSTN3B promotes
phospholipids transfer between ER and LD; 3) Probe the role of the C-terminal ER luminal segment of
CLSTN3B in the formation of ER/LD contacts. For the first aim, we will construct genetic models allowing
specific assessment of white adipocyte-derived CLSTN3B. For the second aim, we will design in vitro
reconstituted phospholipid transfer assays and examine the functional significance of LD surface phospholipid
density. For the third aim, we will use biochemical approaches to identify potential binding partners of the ER
luminal C-terminal fragment of CLSTN3B, followed by assessing the significance of such interactions using
cellular and animal models. The proposed research is innovative because it dissects the molecular mechanism
of a novel protein and explains susceptibility to obesity-associated disorders from a novel perspective. The
proposed research is significant because it aims to establish an integrated understanding encompassing
interorganelle communication and metabolic physiology at the organismal level. Our long-term goal is to use
CLSTN3B as a molecular handle to derive a thorough understanding of ER/LD interactions in the specific
context of adipocytes and identify novel therapeutic targets for obesity-associated diseases."

The response to systemic infection and tissue injury requires the rapid adaptation of hematopoietic stem cells
(HSCs) in the bone marrow, which proliferate and divert their differentiation towards the myeloid lineage.
Significant interest has emerged in understanding the signals that trigger this emergency hematopoietic
program. However, the mechanisms that terminate this response of the HSCs and restore tissue
homeostasis remain unknown. The clinical success of proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib, and E3 ubiquitin
ligase glues for the treatment of hematologic diseases has made the Ubiquitin pathway a bona fide target for
cancer therapeutics. Thus, defining how novel E3 ligases function in the bone marrow and investigating their
specific roles in normal and emergency hematopoiesis can lead to novel therapeutic interventions. We have
demonstrated that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Spop restrains the inflammatory activation of HSCs. In the absence
of Spop, systemic inflammation proceeds in an unresolved manner and the sustained response in the HSCs
results in a lethal phenotype reminiscent of hyper-inflammatory syndrome. Our proteomic/biochemical
studies demonstrated that Spop restricts inflammation by targeting the signal transducer Myd88 for
proteasome-dependent degradation. Myd88 accumulation in conjunction with an inflammatory stimulus leads
to Myddosome formation, the hyper-phosphorylation of the Irak4 kinase and activation of a number of
transcription factor pathways (NF-kB, Jun, Pu.1, Cebpb). This proposal defines: (a) the transcriptional and
chromatin landscape changes imposed during initiation and termination of emergency hematopoiesis in the
bone marrow HSC and progenitor cells, (b) the role of the myddosome assembly, signaling and termination
in emergency hematopoiesis and gene regulation and (c) the structural details of myddosome assembly and
termination. The findings of this grant proposal will uncover HSC-intrinsic mechanisms essential for
reestablishing homeostasis following emergency hematopoiesis."
10872219,"Estimates suggest that one in five transgender girls may be HIV positive In the face of this health
disparity, the near-complete absence of gender-inclusive healthy sexuality programs is deafening. To address
the lack of gender inclusive HIV prevention programming, we propose to develop and test
#TranscendentHealth. Content will focus on providing girls with a panoply of risk reduction strategies, including
frequent HIV/STI testing and initiating PrEP, so that they can choose options that fit best for them. Messaging
will be gender affirming while increasing one’s HIV preventive information, motivation, and behavioral skills.
Content will foster pride in girls’ gender identity and reduce internalized transphobia they may be experiencing.
We will harness the reach and wide adoption of text messaging among youth to deliver intervention content.
This national reach will increase its generalizability and translational properties.
 In response to RFA-OD-19-029, this proposal addresses NIMH’s high priority area of research:
Intervention research to improve HIV prevention and treatment outcomes for transgender individuals that
focuses on the influences of sex and gender (Strategic Goal 1.3). Specifically, we aim to:
 Specific Aim 1: Explore how the intersectionality of sex and gender inform the sexual decision
making of transgirls 14-18 years of age (n=80). Little is known about how transgirls decide when and with
whom to have sex or not, as well as how their understanding of their gender within the context of their sex
influences their sexual decision-making. To explore these issues, we will conduct online focus groups.
 Specific Aim 2: Iteratively develop #TranscendentHealth, a gender inclusive HIV prevention
program for transgirls, with ongoing input from transgirls (n=35). We will integrate findings from the focus
groups into content tailored to the lived experiences of transgirls 14-18 years of age. To ensure that the
messaging is affirming and acceptable, we then will conduct Content Advisory Teams (CATs), and then t a
beta test to confirm the protocol.
 Specific Aim 3: Test the #TranscendentHealth HIV prevention program with transgirls 14-18
years of age across the United States (n=200). Our main outcome measures will be feasibility and
acceptability. Behavioral outcomes will be exploratory and include those on the HIV prevention continuum41: 1)
acceptability of, 2) motivation for, and 3) uptake of PrEP, if clinically indicated; and 3) HIV/STI testing and
receipt of results at 3-month follow-up. Photo-verified testing also will be explored.
 Specific Aim 4: Understand how the intersectionality of sex and gender impact the intervention
experience. We will examine whether transgirls who are undergoing gender affirming hormone therapy, have
internalized transphobia, and different gender identities experience the intervention differently than other
gender minority teens."
10896134,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Currently, over 70% of the U.S. adult population is overweight or obese, and this number is only increasing. Even
more alarming is that 1 in 6 children is now overweight or obese, a number that has been rising even more
rapidly than the adult population. While lifestyle modifications and gastric bypass surgeries are proven
approaches to reducing adiposity and metabolic dysfunction, there is still no sign that obesity and its co-
morbidities are abating. Safe, new strategies to mitigate weight gain, in combination with lifestyle choices, may
prove more effective than any one strategy alone. Our long-term goal for this Catalyst project is to develop an
obesity-mitigating strategy that leverages the activities of the gut microbiome to selectively target visceral
adipose depots. Our rationale for this is based on recent findings from my lab while studying Crohn’s disease.
We reported that certain lipid-loving bacteria and fungi in the gut, can translocate from the gut to mesenteric
visceral adipose tissue in Crohn’s disease patients. The interaction of these microorganisms in the adipose
tissue, promoted tissue expansion and the phenomenon known as ‘creeping fat’ (Ha et al., Cell 2020). Many
features of Crohn’s creeping fat appear similar to obese visceral adipose. Therefore, if microbes may be a potent
driver of creeping fat, perhaps they are a potent driver of visceral adiposity in obesity. Our approach to this
question will involve the use of human gastric bypass tissues to first characterize the microbial presence in these
tissues, and then test these organisms prospectively in gnotobiotic mice. We will in parallel create iPSC-derived
organoids from obese patients to test specific host-microbe cellular interactions. This contribution is innovative
because it poses a radically new, fringe concept that gut bacteria are directly interacting with adipose tissue to
influence its behavior. If so, we may be able to target these specific organisms in the gut before they translocate,
which we propose could be achieved through phage-mediated killing rather than antibiotics. It is high-risk
because there is no established body of literature to support the notion that bacteria are directly driving the
behavior of adipose through cell-cell interactions, but if it proves to be true, will necessitate a paradigm shift in
how we think about obesity. Finally, the contribution is significant, because it may open entirely new avenues for
maintaining metabolic health in the population, and particularly in our most vulnerable, pediatric population."
10809720,"We currently have a very limited understanding of the factors, either genetic or immune-related, conferring
protection to clinical Plasmodium vivax (Pv) malaria. Deciphering the mechanisms underlying such protection
would allow the design of tailored intervention strategies for the elimination of Pv. Production of anti-Pv Duffy
Binding Protein (DBP) binding-inhibitory antibodies (BIabs) is associated to functional and protective
immunity against Pv malaria. Only a minority of individuals develops such antibodies and the mechanisms
enabling their production are unknown. Individuals not producing BIabs can still be protected against Pv
clinical malaria indicating that additional immunological and/or genetic factors can confer protection.
Leveraging a longitudinal cohort we have constituted in endemic area of Cambodia, we have identified
individuals displaying remarkable clinical protection against Pv and the overall goal of this proposal aims
at characterizing the factors enabling such protection. The first specific aim (SA1) will be to understand
the factors that drive the production of anti-PvDBP BIabs and therefore further clinical protection against Pv.
By phenotyping and functionally characterizing DBP-specific CD4+ T cells and B cells in naturally infected
participants with characterized amounts of BIabs, we will have a better understanding of the adaptive immune
response of individuals leading to the production of naturally-acquired anti-PvDBP BIabs. On the other hand,
by characterizing the PvDBP allelic polymorphism and isoforms produced by isolates collected from
individuals with various levels of BIabs, we will determine if parasite genetic factors are also contributing to
the acquisition of BIabs. The second and third SA will be to decipher the genetic (SA2) or immune (SA3)
factors leading to protection against Pv malaria for individuals not producing anti-PvDBP BIabs. In SA2, we
will compare the gene expression profiles and genotypes of parasites isolated from chronically-infected
asymptomatic individuals and from symptomatic treatment-seeking patients to identify parasite factors
differentiating these two drastically different clinical outcomes. We will also determine the human erythrocyte
proteins’ polymorphism of individuals displaying contrasted clinical outcome of infection to identify host
genetic factors conferring protection. Any host polymorphism identified will be functionally tested in vitro for
Pv invasion/development alterations. In SA3, we will identify host immune factors associated to protection
from clinical Pv malaria. Using the same patient cohort as SA2, we will study ex vivo and in vitro the immune
responses in Pv-infected patients. Using single cell cultures of antigen-specific B cells, we aim to identify
novel humoral targets on the Pv merozoite or iRBC that could be involved in conferring protection from clinical
Pv malaria trough blockade of invasion or alternative antibody effector functions."

The purpose of this NIH F31 application is to obtain support for the PI, W. Jay Stone, for mentored research and
career development activities within his MD/PhD degree training that will strengthen his potential to become a
successful physician scientist. The project goal is to develop skills in neuroscience that will allow the PI to study
key proteins involved in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, including Parkinson’s disease (PD) and
Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB), using laboratory assays foundational to research in neuroscience. The
primary objective of this research proposal is to investigate the role of 14-3-3θ phosphorylation in the context of
environmental toxicant exposure and the neuroinflammatory response associated with synucleinopathies. Work
from the lab of Dr. Talene Yacoubian, sponsor of the PI, has established 14-3-3θ as a key mediator of pathologic
mechanisms by which neurons degenerate in models of PD and DLB, and serves as a potential target for disease
modifying therapy. Furthermore, our lab has revealed that phosphorylation of 14-3-3θ at serine residue 232
(pS232) modulates its ability to interact with and prevent the aggregation of α-syn, the critical pathologic protein
implicated in PD and DLB. However, the events which lead to aberrant pS232 levels are unclear. This project
aims to increase our understanding of the mechanisms that induce pS232 and promote neurodegeneration in
two synucleinopathy-associated events: exposure to the environmental toxicant, trichloroethylene (Aim 1) and
neuroinflammation (Aim 2). The long-term objective of our research is to better understand the role of 14-3-3θ
phosphorylation within synucleinopathies so that subsequent studies can be devised to target 14-3-3θ for
developing potential disease-modifying therapeutics.
The proposed training plan for Jay Stone is sponsored by his project mentor, Dr. Talene Yacoubian, and co-
sponsored by Dr. David Standaert. The overall goal of the training plan is to provide the PI with a solid foundation
for a successful career as a physician scientist. A project based both in translational approaches, while focused
on a disease-oriented pathogenesis, is the ideal training environment for any aspiring physician scientist.
Included in the training plan are experiences that will help Jay develop in three major areas: 1) rigorous
neuroscience research in synucleinopathies, which includes developing familiarity with the existing literature,
critical evaluation of data, and training in the responsible conduct of research; 2) training in advanced gene
therapeutics, and 3) career and professional development, including grant and manuscript writing, scientific
communications, and the translation of research findings to clinical applications. This proposal drives the
development of skills required to conduct rigorous scientific research in synucleinopathies and advanced
neuroscience skills necessary for the PI’s future career as a neurology physician-scientist focused on precision
medicine and neurodegenerative diseases."
10755272,"Food allergy is associated with a hypersensitive type 2 immune response that develops following
sensitization to food proteins. Allergic sensitization elicits the development of adaptive immune memory,
characterized by antigen specific Th2 cells and B-cells which produce antibodies of the IgE and IgG1 isotypes.
IgE antibodies bind to tissue resident mast cells, and these IgE-mast cell units enable a rapid and exuberant
recall response to low quantities of food antigen. Pre-clinical and clinical studies underscore the importance of
IgE antibodies in the gastrointestinal manifestation of food allergy, such as abdominal pain, nausea and
vomiting, however what mast-cells induce to initiate these symptoms is poorly understood. GDF15 is a stress-
induced TGF-b cytokine that mediates anorexia, conditioned taste aversion, and vomiting through its receptor,
GFRAL, located on the area postrema. GDF15 can be induced by type 1 and type 2 inflammation, however its
role in the context of food allergy is unclear. The objective of this proposal is to study the role of GDF15-
GFRAL signaling in driving avoidance behavior to food allergens in allergic mice. Preliminary data in in vivo
food allergy models demonstrates GDF15 is rapidly induced upon allergen challenge in a manner largely
dependent on IgE, FceR1a expressing cells, and leukotrienes. Using qPCR and FISH of the small intestine
and colon from food allergen challenged mice, we find that colonic, but not small intestinal, crypt epithelial
cells are enriched in GDF15 transcripts. Interestingly, acute pharmacological blockade of GDF15 ameliorates
food allergen aversion in a two-bottle preference test behavioral paradigm. This data suggests that IgE-
mediated mast cell activation elicits colonic epithelial GDF15 production, potentially through leukotrienes, to
drive allergen aversion. To test this hypothesis two aims will be pursued. Aim 1 will examine the effect of
genetic deficiency of GDF15 and GFRAL on food allergen avoidance in vivo using newly generated KO mice
on the food allergy susceptible BALB/cJ background strain. GDF15 and GFRAL deficiency’s effect on mast-
cell mediated immune responses in experimental food allergy will also be characterized. Aim 2 will examine
how IgE mediated mast cell activation initiates GDF15-GFRAL signaling in experimental food allergy using
mice genetically or pharmacologically deficient in IgE, mast cells, and leukotrienes. Mast-cell dependent
changes in the transcriptome of colonic epithelial cells will too be quantified. Together, these studies will
enhance our understanding of how type 2 immune responses in the gastrointestinal tract lead to allergen
induced malaise, and may reveal novel targets to prevent complications of oral immunotherapy (OIT).
Alongside these studies, the applicant will complete a program of advanced technical and theoretical
coursework, clinical electives, and scientific skill building. The research and training detailed in this application
will prepare him to pursue a clinically relevant basic science career as a physician scientist."

10799566,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is a debilitating disease that leads to
progressive memory loss, cognitive impairment, and ultimately death. Pathological hallmarks of AD include
extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques. β-secretase-1 (β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, BACE1) is the rate-
limiting enzyme of toxic Aβ generation. Transgenic BACE1 KO mouse models of AD led to suppression of AD
pathology, which suggests that inhibiting BACE1 may be a rational strategy for AD treatment. However, human
clinical trials have shown that BACE1 inhibitors are inefficacious, even worsening cognitive function, among AD
patients. This benchtop-to-bedside translational failure is due to our incomplete understanding of BACE1’s
physiological function. In particular, the mechanisms underlying neuronal and synaptic impairments in BACE1
deficiency or inhibition is poorly understood. In this proposal, we will address this knowledge gap by testing the
hypothesis that BACE1 modulates intrinsic and synaptic neurophysiological properties in a cell-type- and circuit-
specific manner in the hippocampus, a major substrate of memory storage derailed by AD. My preliminary data
of whole-cell patch clamp of hippocampal pyramidal neurons (PNs) show that selective BACE1 deletion in
excitatory neurons leads to neuronal hyperexcitability, suggesting that BACE1 deletion disrupts intrinsic neuronal
function in a cell-autonomous manner. Given my preliminary findings, I hypothesize that BACE1 modulates
excitability and synaptic transmission in hippocampal PNs by the regulation of ion channels – the identities of
which have yet to be fully elucidated. In Aim 1, I will comprehensively determine the ionic basis underlying the
hyperexcitability phenotype in my Excitatory-BACE1-KO mice (mice in which BACE1 is selectively deleted in
excitatory PNs), and characterize the synaptic transmission and plasticity deficits in Excitatory-BACE1-KO,
through patch clamp electrophysiology methods. In Aim 2, I will delineate behavioral deficits Excitatory-BACE1-
KO neurons, and rescue hypothesized cognitive deficits in mutant mice by normalizing PN hyperexcitability
through a chemogenetic approach. The findings from this study will provide insight into neuronal and synaptic
physiology, mechanisms of learning/memory and behavior, and future AD therapeutic strategies. Importantly,
completion of this project will help me master current concepts and state-of-the-art techniques in patch clamp
electrophysiology, behavior studies, and in vivo genetic perturbation and increase my scientific communication
skills through extensive opportunities to present and publish my studies. As an MD/PhD student at UConn Health,
I will have access to mentors and experts that will not only directly facilitate my mastery of the necessary technical
skills, but I will also have opportunities to continue honing my clinical skills and gain specialized experience
during and after my research phase. Fulfilling my training and development plan will be a crucial step toward my

10761724,"ABSTRACT
For the first time, over 100,000 deaths were caused by drug overdose in a 12-month period (April 2020 - April
2021) in the United States. Synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl, accounted for over 60% of all overdose deaths
during this span (87% of opioid overdose deaths). Over the past decade, the number of overdose deaths
involving synthetic opioids has risen 20-fold, approaching 60,000 in 2020. The emergence of fentanyl analogs,
some of which are much more potent than fentanyl (e.g., carfentanil, reported to be ~100 times more potent than
fentanyl), pose serious risk to public health. Another dangerous characteristic of exposure to these drugs is that
they are predominantly taken unknowingly which, combined with their potency, increases the risk of overdose.
The opioid receptor antagonist naloxone is the only FDA-approved treatment for opioid overdose. While
naloxone has saved countless lives, its effectiveness is limited by its short duration of action and that its
antagonism is competitive – that is, that the effects of naloxone can be surmounted by taking more of an opioid
agonist. Clinical reports suggest that larger or more frequent doses of naloxone are required to reverse opioid
overdose involving carfentanil or other fentanyl analogs, and preclinical studies show reduced effectiveness of
opioid antagonists to antagonize the effects of carfentanil relative to other opioid agonists. The novel opioid
receptor antagonist methocinnamox (MCAM) binds non-competitively at the mu opioid receptor and has
extremely long-lasting effects. A recent study demonstrated that some effects of MCAM are mediated through
binding an allosteric site on the mu opioid receptor. This finding warrants further study and provides rationale for
evaluating the potential of using mixtures of antagonists to reverse opioid-induced ventilatory depression. The
proposed studies use whole-body plethysmography in rats to address current trends in opioid overdose death
and the need for development of new treatment options for opioid overdose, testing the hypotheses that the
effects of mixtures of opioid agonists will be greater than each drug when given alone, and that mixtures of the
opioid antagonists naloxone and MCAM will be more potent than naloxone alone at reversing the effects of opioid
agonists on ventilation. Aim 1 will determine the nature of the interaction between the effects of heroin, fentanyl,
and carfentanil on ventilation. Aim 2 will determine the nature of the interactions between naloxone, MCAM, and
diprenorphine for reversing the ventilatory depressive effects of heroin, fentanyl, and carfentanil, and begin to
assess the mechanism of this interaction. The proposed studies will determine the nature of interactions between
opioid agonists commonly involved in opioid overdose and evaluate whether mixtures of opioid antagonists might
be more effective alternatives to naloxone for reversing opioid overdose. Results from these studies will provide
valuable information related to recent trends in opioid overdose death and possible improvements in the
treatment of opioid overdose. The proposed training plan will develop my skills at designing, conducting, and
disseminating my independent research, paving the way to becoming a successful independent investigator."

Arenaviruses comprise a diverse family. Several species are associated with severe
arenaviral hemorrhagic fever (AVHF) in humans. Human infection with arenaviruses
typically occurs through contact with materials contaminated with the excretions of an
infected rodent although direct human- to-human transmission may occur in clinical settings.
AVHF resulting from infection with the Old World arenavirus Lassa is estimated to cause
over 300,000 annual infections in Western Africa, of which 15-20% of hospitalized patients
die while survivors often suffer permanent sequelae. The intravenous administration of the
nonspecific antiviral agent has been adopted ribavirin (off-label) for Lassa virus infections in
Western Africa. However, it has been shown to provide limited efficacy and a significant risk for
serious side effects including thrombocytopenia and anemia. Given the limited treatment
and prophylactic options, the mortality/morbidity rate, the potential for both zoonotic and
human-to-human transmission, geographical transplantation and bio-weaponization
six arenaviruses have been recognized as Category A pathogens. In order to provide a
potent and specific antiviral to treat Lassa and other arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers here we
propose the completion of IND-enabling studies and advanced nonclinical studies for an oral
preclinical candidate entry inhibitor with sub-nanomolar broad spectrum arenavirus activity and
demonstrable drug-like features that exhibits remarkable in vivo therapeutic efficacy."
10843930,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) remains the deadliest form of ovarian cancer, in part because
most patients develop recurrent disease that is resistant to standard treatment, including platinum. Poly(ADP-
ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors (PARPis) have recently been approved as an important therapy for
HGSOCs, especially for HGSOCs with defects in homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair due to
mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. However, over 70% HGSOCs that initially respond to PARPis later develop
resistant disease. Unfortunately, the underlying mechanisms of PARPi resistance are poorly understood. This
project is designed to understand acquired PARPi resistance mechanisms and associated therapeutic
vulnerabilities in HR-defective HGSOC. Our preliminary studies using HR-deficient HGSOC cell lines and
patient derived xenograft (PDX) models show that acquired PARPi resistance is associated with high levels of
nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (NMNAT1). Our results also show that NMNAT1
upregulation results in an increase in NAD+ levels, which restores HR and creates a unique metabolic
dependency in PARPi-resistant cells. These findings led to our central hypothesis that HR-deficient HGSOC
acquire PARPi resistance by upregulating NMNAT1 that induces NAD+ levels leading to HR restoration as well
as causing a metabolic dependency that may be therapeutically tractable. Guided by strong preliminary data,
we propose three specific aims to: 1) examine how NMNAT1 is upregulated in HGSOC cells; 2) determine how
NMNAT1 induces PARPi resistance; and 3) test whether NMNAT1-induced metabolic dependency in PARPi-
resistant tumors can be targeted in preclinical models of HGSOC. These studies will unveil a previously
unknown mechanism by which HGSOC cells become resistant to PARPis and may identify a potential new
therapeutic option for PARPi-resistant HGSOC. The proposed work comprises an essential step toward our
long-term goal of developing effective therapy for patients with HGSOC."
10772015,"Project Summary
The opioid epidemic currently affecting the United States has entered a new wave of mortality, with combined
use of opioid and psychomotor simulants as a major contributing factor to the number of overdose deaths.
Combined use of fentanyl and methamphetamine may be due to a number of factors, including greater
rewarding effects, decreased negative side effects, and/or feelings that combined use is somehow ‘safer’ than
use of fentanyl alone. For those reasons, there is a clear need to examine the differences in the behavioral and
neurobiological alterations that occur following chronic use of fentanyl, methamphetamine, and these two
substances in combination. My preliminary findings suggest that there is enhanced hypodopaminergia
following combined use of fentanyl and methamphetamine (COMBO) when compared to fentanyl use alone. I
have determined that 1) in both male and female rats, elicited DA release was decreased in COMBO animals
compared to fentanyl alone animals and; (2) male COMBO animals had greater response rates and responded
more on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the scarcely
studied combination of fentanyl and methamphetamine via a three-pronged approach examining behavioral
and neurobiological alterations to the DA system through self-administration, microdialysis and fast scan cyclic
voltammetry, and the use of the novel photosensor dLight during behavioral responding. Collectively, the
proposed aims will provide insight into the neurobiological and behavioral differences elicited by combined use
of fentanyl and methamphetamine, an under-studied topic that is highly relevant for the current state of the
opioid epidemic in the United States."
10794403,"Mental health conditions are common among pregnant and postpartum women as well as non-pregnant
women of reproductive age. While many patients require pharmacologic treatment, the safety of psychotropic
medications in pregnancy is an area with large evidence gaps. Historically, spontaneous reports, pregnancy
exposure registries, and case-control designs were the main approaches used to evaluate the safety of
psychotropic medications in pregnancy, all of which have well-known limitations. In recent years, the field has
gained much expertise with the conduct of cohort studies nested in large healthcare utilization data. Across all
these designs, studies tend to focus on a single or a few selected adverse pregnancy outcomes, and they are
performed at a single time point many years after the drug has entered the market and has been used by many
pregnant women. To avoid unnecessary exposure of mother and fetus to harmful medications or to avoid
women being unnecessarily deprived of treatments for psychiatric disorders when no harmful effects exist, a
new and systematic approach is needed to generate timely evidence on the safety of psychotropic medications
in pregnancy with respect to all relevant maternal and fetal outcomes.
We will develop and implement a TreeScan based approach to conduct active surveillance of antipsychotic
medication safety in pregnancy. TreeScan is a novel method for drug safety surveillance, which scans
hierarchical trees of specific outcomes as well as groups of clinically related outcomes for associations with the
treatment of interest, while accounting for multiple testing of correlated hypotheses. We will first develop
hierarchical trees for congenital malformations, maternal and other neonatal outcomes based on shared
underlying disease processes, and modify the TreeScan approach to accommodate the unique challenges of
drug safety evaluation in the context of pregnancy. Use of hierarchical trees increases power to detect clinically
related outcomes, which would not be feasible by evaluating individual diagnoses only. We will then implement
TreeScan to evaluate the risks of a broad range of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with
antipsychotic medications. Antipsychotics are the mainstay of treatment for women with schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder, but little is known regarding their safety profile in pregnancy, especially for the newer
antipsychotics. We will use nationwide cohorts of over 3.5 million publicly and privately insured pregnancies in
the US, nested in healthcare utilization databases that contain rich information on confounders. In the final aim,
we will extend the approach to conduct near real-time prospective, sequential surveillance of newly approved
antipsychotic and other psychotropic medications in order to detect potential safety signals as early as possible
after approval. By providing the necessary information for healthcare providers to make evidence-based
prescribing decisions and to counsel women about the use of specific antipsychotics during pregnancy, the
proposed studies will have an immediate public health impact within the field of perinatal psychiatry."
10795000,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Pregnancy represents a unique challenge for the maternal-fetal immune interface, requiring the balance
between immunosuppression, essential for the maintenance of semi-allogeneic fetus and pro-inflammatory
host defense to protect the mother and fetus from invading organisms. Adaptation to repeated inflammatory
stimuli may be critical in preventing rejection of the fetus by the exaggerated maternal inflammatory responses
to mild/moderate infections that are common during human pregnancy.
 Immune tolerance/adaptation is a well-described phenomenon in which cells exposed to repeated
pathogens become less responsive to subsequent exposures. This adaptation suppresses an overly
aggressive inflammatory response to repeated infections that can be detrimental to the tissues rather than
protective. Dampened immune response to repeated infections has been associated with protection against
tissue injury and mortality in several human diseases. However, to date, the role of immune tolerance to
repeated infections in the context of human pregnancy, and the exact mechanisms that contribute to the
establishment of such immune adaptation to prevent inflammation-induced pathologic pregnancies are not
explored. There is now extensive evidence that miRNAs play an important role in the maintenance of a healthy
pregnancy, with a wide range of miRNAs implicated in endometrial receptivity, implantation, gestational tissues
function, and labor. Our preliminary results indicate that repeated LPS (gram negative bacterial toxins) or LTA
(gram-positive bacterial toxins) exposures to human placenta attenuates exaggerated inflammatory responses
known to contribute to inflammation-associated pathologic pregnancies. Our data also point to the involvement
of a human- and placenta-specific miRNA called miRNA-519c-3p (miR-519c) in the development of placental
immune tolerance. Our overriding hypothesis is that repeated exposure of the placenta to pathogens induces a
tolerant phenotype mediated by the miR-519c to guard the maternal-fetal interface from the exaggerated
inflammation associated with pathologic pregnancies. We hypothesize that LPS/LTA induce placental
trophoblasts to secrete miR-519c packaged within placental extracellular vesicles for delivery to nearby or
distant cells. The miR-519c within the EVs will mediate down-regulation of exaggerated pro-inflammatory
responses associated with repeated bacterial toxin exposures.
 We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Investigate the role of miR-519c in mediating immune
adaptation in the human placenta after repeated infections and Aim 2: Investigate the molecular mechanisms
of placental miR-519c mediating immune adaptation. These studies will set the stage for future experiments to
test if decreased expression of miR-519c is linked to inflammation-associated pathologic pregnancies. This
unique human- and placenta-specific miR-519c can be an excellent biomarker candidate as well as a
therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases of pregnancy."

Our long term goal is to learn how an inherited single gene error produces a specific pattern of
epilepsy in the developing brain, to provide an exact description of relevant plasticity within
affected neural networks, and to reverse the seizure phenotype at the earliest possible stage.
Spike-wave (SW) absence seizures comprise a major category of inherited epilepsy in children,
and often herald cognitive deficits and more severe seizures. Over 20 mutant genes for this
phenotype are known, and their effects on channel behavior and routes of convergence on
excitability within thalamocortical pacemaking circuitry are now more clearly defined. The P/Q
calcium channel mouse mutant is a prototype for this analysis, and like other models, shows
elevated thalamic T-type calcium currents that are sufficient to generate absence epilepsy,
illuminating a shared downstream plasticity pathway triggered by functionally disparate
upstream SW genes. The mechanism underlying T-type current remodeling is not understood.
In the past project period we narrowed the critical pathogenic microcircuitry and found that
selective ablation of P/Q type calcium channels in Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons alone are
sufficient to elevate thalamic T currents and cause SW epilepsy, reducing the analysis from the
entire brain to a single thalamic afferent synapse, and showed that adult P/Q channel deletion
reproduces the childhood syndrome albeit through an alternative pattern of T current circuit
remodeling. Using newly created models, we will 1) analyze native and alternative thalamic
transcriptome changes to define the molecular basis for T current plasticity in thalamic
excitatory and inhibitory neurons and uncover novel epistatic genes participating in this switch,
2) test the thalamic current imbalance in a digenic model to simulate the combinatorial effects of
common human CAE variants in T currents, and 3) determine whether we can reverse the T

Myxomatous degeneration leads to mitral valve prolapse, which occurs in almost 3% of the general population
and 10% of the elderly, is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Additionally, early-onset of myxomatous
mitral valve degeneration is associated with both syndromic and non-syndromic diseases, supporting there is an
underlying genetic etiology. Despite the frequency of mitral valve diseases, the cellular, molecular, and genetic
etiologies underlying myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valves remain poorly understood. Presently, valve
reconstruction and replacement surgeries are the only therapies available for mitral valve diseases. Thus, in
order to develop novel non-invasive pharmacological therapies that can effectively prevent and ameliorate mitral
valve diseases, it is essential to understand conserved mechanisms the underlie the progression of valve
diseases in vertebrates. The specific aims of this proposal are to interrogate the mechanisms by which loss of
the Nr2f transcription factors can lead to the development of myxomatous valves in zebrafish and mice.
Numerous studies have indicated that mutations in Nr2f genes in humans are associated with a spectrum of
congenital heart defects, some of which are correlated with myxomatous valve degeneration. While requirements
for Nr2f factors are well-established in heart development, previous work has not implicated Nr2f transcription
factors in homeostasis of mature valves and myxomatous valve degeneration. Interestingly, the majority of
previous genes associated with myxomatous valve degeneration are involved in the regulation of extracellular
matrix, mechanotransduction, and cilia. Our preliminary analysis in adult zebrafish mutants called acorn worm
(aco), which are deficient for Nr2f1a, show they develop myxomatous atrioventricular valves with all the hallmarks
of myxomatous valves in mammals. Furthermore, we identify Nr2f proteins are expressed in previously
unrecognized populations of cells within the atrioventricular valves. In Aim 1, we will use tissue-specific rescue
and knockout approaches in zebrafish and mice to determine if valve endothelial cells require Nr2f to maintain
valve homeostasis and prevent myxomatous generation. In Aim 2, we will employ pharmacological and genetic
epistasis to decipher if RA and signals including Fibrillin 1, whose misexpression is associated with myxomatous
degeneration in humans, function downstream of Nr2f1a to promote myxomatous atrioventricular valve
degeneration. In Aim 3, we will use lineage tracing and ablation studies to determine if specific immune cells
contribute to the progression of myxomatous atrioventricular valves in aco mutants. Our use of these unique
mutants with complementary analysis in mice will dramatically improve our understanding of conserved
mechanisms that can lead to the progression of myxomatous valve degeneration in vertebrates. Ultimately, our
studies may provide the foundation for novel non-invasive therapies that can prevent and heal myxomatous
mitral valves in humans."

Covalent modifications of histones, such as acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation, are
essential for regulating chromatin structure and function and defective histone modifications have causal roles
in numerous developmental disorders and diseases. Our long-term goal is to use fission yeast heterochromatin
assembly as an experimental model to study how diverse histone modification activities are coordinated to
initiate different gene expression states and how these states are epigenetically inherited. Heterochromatin
preferentially assembles at repetitive DNA elements, and it is essential for regulating gene expression and
maintaining genome integrity. The formation of heterochromatin is critically dependent on the methylation of H3
lysine 9 (H3K9me). Interestingly, the activities of H3K9 methyltransferases are stimulated by the ubiquitylation
of H3 lysine 14 (H3K14ub), although the mechanism is poorly understood. We will examine how H3K14ub
stimulates H3K9 methyltransferases and how H3K14ub is regulated in vivo to aid heterochromatin assembly.
Heterochromatin is also a great model to study chromatin-based mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance. An
important unresolved question is how parental histones carrying modifications are deposited onto newly
synthesized DNA during the S phase of the cell cycle to direct the duplication of these modifications on
daughter chromatids. We developed eSPAN (enrichment of Sequencing Protein-Associated Nascent DNA) in
fission yeast, which allows us to measure the segregation of parental histones on daughter DNA strands. We
will integrate this new genomic tool and traditional genetic approaches to examine mechanisms that regulate
the segregation of parental histones and how they contribute to epigenetic inheritance. Together, these studies
will address fundamental questions about how histone modifications are regulated and inherited, and how their
dysregulation contributes to human diseases."

Persons with HIV (PWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART) suffer from higher rates of cardiometabolic diseases
compared with the general population, which contributes to poor health outcomes. Adipose tissue is a critical
regulator of systemic metabolic processes, and changes in adipose tissue immune cell populations that
modulate adipose tissue function, may in part, contribute to the risk of metabolic disease in PWH. Prior studies
have shown striking changes in adipose tissue CD4+ and CD8+ T cell profile in PWH. Yet the current
understanding of the role of adipose tissue immune cells in metabolic disease is limited by few studies to date
evaluating PWH on contemporary ART, limited studies using single cell technologies to characterize specific
cell populations, and finally limited understanding of the relationship of adipose tissue T cell populations with
adipose tissue viral reservoir. Defining the mechanisms through which adipose tissue innate and adaptive
immune cells contribute to metabolic diseases is critical for identifying preventative and therapeutic strategies
that reduce morbidity and mortality in PWH. I leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to define
adipose tissue compositional and transcriptional changes that occur with glucose intolerance in PWH using
cross-sectional data, and compared these changes to diabetic HIV-negative adipose tissue. I found that higher
proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells and lipid-associated macrophages (LAMs) was
associated with glucose intolerance in PWH and higher CD4+ and CD8+ TEM proportion were associated with
greater fibroblastic cells in PWH only. Our overall hypothesis is that proinflammatory TEM cells expressing
interferon-g and tumor necrosis factor a are increased in PWH on ART, infiltrate adipose tissue and promote
macrophage polarization, are associated with the adipose tissue viral reservoir, and contribute to the
development of metabolic disease. Building upon my computational analysis skills, my career development
plan will enhance my skills and knowledge in: 1) T cell immunology and analyses; 2) conducting clinical and
translational research; and 3) application of multi-omic analysis to address critical research gaps. In Aim 1, I
will define the cell-type specific transcriptional pattern and adipose tissue composition that are associated with
progressive insulin resistance in PWH on long-term ART. In Aim 2, I will investigate the adipose tissue T cell
transcriptional and compositional pattern pre-treatment and at one year of integrase strand transferase
inhibitor-based regimen in those who develop progressive insulin resistance compared with those who do not.
In Aim 3, I will determine the relationship between anti-viral T cells, the adipose tissue viral reservoir, and
adipose tissue inflammation. Completion of these aims will greatly increase the understanding of specific
immune cells contributing to inflammation and the potential factors that drive inflammation. Additionally, the
training and data from the K23 award will allow me to transition to research independence in the HIV co-
morbidities field with a concentration on immune cell response."
10795882,"The need for veterinarians trained as biomedical scientists is well-documented. We request here continued
funding to support four post-DVM fellows per year for three years of research training. Optimal research
training exists when qualified and motivated trainees work in the laboratories of experienced, productive and
well-funded scientist mentors. Such mentors impart the knowledge, work habits, communicative skills and
research skills enabling trainees to succeed as independent scientists and contributors to multidisciplinary
research teams. These scientists will be skilled both in the use of animal models and the application of cellular,
immunologic, molecular, genomic or translational approaches to address questions of human health
significance. Promising trainees identified through a summer fellowship program and multiple other strategies
are encouraged to apply to this program. Diversity is sought through a multi-level outreach program. Trainees
typically enroll in the Graduate School of Wake Forest University and pursue a PhD degree in one of the 8
biomedical tracks offered at Wake Forest School of Medicine. Trainees will choose a Mentor from among a
group of well-funded and experienced scientists and educators and will be assigned an Associate Mentor with
expertise relevant to the trainee’s research project. Associate Mentors are faculty members without
independent research funding and/or with limited training experience, but with critical clinical or core laboratory
expertise. This co-mentoring approach will allow Associate Mentors to gain training experience in a team
setting. There are 21 Mentors with independent research programs and funding, and an additional 9 Associate
Mentors. Of the training faculty, 9 are DVMs (including 5 DVM/PhD and 2 DVM/MS researchers), 19 are PhDs,
and 4 are MDs (including 2 MD/PhDs). In addition to mentored research and required coursework, all trainees
will attend weekly research seminars and journal clubs. Training in the responsible conduct of research is
integral and includes mentoring, didactic sessions, and group discussion. Structured evaluations of both the
trainees and the program are conducted annually. There are 6 areas of research emphasis, based on interest
in training and networks of collaboration among productive, funded investigative groups: 1) cardiovascular
disease/diabetes, 2) cancer biology, 3) women’s health 4) microbiology and immunology, 5) radiation injury,
and 6) regenerative medicine. Unique features of the research environment include access to national primate
resources; a world-class program in tissue engineering at The Wake Forest Institute of Regenerative Medicine;
the Wake Forest Translational Science Institute; and substantial ongoing growth in imaging, irradiation, and
digital spatial profiling capabilities. In the past 15 years, 16 fellows have completed research training through
this program, and 13 remain in academic, industry or government biomedical research. Ten sought and were
awarded PhDs. Three fellows will defend PhDs in 2023. Ninety-six scientific publications have resulted from
T32-supported projects in the past 10 years."

The nervous system is an electrical system, and neurons are the archetypal electrically active cell, but ion
transport is fundamental to the regulation of every cell in the body, whether excitable or not, and almost 20%
of approved drugs actually work on ion channels. Multiple neurological diseases, including movement
disorders, migraine, and epilepsy, can clearly be caused directly by inherited mutations of specific ion
channels and transporters, but defective ion transport is also associated with every big disease, from cancers
to heart disease to Alzheimer's disease. We aim to generate a cohort of researchers with the appropriate in-
depth understanding of membrane biology, in combination with state-of-the-art technical skills, to carry out
basic and translational research in excitability. The intended result is researchers with the capability to
transform excitability research – and hence therapies – by harnessing burgeoning advances in (i) membrane
protein structure determination, (ii) measurement of excitability, by electrophysiology and imaging, from
molecular to tissue levels, (iii) modeling, both biological and computational and (iv) modulation of excitability,
both pharmacologically and physically. The program will support later stage pre-doctoral and post-doctoral
trainees in dual-mentored research, with a primary mentor from one of the above fundamental focus areas,
and a second mentor who could be from an applied focus area – including methods development or
organismal and clinical studies. In addition to intensive research experiences, trainees will participate in a
didactic course, geared towards in-depth research understanding, as well as activities devoted to training in
grant writing, presentations, and career development. The program faculty mentors, chosen with regard to
breadth and diversity of background and career stage, all with strong track records of funding and
commitment to trainee development, the interdisciplinary nature of training opportunities, and institutional
commitments combine to foster a unique environment suited to the goal of this TriMED program. The
program will identify individuals with appropriate backgrounds, who are committed to a career in excitability
research, and provide them with mentored pre- and post-doctoral research experiences that will establish a
foundation for future careers capable of bringing new insights and tools to bear in neuroscience and disorders
of excitability."
10853046,"ABSTRACT
 Predicting the impact of genomic variation requires quantitative modeling to deconstruct the interplay
between multiple individual variants and to determine their combined effects on gene regulatory networks
(GRNs) that control cell state and cell function. We focus on the GRNs that control early human development
as a paradigm. Arguably the most important lineage decision during mammalian development is the decision of
epiblast cells to exit the pluripotent state (a state when the cells have the potential to give rise to all somatic
cells and germ cells), and differentiate into one of the three primary germ layers, the endoderm, mesoderm,
and ectoderm. This pluripotent state and the trilineage differentiation can be captured using cultured human
embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Much attention has focused on the GRNs underlying the maintenance of the
self-renewing pluripotent state, but the GRNs governing hESC trilineage differentiation remain largely
unexplored. We previously conducted genome-scale CRISPR/Cas screens to discover protein-coding genes
that regulate the transition of hESCs to definitive endoderm. Based on the genomic and genetic data and
machine learning (gkm-SVM sequence analysis), we expanded our initial simple two transcription factor (TF)
model to a multiple TF cooperative model. Here we propose an integrative approach examining the hESC
transition to definitive endoderm, mesoderm and neuroectoderm germ layer identities to improve the
generalizability of GRN models. We will perform quantitative genomic and proteomic measurements with high
temporal and single-cell resolution. These quantitative measurements will be combined with perturbation of key
GRN elements, core TFs and their target enhancers, to inform the generation of dynamic GRN models. To
further improve the precision of our new GRN models, we will map cell trajectories during state transitions
through lineage tracing combined with scRNA-seq. Beyond hESC guided differentiation, the physiological
relevance of enhancers will be further interrogated in human and mouse organoids (gastruloids) and mouse
embryos. We will then apply innovative new computational and algorithmic methods to our multimodal
experimental data to generate GRN models, aiming to learn generalizable principles underlying the
contribution of genomic variants to cellular and ultimately organismal phenotypes. Developing GRN models for
the exit of pluripotency and the acquisition of germ layer identities involves dynamic modeling of the cell state
transition, which will not only inform our understanding of early human development, but can also serve as the
basis for construction of generalizable GRN models for biological transitions during embryonic development,
adult tissue homeostasis and regeneration as well as inappropriate cell fate transitions that occur in
pathological conditions such as cancer."
10808885,"Abstract
 A fundamental question in biology is how individual cells within a multicellular organism
recognize other cells as self to cooperatively function in tissues, organs and as whole individuals.
To address this complex question, we study a relatively simple and experimentally trackable
model organism, Myxococcus xanthus. Although a bacterium, M. xanthus exhibits many traits
found in tissues and more complex multicellular species. One trait is multicellular development in
response to starvation. Another trait, we discovered, is the ability of cells to distinguish between
self and nonself for the exchange of cellular proteins and lipids. Recognition is mediated by a
polymorphic cell surface receptor called TraA and its partner TraB. Only cells that bear identical
or nearly identical TraA receptors engage by homotypic interactions. Social outcomes from this
process, called outer membrane exchange (OME), vary depending on the properties of the
interacting cells. In some cases, OME leads to cooperative interactions whereby healthy donors
repair damaged cells by replenishing their cell components. In other cases, OME leads to
antagonism when partnering cells are not clonal. Discrimination occurs by polymorphic toxin
transfer to recipient cells that lack cognate immunity.
 Our future goals are multifaceted with respect to understanding OME and, more broadly, how
cells recognize self and transition toward multicellularity. Over the next five years we will critically
examine how OME leads to cooperativity. One area of investigation is how TraA/B directs
emergent behaviors in populations that include synchronized and coordinated movements. This
will be explored by monitoring global gene expression and how TraA/B interacts with a signal
transduction pathway that controls motility. Cell synchronization is being studied with a biosensor
the monitors’ calcium fluxes in cells. Other approaches will probe how M. xanthus responds and
adapts to environmental stresses, whereby those adaptations are transferred to naïve populations
by OME. A second area of research addresses how myxobacteria rapidly diverge into different
social groups in natural environments. Our preliminary findings indicate that horizontal gene
transfer by non-lytic transducing particles mediate population divergence by carrying polymorphic
genes involved in social discrimination. A third focus area will elucidate the mechanism of OME
thought to involve outer membrane fusion. Finally, we will explore new mechanisms of self-
recognition and its role in multicellular life."
10816581,"This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused on the study of antigen
specific CD4 T cells in tuberculosis (TB), with the long-term goals to reveal new information about immune
protection in TB and inform the development of an effective new vaccine for this disease. The candidate is
currently an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Minnesota (UMN) in the Division of Infectious
Diseases. The outlined proposal builds on the candidate’s previous experience by adding new domains of
expertise in advanced T cell immunology, international collaborative patient-oriented research and human
immunology, and single cell transcriptomics. The training objectives are represented by the mentorship team of
Marc Jenkins and David Boulware, and other key collaborators at UMN. The proposed experimental and
didactic work will position the candidate with a unique set of cross-disciplinary skills that will enable his
transition to independence as a physician scientist focused on the immunology of TB.
 A better understanding of the factors that govern CD4 T cell function in TB could help guide the
development of vaccine candidates more likely to elicit protective immunity against TB disease. It is becoming
clearer that IFN-g secretion is only one protective function of CD4 T cells in TB. The other key effector
mechanisms of CD4 T cells in TB are still being defined, and the determinants of these immune functions
remain to be fully characterized. The overall scientific objectives of this particular project are to characterize
CD4 T cell functions at the site of infection and to define how antigen availability and T cell receptor (TCR)-
epitope affinity govern these functions. The premise of this proposal is that effector activity of CD4 T cells at
the site of TB infection is determined by characteristics of the Mtb antigen targeted. The central hypotheses are
1) that CD4 T cells with lower affinity TCRs, targeting Mtb antigens with moderate abundance, have more
diverse and superior functions, and 2) that antigen specific CD4 T cells at the site of infection perform key
effector functions outside the Th1 paradigm. To test these hypotheses, the following aims are proposed: Aim
1: Determine how antigen-intrinsic factors govern CD4 T cell function in TB, and Aim 2: Characterize CD4 T
cell function and diversity at the site of human TB infection. To accomplish these aims, innovative approaches
are proposed including: modulation of Mtb gene expression in vivo, identification of lower affinity TCRs, and
unbiased identification of CD4 T cells that have recently received TCR stimulation in vivo. By pairing these
approaches in the mouse model with studies of human T cells from the cerebrospinal fluid of individuals with
HIV-associated TB meningitis, using single cell transcriptomic profiling, these studies will characterize how Mtb
antigen-intrinsic factors elicit CD4 T cell populations of varying functional capacity and diversity. This K08
project will guide new TB vaccine development and promote the candidate’s transition to independence."
10808869,"Project Summary: Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy (ACM) is the most prevalent form of ethanol-induced heart
damage. Alcohol dose-dependently induces ACM, characterized by progressive reduction in myocardial
contractility and ventricular dilatation, culminating in heart failure. At the cellular level, chronic alcohol
consumption results in cardiomyocyte death, cardiac inflammation, and cardiac fibrosis. There are currently no
FDA-approved therapies for ACM. The long-term goal of this project is to advance emodin, a small molecule
natural compound with anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and anti-fibrotic activities, for ACM prevention or
treatment. We have generated a robust body of background data in the basic science and early discovery
phase that supports emodin as a novel therapy for ACM including: 1) TGFβ signaling is the primary underlying
mechanism responsible for alcohol-induced cardiac fibrosis, a key component of ACM pathogenesis, 2)
Emodin is an effective inhibitor of TGFβ canonical and non-canonical signaling in multiple cell types, 3) The
pharmacokinetics (PK) and excellent safety of emodin have been examined in murine models, and 4) At non-
toxic oral doses, emodin effectively ameliorates cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction associated with doxorubicin, a
pathology similar to ACM. Furthermore, our preliminary data illustrates that emodin attenuates alcohol-induced
loss of cardiomyocyte viability and activation of cardiac fibroblasts. We propose to further test the central
hypothesis that emodin can be developed as a safe and effective preventive and/or therapeutic agent for ACM.
In this Phase 1 STTR application, we propose to examine the PK, safety, and efficacy of emodin in chronic
alcohol consumption rodent models and perform a PK and toxicity study in pigs in the following three specific
aims. SA1. To test if alcohol consumption influences emodin metabolism and evaluate the safety and efficacy
of emodin in ameliorating ACM in mouse models. SA2. To examine the PK, safety, and efficacy of emodin in
reducing cardiac fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction in alcohol-fed rats in both prevention and treatment settings.
SA3.To perform a PK and safety study of emodin in pigs and find a safe dose range that may achieve effective
blood emodin concentrations. By the end of the funding period of this STTR Phase 1 application, we will
possibly move emodin towards the next phase of drug development: IND-enabling preclinical study. Milestones
for a Go/no-go decision include: 1) if emodin does not exaggerate alcohol-induced toxicities in mice and rats,
particularly liver toxicity; 2) if there is significant efficacy of emodin in ameliorating ACM in mice and rats; and
3) if an appropriate safe dose is identified in pigs that can be extrapolated to humans. If answers to the above
three questions are positive, the decision will be made to further the development process of emodin, and a
Phase II application will be submitted to perform an IND-enabling preclinical study, including 1) safety and
efficacy studies in pig ACM models in a GLP setting, and 2) formulation and cGMP manufacturing of emodin
capsule for human use."

Chemeleon, Inc. is a NYC-based startup that is developing a novel colorimetric biosensor that rapidly diagnoses
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks at the Point-of-Care (POC), such as by doctors to diagnose Traumatic Brain
Injury (TBI) patients in the Emergency Department (ED), or the Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) in the
ambulance, or during intraoperative and post-operative care for spinal and otolaryngological surgeries. CSF
leaks occur when the fluid that cushions the brain and spine escapes through ruptures in the surrounding
membranes. These leaks are largely caused by TBIs but are also a risk during spinal surgeries, otolaryngological
surgeries, lumbar punctures and epidurals and they can also be spontaneous. Distinguishing CSF leaks from
other bodily fluids is a well-known problem for ED doctors, EMTs and surgeons as the leaks often present as
unilateral rhinorrhea or otorrhea, a clear watery discharge from the nose or ear, or as a mixture with blood and
other fluids during spinal surgery. Currently there are no POC diagnostics for CSF leaks and existing methods
require patient samples to be sent to third-party laboratories for results that can take 4-7 days. Treatment delays
or misdiagnoses significantly increase the risk for life-threatening meningitis, infections and stroke. Patients with
CSF rhinorrhea that develop meningitis have also have much higher morbidity rates. Additionally, the weeklong
stay not only causes significant distress and discomfort for the patient, but also leads to radically higher
healthcare costs. In this Direct-to-Phase II proposal, Chemeleon aims to advance CSF leak diagnosis by
developing a novel, inexpensive biosensor that requires no additional equipment or personnel training that can
provide results in minutes, enabling medical professionals to make time-sensitive decisions. Chemeleon has
already successfully developed a prototype Binding-Induced Nanostructured Dynamic Surface (BINDS) Assay
that binds the CSF protein biomarker, beta-2-transferrin (b2TR). This BINDS platform technology integrates
nanophotonic reporter surfaces with b2TR-specific aptamer receptors, where binding of b2TR to the sensor
surface alters the surface energy producing a vibrant color change that is visible to the naked eye. Proof-of-
concept experiments revealed that Chemeleon’s BINDS CSF assay could detect 1 µg/ml of b2TR in 10 minutes,
which is higher than the 4-5 µg/ml found in CSF. For Direct-to-Phase II studies, the CSF sensor will be further
developed to achieve the high specificity, high sensitivity and low readout time required for use in clinical and
field settings. Chemeleon will focus on (1) optimizing sensor performance to rapidly distinguish CSF from nasal
fluid and blood samples, (2) finalizing manufacturing processes for efficient scale-up, and (3) designing and
testing a commercial in vitro diagnostic prototype. Chemeleon’s CSF sensor will provide advancements in
decision-making for head trauma, spinal and otolaryngological surgical cases and present a modular platform
for the development of other healthcare diagnostics."

Emerging viral infections remain a global threat to human health. Bunyaviruses are the largest order of RNA
viruses that includes many clinically relevant human pathogens such as Lassa, Rift Valley Fever and various
hantaviruses which cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF). SFTSV, or Severe fever with thrombocytopenia
syndrome virus, is an emerging tick-borne bunyavirus that has caused outbreaks in Eastern Asia (China, Japan,
Korea, Vietnam) with up to a 30% case fatality rate. The host tick vector has now been discovered over a large
geographical setting and SFTSV has been found in numerous wild and domestic animal species highlighting a
risk for zoonotic spillover into humans. Though humans are usually dead-end hosts, human to human
transmission has been documented through blood and mucosal secretions. Furthermore, SFTSV has a
segmented genome which increases ability to reassort genes and mutate. Due to these features, in its 2017
“Research and Development Blueprint” the WHO identified SFTSV as one of 11 pathogens likely to cause a
sever outbreak in the future. As we have learned, from experience with recent zoonotic outbreaks, preparedness
is of the utmost importance. We are proposing to continue development of a recombinant vesicular stomatitis
virus (rVSV)-based vaccine for SFTSV. rVSV is an approved vaccination platform that is immunogenically potent
and proven tolerable. Preliminary work from our group has demonstrated that rVSV-SFTSV can elicit protection
in mice, is tolerable in immunocompromised animals and upon CNS injection, and can generate cross protecting
responses to a related bunyavirus. Furthermore, we observe elevated SFTSV-specific T cell and antibody
responses against both SFTSV spike proteins, Gn and Gc. In this Phase I, we propose to improve the design of
our vector which will increase viral titers to facilitate vaccine manufacturing and increase immunogenicity in
animals. In aim 1, we will focus on reverse engineering mutations into rVSV that will improve SFTSV Gn/Gc
incorporation into particles thereby improving virus replication and yield in vitro. We will characterize these 2nd
generation (Gen2) vaccines using molecular and cell-based assays scoring for viral replication, GnGc expression
in infected cells and incorporation of GnGc in VSV virions. In aim 2, we will assess the ability of our Gen2 vaccine
to protect animals in lethal SFTSV challenge studies. We hypothesize that increased GnGc expression and
replication of the Gen2 vectors will lead to improved immune responses in vaccinated animals compared to the
Gen1 vector. We will assess immune correlates of protection such enhanced neutralizing and cross protective
antibodies as well as robust T cell responses compared to Gen1 rVSV-SFTSV vaccinated animals. If successful,
our Phase I would set the foundation for a Phase II to advance manufacturing and stringently study protective
capacity of our vaccine in more advanced animal models."

 The goal of this research is to study the influence of age on the delivery processes required for lipid
nanoparticle-mediated mRNA vaccination, with a long-term goal of improving vaccination outcomes in the
elderly. In the next thirty years, our elderly population will double, exceeding 1.6 billion people worldwide.
Unfortunately, a declining immune system makes elderly people susceptible to an array of deadly infectious
diseases, placing additional burdens on global healthcare, particularly during epidemics and pandemics such
as Ebola and SARS-CoV-2. There is a real need for effective prophylactics that protect vulnerable populations.
Messenger RNA (mRNA) has emerged as a revolutionary platform that has catalyzed the fastest development
of vaccines in history and bolstered the fight against SARS-CoV-2. However, early data suggest that these
vaccines elicit an age-dependent immune response. The diminished antibody response of these vaccines in
the elderly can substantially curtail their duration of protection. There is an urgent need to understand mRNA
delivery as a function of age and develop potent and safe vaccines that can protect people across all age
groups. While other researchers are examining age-related immune system impairment, this research is
unique because it will determine age-related effects on the lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA delivery
process. This will enable the decoupling of impaired delivery and diminished immune responses on mRNA
vaccination in the elderly. I am well-poised to conduct this research, given my preliminary data and the
expertise of the Whitehead and Weissman labs with LNP delivery, immunology, and vaccinology.
 Although measuring post-vaccination infection rates and antibody titers as a function of age is
important, these endpoints do not capture the effect of age on critical intermediate steps during mRNA
vaccination. I hypothesize that differences in delivery contribute to reductions in mRNA-induced immunity. To
test this hypothesis, I will determine to what extent age affects lipid nanoparticle mRNA delivery endpoints (Aim
1) and immune responses (Aim 2), allowing the two to be decoupled. In Aim 1, I will determine the efficacy,
biodistribution, targeted cell population, immunogenicity, and toxicity of five top-performing lipid nanoparticles
following intramuscular injection in young and old mice of both sexes. In Aim 2, I will elucidate the impact of
age on the immune response of mRNA-LNPs. From Aim 2.1, we will select a top-performing LNP to investigate
further in a vaccine kinetics study (Aim 2.2). Aims 1 and 2 combined will reveal LNP structures that confer the
most robust immune response in young and old mice and aid the development of more efficacious mRNA
vaccines for the elderly.
This work is innovative because we will study how age impacts the process of nanoparticle delivery, which has
not been conducted comprehensively for mRNA-LNPs. In the long term, our discoveries will have clinical
significance because they will help tailor the design of LNP delivery systems for the elderly."
10782464,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The synthetic lethal interaction of BRCA deficiency with PARPi is being exploited therapeutically in diverse
clinical contexts, including ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers). However, PARPi resistance has emerged
as a vexing clinical problem for the treatment of BRCA1/2-deficient ovarian cancer carcinomas. Analyses of
PARPi resistance in BRCA1-mutant tumors across independent studies suggest that loss of genes involved in
either promoting NHEJ or suppressing HR leads to the partial restoration of HR in the absence of BRCA1 activity.
53BP1 emerged as the master regulator that brings multiple complexes to the DSB. Loss of any of these factors
causes PARPi resistance in BRCA1 mutant cells. Therefore, further understanding of factors that regulate the
processing of DNA ends that are crucial for pathway choice have tremendous relevance in cancer biology.
 Our lab has previously identified that in ovarian cancer cells, loss of DYNLL1, a factor that is constitutively
bound to 53BP1, also results in enhanced HR and PARPi resistance. We found that DYNLL1pS88 directly binds
to and inhibits MRE11, thereby blocking the initiation of DNA end resection. However, how the interaction of
DYNLL1 with MRE11 impairs its nuclease activity or its recruitment to foci remains unexplored. Furthermore,
how this interaction is regulated in the context of the DNA damage response, for example, which
kinase/phosphatase(s) regulates the phosphorylation of S88 residue of DYNLL1 to modulate its interaction with
MRE11 needs to be investigated.
 Our overall objectives in this application are to identify the molecular mechanism(s) regulating repair
pathway choice by further understanding how end resection proteins are regulated. Our central hypothesis is
that cell cycle-specific regulation of DYNLL1 promotes BRCA1/BARD1 mediated ubiquitination of MRE11,
thereby facilitating end resection at DSBs in S phase.
 We aim to understand the mechanism by which DYNLL1 mediates end resection and HR. We will first
investigate the dynamics between BRCA1 and DNA-PKcs and how it regulates the DYNLL1 and MRE11 activity
in the context of the cell cycle. Investigating the dynamics of these end resecting factors and their regulation in
DSB repair bear significant clinical relevance in combating PARPi resistance in BRCA1-mutant tumors.
Therefore, we propose to determine whether alterations in mechanisms involved in attenuated DNA end
resection may drive development of PARPi resistance in the high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) using
patient derived xenografts (PDXs) and primary tumors. We expect that these studies will further our
understanding of how end resection machinery is regulated to ensure that the appropriate repair pathway is
activated. Further understanding of these end resection factors and how they are dysregulated in cancer may
lead us to a relevant therapeutic target to combat PARPi resistant cancers."

Human variants in the cytoskeleton-associated protein ankyrin-B (AnkB) have been identified as risk factors for
metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes and obesity. Mice harboring these variants exhibit AnkB deficiency
in metabolic tissues including white (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), and develop age and diet-dependent
adiposity, insulin resistance, and glucose mishandling. Simultaneous AnkB deficiency in WAT and BAT also lead
to lipid accumulation in BAT (BAT “whitening”) and to decreases in energy expenditure and oxygen consumption.
These findings suggest that AnkB may function as an important regulator of lipid metabolism and systemic
metabolic regulation through its unexplored roles in BAT. The overarching goal of this study is to elucidate the
cell-autonomous roles of AnkB in BAT. We hypothesize that AnkB regulates lipogenesis in BAT and is required
for maintaining the energetic and glucose-handling capacity of BAT in response to metabolic stressors. To
answer these questions, we proposed to determine the molecular mechanism of association with AnkB
modulation of glucose handling and lipid metabolism in brown adipocytes (aim 1). Additionally, we will define
how AnkB deficiency in BAT regulates energy balance and systemic metabolic homeostasis in response to the
metabolic stressors, such as aging and high-fat diet (aim 2). Completion of the proposed studies will provide
functional insights into AnkB’s contribution to BAT physiology and metabolic homeostasis. The proposed work
will also shed light into the pathophysiological mechanism through which human AnkB variants contribute to
metabolic diseases."

Embryonic development involves the formation of functional organs comprised of many
different cell types, which often originate from different locations. Thus cell migration and
differentiation must be tightly coordinated, but are typically studied as independent
processes. Here we use a combination of gene expression profiling in single cells,
zebrafish genetics and computational models to test the hypothesis that migration and
differentiation are coordinated. This coordination requires specific regulators of cell
adhesion dynamics and cell-cell signaling. We focus on neural crest cells, a transient
embryonic population that migrates throughout the body to give rise to a huge range of
different fates. One barrier to studying this problem has been the limited number of tools
available to detect transitional states in individual cells as they differentiate and tie this to
their migratory behaviors in a precise and quantitative manner. Here we develop new
approaches for profiling gene expression in single cells from known locations and
tracking their movements in vivo. We will analyze how genes required for cell adhesion
and cell-cell signaling influence these processes, and use computational models to
predict key features of neural crest cell responses. We expect that such a
multidisciplinary approach will reveal insights into the mechanisms that integrate cell
migration and fate."

Modifications to cytosine bases within DNA play an important epigenetic role in shaping cellular identity and fate.
In mammalian genomes, the most abundant of these modifications is 5-methylcytosine (5mC), which has been
linked with gene silencing. A landmark moment in the field came from the discovery of TET enzymes, which
iteratively oxidize 5mC to yield 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and more highly oxidized 5mC bases. In
contrast with 5mC, 5hmC has been associated with gene activation, highlighting the importance of resolving
different DNA modification states. Given their biological significance, localizing modified bases within genomes
has been a major focus for the field. Epigenetic sequencing approaches can elucidate biological roles for DNA
modifications and can identify aberrant modifications that contribute to disease. The traditional method for
pinpointing cytosine modifications involves reacting sample DNA with bisulfite to selectively deaminate
unmodified cytosines, while preserving 5mC and 5hmC. While foundational, bisulfite can fragment DNA, raising
challenges with input DNA requirements, and the method confounds 5mC and 5hmC. Newly established
enzymatic methods are non-destructive, but still confound multiple bases and require excessive purification steps
that result in loss of DNA. This study aims to develop an enzymatic method for epigenetic sequencing of
solid-phase immobilized DNA, enabling quantitative capture of input DNA and resolution of modification
states, thus allowing for insightful sequencing to be conducted on limiting samples. Aim 1 proposes the
development, benchmarking, and application of the method to study how TET1 reshapes the epigenome in
primordial germ cells, a sample where analysis is limited by low sample quantities. After initially establishing a
solid-phase enzymatic method for epigenetic sequencing, this study will subsequently leverage solid-phase
enzymatic principles and multiplex them with chemical conversion to develop a method for resolving C,
5mC, and 5hmC in the same DNA molecule. Aim 2 proposes the development of an unprecedented method
capable of both locating and identifying epigenetic modifications in cis. Following method development and
validation, this method will be applied to study the Foxp3 locus where 5mC/5hmC modification dynamics are
known to play deterministic roles in regulatory T cell identity, but current methods cannot to parse cis modification
relationships. Overall, the two novel methods developed in this proposal will be applied with a focus on biological
insights and position the field for future applications aimed at resolving epigenetic abnormalities that can be a
hallmark of disease states. This training plan will prepare the PI for an independent research career investigating
epigenetic drivers of disease and will take place at the highly interdisciplinary University of Pennsylvania."

Type II diabetes takes a large toll on both individuals and society through morbidity and financial burden.
Patients with diabetes are at risk of developing diabetic foot ulcers that are nonhealing and can lead to
infections and amputations. The pathophysiology that underlies this impaired wound healing can be due to
damage to blood vessels, neurons, and immune function, all of which contribute to delayed wound healing.
Normally, skin requires nutrients like nonessential amino acids for building material and energy to undergo
repair and heal wounds. My preliminary metabolomics data in different wound regions in control and db/db
mice indicate that four nonessential amino acids, including serine and glycine, are particularly depleted in
diabetic wounds, suggesting their important biological roles in wound healing. Previous studies of diabetic mice
and humans have also found a reduction of serine and glycine within wounds and systemic blood. However, it
remains unknown why they are depleted, whether they are required for wound healing, and how they are used
for healing. Thus, identification of the cause of their reduction and usage by different cell populations during
wound healing in diabetic models will facilitate the future development of new therapeutics. To this end, I will 1)
define the distribution and fates of the four nonessential amino acids in different wound regions in healthy and
diabetic mice; and 2) determine whether serine and glycine supplementation can promote wound healing. My
proposed study will utilize a broad spectrum of innovative tools including in vivo stable isotope tracing coupled
with high-resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, microscopy, and cell sorting. This study will
expand our understanding of how efficient nutrient utilization facilitates wound healing in normal and diabetic
wounds. The findings from this study will also generate important implications regarding potential targets for
future pharmacological or genetic knockout experiments in the effort toward developing novel therapies for
improving diabetic wound healing."

Behavioral states such as sleep and wake profoundly affect the patterns of activity and neuromodulatory tone
within neocortical circuits, but the function of these state changes on learning and experience-dependent
plasticity remain controversial. It has been postulated that wake is when Hebbian mechanisms are engaged,
while sleep serves to homeostatically “renormalize” synaptic strengths/firing rates that were perturbed by
experience-dependent changes in the waking state. We study the homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that
stabilize firing rates and circuit function within primary visual cortex (V1), and can track this process in freely
behaving rodents. Perturbing firing through monocular visual deprivation (MD) initially suppresses firing (1-
2d MD), but firing rates then rebound to control levels over a 2 d period despite continued MD. Further, we can
perturb firing in the other direction using an MD followed by eye re-opening (ER) paradigm, and observed that
firing rates are potentiated by ER and again slowly return to baseline values. This ‘firing rate homeostasis’ is
accomplished in part through synaptic scaling up or down of excitatory synapses onto pyramidal neurons
within V1. We can follow this process in freely behaving animals cycling between natural bouts of sleep and
wake, to directly determine when the homeostatic restoration of firing occurs. In the last funding period we
made the surprising discovery that upward and downward firing rate homeostasis are oppositely regulated by
sleep and wake states: upward occurs gradually during each bout of active wake and is suppressed by sleep,
while downward is enabled by sleep and suppressed by wake. Our work reveals that sleep and wake states are
critically important for gating homeostatic plasticity, and act to segregate upward and downward homeostatic
processes into distinct behavioral states. How this is accomplished mechanistically is entirely unknown, as is
the function this segregation might serve. Here we propose to determine the features of waking/sleeping states
that enable/suppress firing rate homeostasis, and to test whether the underlying synaptic plasticity
mechanisms are themselves directly gated by sleep and wake. Finally, to gain insight into the
behavioral/functional consequences of this gating, we propose to test how sleep and wake orchestrate Hebbian
and homeostatic plasticity within V1 during a vision-dependent learning task. These experiments promise to
illuminate fundamental features of visual cortical physiology, and to shed light on the function of sleep and
wake states in coordinating synaptic plasticity during learning."

 Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is an epidemic and the incidence is continuing to
rise. Despite the prevalence of HFpEF, classical heart failure treatments and novel drug targets have failed to
elucidate an effective therapy. HFpEF is characterized by “damage from without” the myocardium with extra-
cardiac comorbidities such as obesity, hypertension and metabolic syndrome. A chronic state of systemic low-
grade inflammation induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in endothelial cells and nitrosative stress.
This culminates in impaired cardiomyocyte relaxation preventing proper filling of the left ventricle and reduced
cardiac reserve.
 The innate immune system is a driving force behind HFpEF. As a result of systemic inflammation,
monocyte migration into the sub-endothelium is promoted by upregulations in vascular cell adhesion molecule
(VCAM) and E-selectin on endothelial cells. Additionally, cardiac biopsies of HFpEF patients show elevations in
the pro-fibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. Along with observed increased cardiac fibrosis, this
suggests a role for the activation of macrophages (Mɸ), however, their exact function in HFpEF pathophysiology
is unknown.
 Clinically, elevations in the solubilized form of Mɸ anti-inflammatory receptor MerTK (solMER) have led
us to explore its function in HFpEF. MerTK plays an important role in maintaining tissue homeostasis through
phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis). However, MerTK also plays a role in cell survival, lipid uptake,
and inflammation resolution. MerTK has previously been implicated in cardiac repair after ischemic injury by
promoting phagocytosis of dying cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, in contrast to ischemic injury, our preliminary
data suggest that MerTK may be promoting HFpEF instead of acting in its usual cardioprotective role.
 Specifically, this proposal hypothesizes that Mɸ MerTK exacerbates the development or
persistence of HFpEF through the promotion of excessive MerTK-stimulated cardiac fibrosis triggered
by the combined HFpEF risk factors of high fat and nitrosative stress. This hypothesis will be tested using
mouse models of HFpEF in combination with MerTK knockout and inhibition. Mechanism-specific questions will
be supplemented with in vitro gene expression characterization. The proposed studies will identify a potential
new drug target for treatment and prevention of HFpEF, something desperately needed in clinic."

ESKAPE pathogens are a leading cause of drug resistant infections and the need to identify new antibacterial
strategies is critical. Iron is an essential micronutrient for survival and virulence that microbial pathogens which
actively sequesters iron away from microorganisms. Pathogens overcome this iron limitation through a variety
of mechanisms, including the synthesis and secretion of siderophores that scavenge ferric (Fe3+) iron, the
uptake of ferrous (Fe2+) iron via Feo or NRAMP-like systems, and acquisition of iron from host heme. iron
acquisition and homeostasis by microbial pathogens is multifactorial and dependent on sophisticated
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory networks. We have recently shown the PhuS cytoplasmic
heme binding protein has a dual function in regulating heme flux through HemO, and in the transcriptional
regulation of the iron and heme regulated sRNA’s PrrF and PrrH. The PrrF sRNAs bind to complementary
sequences of their target RNAs causing the RNAseE and Hfq-dependent mRNA degradation of genes involved
in iron-storage and oxidative stress, aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, including iron containing proteins of
the TCA cycle, as well as several virulence factors. Therefore, regulation of the heme flux through HemO is a
critical link between heme metabolism and the iron-dependent sRNA regulatory network required for
adaptation and virulence within the host. The goal of the proposal is to understand at a molecular level how
heme acquisition is integrated into these regulatory networks. Specifically, we will; i) determine the PhuS
structural motifs required for heme transfer and binding to the prrF1 promoter (PprrF1), ii) define the in vivo
effects of PhuS variants on PrrF/H sRNAs and the downstream regulon. and iii) determine evolutionary
conservation and function of PhuS homologs across enteric pathogens. On completion of the studies we will
have determined the role of extracellular heme metabolism in the iron-dependent regulatory networks of three
significant human pathogens, providing a platform for the identification of antibacterial strategies at the
interface between of iron homeostasis and virulence."

Oxidative alkene functionalization reactions are a fundamental class of organic reactions. These reactions
are valuable because they transform readily accessible alkene starting materials into diverse polar functional
groups. However, the design strategies that underpin conventional alkene oxidation reactions require
electrophilic reagents that serve as both the oxidant and the source of the newly installed functional group.
This substantially limits the chemical diversity accessible using these methodologies. A modular approach to
alkene oxidation that directly leverages abundant nucleophiles is a long-standing challenge with no general
solutions.
This proposal is based on a recent discovery from my group that electrochemistry can generate a new class
of dicationic adducts between alkenes and thianthrene that are exceptionally selective dielectrophiles. We will
study how these adducts can be exploited to develop a suite of alkene oxidation reactions that are otherwise
infeasible with modern synthetic tactics. The three specific aims of this research explore distinct but
interwoven aspects of this new reaction platform.
Aim 1. We are advancing a strategy for strained ring synthesis from abundant precursors
Aim 2. We are advancing a modular platform for oxidative alkene heterodifunctionalization
Aim 3. We are advancing a strategy for allylic amine synthesis from abundant precursors
The methods developed through this work each address long-standing challenges in a fundamental class of
organic reactions, alkene oxidations. These new reaction protocols will offer an expanded and diversified pool
of building blocks from which the next generation of drugs and molecular probes will be discovered."

Cardiac fibrosis impairs heart function and increases risk for cardiac arrhythmias. The transforming
growth factor beta (TGFβ) family is major driver of fibrosis, including cardiac fibrosis. Latent TGFβ binding
proteins (LTBPs) are extracellular matrix proteins that restrict latent TGFβ release and activity. We previously
identified LTBP4 as a genetic modifier of muscular dystrophy, where we showed that LTBP4’s ability to bind
TGFβ was strongly linked to sarcolemmal stability and fibrosis. LTBP4 is found along the exterior surface of
the sarcolemma in myofibers, and LTBP4 is similarly found on the exterior surface of cardiomyocytes in a
striated pattern. Because LTBP4 is highly expressed in the heart, LTBP4 is well positioned to regulate latent
TGFβ release in cardiac fibrosis. The LTBP4 genes in mice and humans have naturally occurring protective
and deleterious forms which produce proteins associated with differential TGFβ activity and downstream TGFβ
signaling. Mouse strains bearing the protective Ltbp4 allele have 12 amino acids inserted into LTBP4’s hinge
region, rendering the protein more resistant to proteolysis and latent TGFβ release. Correspondingly, mouse
strains harboring the deleterious allele of Ltbp4, lacking 12 amino acids, produce an LTBP4 protein that is
more susceptible to proteolysis leading to excess latent TGFβ release, signaling and fibrosis. In chronic
progressive cardiomyopathies, there is dysregulation of matrix remodeling, which can further enhance
maladaptive matrix shifts and adversely alter heart function and promote arrhythmia risk. We will now study
LTBP4 in the heart by probing TGFβ’s interaction with LTBP4 using three approaches. In Aim 1, we will use
decellularized matrices, called dECMs, from mouse hearts to define components and activity necessary for
cellular communication between cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. In Aim 2, we will evaluate human
induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, and we will also conduct in vivo assessment of blocking
TGFβ release in mice using an anti-LTBP4 antibody to promote cardiac sarcolemmal stability and reduce
cardiac fibrosis. In Aim 3, we will evaluate cellular crosstalk mediated by LTBP4 in human engineered heart
tissues (EHTs). Through this work, we will expand the mechanistic understanding of LTBP’s regulation of
TGFβ with the goal of therapeutically modifying the matrix."
10878744,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder and is a major cause of stroke. Despite its
rapidly rising incidence, current therapies are suboptimal. This is largely because current AF therapies,
including ablation, are not targeted to the fundamental mechanisms underlying AF. AF is characterized by
complex electrical activation patterns that are difficult to map using standard activation time mapping. Yet,
there is growing evidence that AF is driven by stable sources in the atria, such as rotors or focal activity.
Unfortunately, previous attempts to use AF electrograms to detect these sources have had mixed success. We
have recently developed an electrogram morphology recurrence (EMR) analysis that appears to more
accurately reflect molecular and electrophysiological substrate for AF than previously described AF
electrogram measures of AF. Our recent studies suggest that regions of high recurrence morphology with the
shortest cycle lengths (i.e. regions of low recurrence cycle length - CLR) may correspond to regions of
increased parasympathetic innervation and/or increased oxidative injury. Furthermore, our clinical studies
suggest that in patients with persistent AF, EMR mapping is both feasible and provides important physiologic
information. Our overall hypothesis for this proposal is: ‘sites of high recurrence morphology with the shortest
cycle length (i.e. CLR) represent regions of increased autonomic signaling and/or increased oxidative injury,
which are critical to the maintenance of persistent AF.’ To test this hypothesis, we will use novel gene therapy
approaches developed in our lab, as well as a CLR-guided ablation strategy in patients with persistent AF. In
Specific Aim 1, we will assess in a canine rapid atrial pacing model of AF whether targeted inhibition of
parasympathetic signaling – by expression of plasmids expressing Gαi/o inhibitory peptides (Gαi/o_ct) at the
atrial sub-region with lowest CLR – will reverse electrical remodeling and AF. In Specific Aim 2, we will assess
in the same canine model whether targeted inhibition one or more of the two major sources of oxidative injury
in AF - by expression of NOX2 shRNA  mitochondrial catalase at the atrial sub-region with lowest CLR – will
reverse electrical remodeling, prevent progression of fibrosis and decrease AF. In Specific Aim 3, patients with
persistent AF who are undergoing catheter ablation will be randomized to a CLR guided ablation strategy or
PVI alone; we will determine whether in these patients a CLR guided ablation strategy will increase ECG
dominant frequency compared to PVI alone. Completion of all the aims will provide a clear path to using EMR
mapping as a new diagnostic method to guide therapeutic intervention for AF. This proposal leverages the
prior development and validation of EMR to test several novel targeted approaches for treating AF. As AF may
have complex underlying pathophysiology, it is feasible that one or more of these approaches could be
therapeutic and could ultimately be used in combination. This proposal provides a critical platform to advance
the science of curative therapy for AF."

The overall project goal is to investigate zinc supplementation in combination with standard antibiotic therapy
as a simple, low-cost, and readily available intervention to improve survival and treatment outcomes for
Tanzanian young infants hospitalized with ‘clinical severe infection’ as defined by WHO IMCI criteria. To meet
these goals, we propose to conduct a ‘gold standard’ randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of zinc
supplementation in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
Briefly, we will enroll 3,250 Tanzanian young infants (0-59 days) hospitalized with clinical severe infection in
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. All young infants will receive standard antibiotic treatment and will be randomized to
receive a 14-day course of twice-daily oral 5 mg elemental zinc supplements (10 mg per day) or a matching 14-
day course of a twice-daily placebo regimen. Participants will be followed-up for 90 days to assess vital status
and treatment outcomes. We will also collect biological specimens to evaluate potential mechanisms of action
and assess modification of any treatment effect by etiology of infection. The primary outcomes of the trial are
i) 90-day all-cause mortality and ii) Treatment failure (composite endpoint of death, a new requirement for life
support or need to change to second-line antibiotics). The secondary outcomes of the trial include a) time to
cessation of signs and symptoms of clinical severe infection, b) time to hospital discharge, c) risk of re-
hospitalization and d) 90-day change in nutritional status as assessed by length-for-age, weight-for-length, and
weight-for-age z-scores.
Evidence from this randomized trial is urgently needed as low-cost and high-impact innovation to improve
young infant survival will be required for Tanzania and other developing countries to reach the child mortality

The genetic basis of >2,920 Mendelian conditions (MCs) remains unknown, and hundreds of novel MCs are
described each year. Our group has, in partnership with 2,379 investigators from 656 institutions in 55 countries,
assessed 15,387 samples from 5,675 families and has, over the past decade, identified genes for 1379 MCs,
including 915 novel discoveries. The translation and impact of these discoveries on diagnostics and clinical care
has been immediate and substantial. Additionally, we have developed multiple new analytical tools including
CADD, PRIMUS, CoNIFER, SMRT-SV, RV-TDT, as well as methodological innovations including MIPs, smMIPs,
and approaches for low input exome and genome sequencing (ES/WGS). We are also deeply committed to open
data sharing with rolling submission of exome and genome data to the AnVIL (1,439 deposited); development of
a MatchMaker Exchange node (http://MyGene2.org) that enables public sharing of genotype and phenotypic
data among families, researchers, and clinicians; and creation of a public data browser
(http://geno2mp.gs.washington.edu) that links de-identified, individual-level genotypes from over 18,000
exomes/genomes to individual phenotypes. In this application, we build upon these successes to establish the
University of Washington Mendelian Genomics Research Center (UW-MGRC) with the overarching goal to
maximize novel gene discovery for MCs, with an emphasis on canonical MCs that have gone unsolved using
ES/WGS, and noncoding variants underlying MCs. To this end, we will develop novel approaches to inform
variant interpretation and functional validation for the human genetics community at-large and disseminate
results, data, and tools openly. We will capitalize on immediate access to sequence-ready samples from ~300
MCs (>26,000 samples), 1,500 samples suspected of harboring a causal noncoding variant for a MC, and an
aggressive sample solicitation plan in partnership with industry, academic centers, and other NIH programs. We
propose three specific aims: (1) maximize novel gene discovery for MCs by solicitation, sequencing, and analysis
of families with unexplained (i.e., no known underlying gene) MCs; classic MCs considered high priority by the
clinical genetics community and that have been recalcitrant to gene discovery efforts; and cases that remain
unsolved after prior exome or genome sequencing. (2) Develop new strategies for gene discovery for unsolved
MCs caused by variants that are difficult to detect or of unknown functional effects (e.g., structural variants,
repeat expansions, cryptic splice, regulatory, etc.), and/or unusual modes of inheritance, and, in doing so,
characterize the genetic architecture of pathogenic noncoding variants underlying MCs. Implement high-
throughput screening and targeted follow-up functional studies to prioritize and validate assertions of
pathogenicity of candidate noncoding variants. (3) Take a leadership role to openly and publicly, when feasible,
share sequencing and rich phenotypic metadata, methods, and knowledge, to empower investigators worldwide
and accelerate the pace of gene discovery."
10754246,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The thirteen-lined ground squirrel is an obligate hibernator that seasonally drops its body temperature from
37° in the active state to 2-4°C during torpor. While such temperatures typically inhibit peripheral signaling in
mammals, torpid squirrels remain sensitive to tactile cues and can be awakened by the sense of touch
(mechanosensation). However, the neurobiological mechanisms involved remain unknown. The long-term
goal of this study is to identify the cellular and molecular signatures that afford cold-resistant
mechanosensation to support extreme thermal tolerance in mammals.
 Pressure stimuli are sensed by a specialized subset of neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) known as
mechanoreceptors. Mechanically gated ion channels such as Piezo2 convert pressure into ionic current that
activates voltage-gated ion channels, which relay the signal downstream through action potentials (APs).
Piezo2 and voltage-gated ion channels have temperature-dependent dynamics ripe for evolutionary
manipulations permitting thermal resistance. This study, which will be conducted at the laboratories of Drs.
Elena Gracheva and Slav Bagriantsev at Yale University, assesses the central hypothesis that ion channel
modifications in mechanoreceptors underlie cold-adapted mechanosensation in the thirteen-lined ground
squirrel.
 Past work from the Gracheva and Bagriantsev labs has shown that this species shows constitutively low
thermosensitivity and decreased function of nociceptive AP machinery during torpor. Our preliminary work also
shows that mechanosensitive currents are preserved during torpor. Accordingly, we use a combination of in
situ hybridization, RNA sequencing and electrophysiology to assess whether squirrel DRG neurons have
selectively potentiated mechanosensitivity at the cost of other sensory modalities, relative to mouse
DRG neurons (Aim 1). Moreover, cold exposure widens APs and disrupts voltage gradients in typical
mammalian neurons due to slowed kinetics of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump. In contrast, our preliminary work
shows that cold-exposed torpid neurons show decreased AP widening and intact resting membrane potential.
In light of these data, we use whole-cell and ex vivo electrophysiology to assess whether squirrel
mechanoreceptors have cold-resistant electrogenic machinery (Aim 2).
 To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to dissect cellular mechanisms of cold-
adapted mechanosensation in mammals. Elucidating neural function in extreme cold has the potential to
provide novel targets for combatting neuronal damage following clinical hypothermic procedures."

Chronic kidney diseases (CKDs) are a major public health problem affecting more than 20 million people in the
United States. African Americans are disproportionately affected by progressive CKDs, especially focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Genetic variants in the carboxy-terminal domain of APOL1 are
associated with FSGS and other non-diabetic CKDs in populations with African ancestry. These variants change
the amino acid sequence of APOL1 and explain much of this increased risk for CKDs in these populations. The
pathogenetic mechanisms that lead from these APOL1 variants to CKD are not known. The carboxy-terminus of
APOL1 interacted with VAMP8, an endosomal/lysosomal SNARE protein involved in vesicular trafficking and
APOL1 kidney disease-associated variants attenuated the interaction with VAMP8 secondary to protein
conformational changes induced by the variants. Like SNARE proteins, APOL1 localized to vesicular structures
in the podocytes of the healthy human kidney. We hypothesize that APOL1:SNARE interaction is necessary to
mitigate/attenuate podocyte stress response, and APOL1 variants disrupt functional SNARE interaction and
mediate cytotoxicity.
To test this hypothesis, we propose the following aims:
First, we will use stable cell lines expressing APOL1 and healthy human kidneys to identify additional interacting
SNARE proteins. We will use live-cell confocal microscopy to track APOL1:SNARE localization in various
subcellular compartments in the presence and absence of immune stimuli.
Second, we will investigate the cytotoxicity of reference and variant APOL1 proteins in the absence and presence
of immune stimuli and reference APOL1 in the absence and presence of SNARE knockdown in cell culture
models.
Through these aims, I will obtain biochemical, imaging and proteomics data necessary to address our long term
goal of identifying agents for the treatment of APOL1-associated kidney diseases. Understanding the molecular
mechanisms by which APOL1 variants cause proteinuric CKD is essential for the development of new
therapeutic strategies. I propose to use imaging and proteomics tools to study the pathological effects of APOL1
variants on its function and to learn bioinformatics tools to allow me to develop models to investigate CKD
mechanisms. As a young physician-scientist, this project will help me to acquire new skills and knowledge while
studying an important public health problem that afflicts my patients."

The University of Minnesota Medical School is committed to the recruitment, enrollment, research instruction,
and mentoring of a diverse group of high-quality medical students with aspirations of a career in academic
medicine. Based on surveys of medical students, as well as on an analysis by a faculty-driven Medical Student
Research Task Force, we identified research training in the summer between years 1 and 2 as the critical
opportunity to capture the interests and talents of academically minded medical students. Thus, this T35
competitive renewal application for a “Medical Student Summer Research Program in Infection and Immunity”
represents our plan to continue to provide high quality medical student research instruction and mentorship.
Our long-term objective is to significantly increase the number and diversity of medical students that obtain
paid employment in medical research, that publish during medical school, and that eventually enter into
physician-scientist training pathway residency programs. To this end, we describe herein our activities during
the first 5 years of the program (including years 1-4 of this funded T35 grant) and offer the results of our
current efforts based on the performance and perceptions of 30 medical student summer researchers. Daniel
Mueller, MD, initially developed this Medical Student Summer Research Program in Infection and Immunity,
and will continue to lead this T35 training grant. He has a breadth of experience in academic medicine
including a) laboratory-based research that includes both fundamental and human-oriented investigation into
autoimmune disease pathogenesis, b) medical leadership as a division director, c) an extensive undergraduate
and pre-doctoral training record, and d) direct patient care in Rheumatology. Mueller will be assisted by
numerous Medical School leaders with records of success in research and mentorship, and will receive
additional financial support from the Chair of Medicine and the Dean of the Medical School. A total of 31
outstanding Center for Immunology faculty members will serve as the preceptors for 7 summer medical
students in each year of the grant period. Diverse student candidates will be approached by the T35 director
on an individual basis, and encouraged to apply to the program. Students entering the program will receive
direct instruction in scientific investigation for a period of 2 months. Students will also receive weekly instruction
that relates the function of the immune system to human health. Training experiences will include the writing of
a formal “Specific Aims Page” proposal, as well as a “Progress Report” final summary of their research. In
addition, fellows will prepare and present to Center for Immunology faculty both a scientific poster and oral
presentation of their work. Finally, trainees will be given the opportunity for longitudinal mentorship regarding
the physician-scientist career path throughout their medical school experience. Success in this program will be
monitored both through longitudinal surveys of students and training faculty as well as through oversight by
both Internal and External Advisors."

of our research enterprise by encouraging trainee involvement in identifying and participating in new
collaborations; 4) Reduce time to completion from the current average 5.6 years to 4.5 years, which is
addressed by substantial curricular reform; 5) Increase the completion rate for all trainees. In the past 5-years
98% of well-represented trainees but only 85% from underrepresented groups completed the PhD. Improved
retention is based on efforts to build a more inclusive training environment that supports and values diversity at
all levels. Trainees from this program will enter the biomedical research workforce with the expertise in a basic
biomedical discipline and skills to independently acquire knowledge to advance their chosen field."

Protein synthesis and active transport of vesicular cargoes are vital to development of all tissues and to the
targeted delivery of organelles, proteins, and signaling molecules in eukaryotes. Accordingly, defects in protein
expression and transport are linked to developmental, neurodegenerative, pigmentation, immunological, and
other diseases. Knowing the detailed mechano-chemistry and structural dynamics of the ribosome and motor
proteins is essential for understanding and interpreting their roles in the cell. We have developed a number of
powerful new biophysical tools that reveal the structural dynamics and reaction kinetics of the protein synthesis
elongation cycle and cargo transport in muscle and non-muscle molecular motors under applied mechanical
force. We will apply these unique tools to investigate the rhythm of protein synthesis and premature termination
in eukaryotes. We will elucidate the divergent biochemical and mechanical properties of skeletal muscle myosin
and non-muscle myosins-I, V, VI and X. Understanding functional dynamics and mechanistic detail that have not
yet previously been accessible is now feasible. This MIRA grant coalesced 3 former NIH grants: the applicant's
section of a program project on molecular motors in cells, an individual R01 grant to the applicant on basic
biophysical mechanisms of molecular motors, and a multi-PI grant on protein synthesis. The links between all of
these different topics are that they are subject to formidable study by single molecule biophysics approaches
and they incorporate P-loop NTPases with many common structural motifs and principles. They can be under-
stood synergistically by studying and comparing their individual structural, energetic and dynamic features. Ex-
amples of this synergy are given in the body of the application. For the renewal period we plan to 1) continue the
successful development of state-of-the-art single molecule fluorescence and optical trap technology, 2) apply
these methods to a series of myosin isoforms that have been described in the literature as having qualitatively
different properties, 3) build a new class of intracellular force-FRET sensors for studying mechanobiological
signaling from the peripheral environment of a cell to control of gene expression in the nucleus, 4) compare and
contrast mechanisms of eukaryotic protein synthesis with the bacterial system, 5) elucidate the detailed mecha-
nisms for enhancement, during protein synthesis, of premature termination codon (PTC) read-through by phar-
maceuticals that are candidates for therapy in PTC diseases (e.g. Duchenne muscular dystrophy and cystic
fibrosis,) and 5) a new venture to test processive translocation by AAA+ domain ring proteins, including Hsp104
(which disaggregates toxic amyloid proteins) and katanin (which modulates microtubule length by severing and
is also tied to diseases). Overall, these studies will lead to a much more general view of the mechanisms and
characteristics of the ribosome and molecular motors in vitro and in live cells leading to a more rigorous under-
standing of their functions in cell biology and disease."

 Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), characterized by hepatic triglyceride accumulation and inflammation,
is a growing public health problem that affects about 7% of the U.S. population. It is hypothesized that maternal
obesity exerts the first metabolic hit to the fetal liver, priming it for fat accumulation and increased susceptibility
to NASH, whereas a postnatal obesogenic environment imposes further hits that result in NASH. In this proposal,
we will use choline, a semi-essential nutrient, to prevent the prenatal programming of NASH. Choline
plays an important role in lipid metabolism, facilitating hepatic lipid export and serving as a methyl donor which
modifies expression of lipid metabolic genes via an epigenetic mechanism. Prior research of our lab suggests
that maternal choline supplementation (MCS) in obese mouse dams prevented excess triglyceride accumulation
in the fetal liver partly by increasing the DNA methylation of the lipogenic gene Srebf1 and improved blood
glucose homeostasis in early adulthood. MCS also increased the abundance of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty
acids (LC-PUFAs) containing plasmalogens, a group of phospholipids that serve as sacrificial antioxidants, in
the offspring. Since the NASH liver is characterized by oxidative stress and LC-PUFA deficiency, MCS may
mitigate these risk factors of NASH. Interestingly, the beneficial effects of MCS was more prominent in offspring
whose dams also received high-fat (HF) feeding during gestation, suggesting an interaction between choline and
HF feeding. The objective of this study is to determine the interactive effect of CS with dietary fat on preventing
the prenatal programming of NASH. The overarching hypothesis is that prenatal and postnatal CS would
ameliorate NASH development initiated by a maternal HF, obesogenic diet; CS would synergize with LC-PUFA
supplementation to further prevent the prenatal programming of NASH. In Aim 1, we will determine the effect
of lifelong choline supplementation (CS) on preventing the prenatal programming of NASH by HF feeding.
Offspring mice born to HF-induced obese dams will receive a HF, high-fructose Western style diet (WD) post-
weaning to trigger NASH. Choline will be supplemented at different life stages to discern its effect by timing of
intervention during the prenatal period (first hit), postnatal period (later hits), or both (first and later hits). We
will use stable isotope tracing to discern the preferential partitioning of choline into its metabolic fates as
phosphatidylcholine or betaine, thereby influencing the hepatic lipidomic profile and epigenetic regulation later
in life. In Aim 2, we will determine the effect of CS and LC-PUFA co-supplementation on NASH prevention.
Both mouse dams and offspring will receive a fish oil supplemented HF or WD diet as well as CS. We will
compare the joint effect of fish oil and CS on NASH characteristics and lipidomic profile. This study will provide
proof-of-concept evidence for the use of choline alone or in combination with LC-PUFA as a cost-effective and
innocuous prophylactic agent for NASH programmed by prenatal and postnatal HF, obesogenic diet exposures."

 The objective of the Short-Term Research Training Program for AuD Students at Boys Town National
Research Hospital (BTNRH) is to provide a 3-month, full-time, hands-on translational research experience to
five predoctoral AuD students per year. This program is motivated by a shortage of audiologists who engage in
research careers. By exposing AuD students to an intensive research experience, we have a unique opportunity
to encourage AuD students to consider a PhD or otherwise pursue clinical/translational research careers. Each
trainee will be involved in all aspects of a research project, working in one of 22 BTNRH laboratories currently
conducting translational research related to audiology as it pertains to hearing, vestibular, cognition, and/or
speech/language sciences. Most of the 22 laboratory directors have extramural support in the form of R01 and
R21 grants. Trainees will work with BTNRH faculty mentors who have extensive experience working in a clinically
oriented, multidisciplinary research environment. The primary research experience will include (1) completion of
a research project that includes the design, implementation, data collection, and analyses for the study; (2)
reporting results of the research project at the American Auditory Society meeting the following spring; (3)
mandatory participation in a course in responsible conduct in research; (4) mandatory participation in a course
on the research process, in tandem with the other T35 programs, (5) participation in journal groups; (6)
attendance at seminars and colloquia; and (7) frequent interactions with each trainee’s mentor, informal
discussions with members of the research faculty and participation in community engagement events. Prior to
research participation, trainees will complete the CITI training course related to research involving human
subjects. Trainees will benefit from the experience of BTNRH faculty who have mentored postdoctoral fellows
(as part of our T32 training program), provided research training to AuD and PhD students from various
universities, and mentored AuD trainees who participated in the past 15 years of the T35 program. Trainees will
have access to centralized human subjects recruitment, clinical measurement and technology resources and
personnel for assistance with subject recruitment, data collection/training, computer software/hardware support,
and statistical analyses. Trainees will be recruited from AuD programs nationally, with special efforts to identify
and recruit trainees from under-represented populations. Several measures will be used to assess the program’s
success including (1) the number and quality of applications received, (2) exit questionnaires completed by each
trainee, (3) questionnaires sent to AuD program directors regarding the impact of the T35 traineeship on their
students, (4) the number of publications resulting from each traineeship, (5) the number of trainees who pursue
a PhD in preparation for a career in research, and (6) the number of trainees who obtain positions where research
is emphasized."
10763856,"A majority of HIV infections occur at a mucosal surface, which can include the rectal, vaginal, penile or oral
mucosa. Oral HIV transmission occurs in two distinct settings, breast milk consumption by infants born to
HIV-infected women and receptive oral contact with semen from an HIV-infected partner. For HIV+ mothers
the benefits of breastfeeding to infant health often outweigh the risk of HIV transmission, and as a result,
~150,000 infants are still infected with HIV each year. Additionally, epidemiological studies have provided
clear evidence that HIV can be transmitted through receptive oral intercourse. To date, studies assessing
mucosal SIV transmission have been impeded by the difficulties associated with not knowing exactly when and
where the transmission event has taken place. For example, when evaluating oral SIV transmission, we
previously identified SIV DNA and RNA in lymph nodes throughout the body at 24 and 48 hours but were
unable to determine if the transmission event occurred at one or multiple locations throughout the upper
digestive tract. This proposal addresses this issue through the use of innovative techniques that we developed
and optimized for HIV vaccine delivery and evaluation of changes in the draining lymph nodes following an
intraepithelial (IEp) vaccine injection to the oral mucosa. Here we utilize IEp injection to deliver the SIV virus
directly into the IEp space, a location associated with SIV entry and replication following mucosal infection.
This Precision Mucosal Infection (PMI) model allows us to know the exact location of the mucosal infection. In
our preliminary data, we have used PMI successfully to initiate both oral and rectal mucosal infections in
macaques. Importantly, by precisely defining the site of infection, enabled us to develop Lymphatic Tracking by
Indocyanine green dye (LTI) to identify with exquisite specificity the first draining LNs to contact the SIV virus.
We hypothesize that the first LNs to contact SIV are key to the initiation, breadth and magnitude of the anti-
SIV immune response, and early interventions designed to stimulate the innate or adaptive immune response
has the potential to improve this initial lymphatic response. The three intervention strategies that will be
evaluated are: A. Anti-retroviral therapy (ART), B. Type-1 interferons (IFN1) and C. SIV-Env vaccine. The three
aims of the proposal focus on immunological and virological assessments of different tissue sites impacted by
the SIV infection mucosa (Aim 1), entry to the lymphatics (Aim 2) and systemically (Aim 3). This study makes
use of novel targeted infection and sampling techniques pioneered by Dr. Smedley that allow for serial
sampling of the site of infection and primary draining lymph nodes. The research has the potential to: 1.
Provide insight into the earliest events following SIV infection. 2. Guide identification of therapies to reduce
morbidity and mortality associated with oral transmission of HIV. 3. Guide the establishment of PMI and LTI
for future SIV infection experiments at other mucosal sites. Our long-term overall goal is to develop novel
therapies for HIV+ individuals designed to improve outcome following an HIV infection."

The mission of the UCSF Graduate Program in Biophysics is to train diverse students to tackle some of the
most challenging problems in biology and biomedicine at the interfaces with physics, mathematics, chemistry,
and engineering, while equipping our graduates with the knowledge, tools, and skills to become leaders in
academic science, biotechnology, and affiliated sectors. With the extraordinarily rapid advances in
technologies and the new biological data they generate, there is an increasing need to understand the
molecular basis for complex biological behavior. Concurrently, advances in the ability to computationally model
molecular behavior are transforming biomedical research. To train leaders who can address the most critical
questions in their fields through integration of these disciplines, our program is designed to (i) provide our
students with both a foundation in quantitative, physical approaches and a sophisticated understanding of
biology; (ii) bridge computational and experimental biophysical methods; (iii) create an environment where all
students, including those from historically excluded groups, disadvantaged backgrounds, and persons with a
disability, are supported and succeed; and (iv) promote key skills for success in a wide range of careers. From
the start, “Onboarding” and community circles emphasize our values of collaboration, a supportive community,
and ethically responsible rigorous research. Our well-tested and new project- and team-based based core
courses lay the foundation to conceptualize, design, and execute innovative thesis projects. These courses
also build a foundation in the communication, leadership, management, and team skills we emphasize
throughout the graduate training. Current and new “minicourses” and “State of the Field” discussions facilitate
deep exploration of research topics in small groups with faculty experts, allow the curriculum to stay current
with latest scientific developments, and allow the students to identify important research questions. Students
can participate in career preparation workshops and internships, and many take on leadership roles in
outreach and teaching. Our alumni include leaders in both academia and industry, including several who have
started successful companies, and they actively participate in career development through our Biophysics
Alumni Speaker Forum and the new Biophysics Alumni Mentorship Program. Our goal to enhance diversity at
all levels requires activities to ensure continued success, formalized through an actionable plan that includes
required faculty training on mentorship across differences and increased guidance and support of trainees
throughout the PhD, in addition to the Biophysics Outreach Initiative and improved admissions processes. The
54 Biophysics faculty participating in this training program have an outstanding record of interdisciplinary and
collaborative research, and a strong commitment to mentorship and training. Chosen from a highly qualified
pool of diverse Biophysics applicants from a range of quantitative disciplines, we plan to appoint 6 trainees for
a duration of 2 years (in their 1st and 2nd year), for a total of 12 annual slots on this training grant."

(GRNs) and cell type specific transcriptional control mechanisms. They represent a featured
mammalian cell state in the ENCODE project for in depth chromatin and transcription factor
profiling. Furthermore, the loci encoding the antibody heavy and light chain genes (IgH and IgL)
have been used to uncover novel mechanisms of somatic DNA recombination and hypermutation
that enable the generation of highly diverse antibody repertoires and affinity maturation in
response to pathogen encounters or vaccines. Importantly, variation in the human B cell
regulatory genome has been associated with autoimmune diseases and vaccine responses. In
spite of these impressive advances, there has not been a comprehensive attempt to
delineate the cis-regulome of primary human B cells in their resting, activated and
terminally differentiated states or to assemble a signaling induced gene regulatory
network that controls the activation dynamics and differentiation of B cells. This has
impeded efforts to systematically analyze the consequences of genomic variation on the
structure and temporal dynamics of the underlying B cell regulatory network in human
health and disease. Based on our success in assembling the first comprehensive cis-regulome
for primary murine B cells by coupling structural and functional genomics, an inter-disciplinary
team is proposing to address the two major challenges highlighted above for human B cells. Thus,
we hope to advance a generalizable framework for analyzing the causal connections between
human genome variation and dynamic gene network regulation in diverse biological contexts."

Membrane protein effectors of pathogen interactions with host. The goal of this project is to develop a
framework for understanding the way in which the human host defenses interact with microbial pathogens and
age-related stressors. Many pathogens have evolved strategies to evade innate immunity by recruiting
complement regulatory factors onto the microbial cell surface. Moreover, the ectopic deposits that form in age-
related macular degeneration (AMD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are also rich in blood proteins involved in
innate immunity. Despite the biomedical importance of these processes, mechanistic knowledge is limited. This
research project is designed to address this knowledge gap. We focus on determining the structural basis for
two central interactions of human blood proteins involved in immunity, hemostasis and cell adhesion and cell
migration: (1) interactions with outer membrane proteins from the bacterial pathogen Yersinia pestis that are
important for pathogenesis, and (2) interactions with lipids and biominerals that are relevant to the formation of
pathological deposits associated with AMD and AD. Proteins in these highly heterogenous environments play
central roles in human health but are highly under-represented in the scientific knowledge base. We aim to bridge
this fundamental knowledge gap. Addressing these problems is important for advancing comprehensive
knowledge of the disease process and for developing diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic approaches. The
research strategy is multidisciplinary. It relies significantly on structural biology techniques, particularly solution
NMR and solid-state NMR.

 The hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is the key neuroendocrine system that controls
peripheral responses to stress. While the stress response is essential for survival, it can become
dysregulated. Hyperactivity of the HPA characterizes a variety of illnesses including alcohol use
disorder (AUD). HPA hyperactivity is characterized by higher production of corticotropin-releasing
factor (CRF) and glucocorticoids.
 This Phase II SBIR aims to develop a novel biologic therapeutic aimed at normalizing pathologic
HPA hyperactivity. Medications to modulate the HPA axis are currently sub-optimal. Therapeutic
attempts to use glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonists have shown some promise in conditions like
AUD and depression. However, chronically blocking GR-mediated effects can be counterproductive
as, for instance, it interferes with glucocorticoid negative feedback, leading to increased cortisol levels
and mineralocorticoid receptor activation. CRF receptor type 1 (CRF1) antagonists have been
extensively explored, but thus far have proven disappointing, possibly because of the
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties of the existing drugs. Therefore, the
identification of novel therapeutics to normalize hyperactivity of the HPA axis represents an area of
significant unmet medical need.
 This proposal will optimize a lead validated in the Phase I SBIR and establish a stable cell line for
the production of material for the eventual Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies and
clinical trials. Altogether, the present project will lay the foundations for the clinical development of a
first-in-class therapeutic for AUD and potentially for other conditions characterized by HPA axis
hyperactivity."
10839291,"PROJECT SUMMARY
TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer. While it is well understood that the ability of p53
to act as a transcription factor is required for tumor suppression, the key target genes downstream of p53
required for tumor suppression are still incompletely understood. Moreover, attempts at drugging p53 have
proven ineffective, generating a need to understand downstream players in the tumor suppressive pathway
to develop novel therapies. The Murphy lab has characterized three p53 variants termed “hypomorphs” that
are minimally impaired for p53 transcriptional function but have increased cancer-risk. These three p53
hypomorphs are impaired for transactivation of only a few target genes, with the top target gene impaired
being peptidyl-arginine deiminase 4 (PADI4). PADI4 is a regulator of histone modification via citrullination,
which is the process of deiminating unmodified or mono-methylated arginine to the non-natural amino acid
citrulline. Histone citrullination is predicted to regulate gene transcription and is known in some cases to
decondense chromatin. PADI4 dependent citrullination is also involved in immune cell activation and
recruitment. Previous reports have suggested PADI4 may act as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, and
the reasons underlying this controversy remain unclear. Additionally, mechanistic studies on PADI4 and
histone citrullination in cancer are lacking. TCGA analysis reveals that PADI4 is downregulated or mutated
in multiple human cancers, including mutations in 8% of melanoma, suggesting that this gene is a tumor
suppressor. I have found that PADI4 levels increase in response to genotoxic injury in multiple tissues, but
this is abolished in p53Y107H and PADI4 KO mice. PADI4 also suppresses the proliferation of both p53 wild
type (WT) and p53-null cancer cells. RNA-seq analysis of cells treated with the p53 stabilizer Nutlin-3a, +/-
si-PADI4, reveals PADI4 to be required for transcriptional activation of a subset of p53 target genes.
Collectively, these data suggest that PADI4 as a novel epigenetic regulator in cancer and may play a key role
in p53-mediated tumor suppression. I hypothesize that PADI4 contributes to tumor suppression through
interaction with p53, and through regulating chromatin organization by citrullinating histones and
opening chromatin at targeted loci. To test this hypothesis, I propose two aims. In the first aim, I will
establish the direct transcriptional targets of PADI4 in p53 WT and p53 null melanoma cells. I will also formally
test the hypothesis that PADI4 increases histone citrullination to induce changes in chromatin accessibility.
In the second aim, I will assess the tumor suppressive ability of PADI4 and PADI4 target genes in xenograft
tumor growth studies. Finally, whereas PADI4 has a clear transcriptional role, PADI4 is also known to
enhance antigen recognition, but whether this contributes to tumor suppression is unknown. I will test this
hypothesis. In sum, this proposal seeks to uncover new information about an exciting but poorly understood
epigenetic modifier and its role in tumor suppression and the p53 pathway."
10868427,"Fine tuning the efficiency of synaptic transmission is essential for learning and memory, while its disruption is
associated with diverse pathologies including autism spectrum disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders.
Thus, identifying mechanisms that regulate synaptic strength is a central goal in neuroscience. Since such
plasticity is frequently triggered by activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors, understanding the regulation
of NMDA receptors is particularly critical. Recent studies indicate synaptic strength and NMDA receptor
activation can be directly affected by the nanometer-scale organization of proteins within the synapse. Many
synaptic proteins, including vesicle release machinery and postsynaptic scaffolds and receptors, display a
heterogeneous organization with local regions of high protein density, known as nanodomains (NDs). These
NDs can be aligned across the synapse to form a “nanocolumn”, which our lab has demonstrated is the site of
action potential-evoked vesicle fusion and maximal receptor activation. New work from our lab has established
a novel role for the postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecule (CAM) LRRTM2 in positioning AMPA receptors within
the nanocolumn. While CAMs have well-established roles in synapse formation and development, these recent
findings highlight the possibility that CAMs may coordinate synaptic nanostructure and function in the mature
synapse. However, the mechanism by which presynaptic organization and vesicle fusion sites are communicated
to proteins within the postsynaptic density to enable alignment to occur remains unknown. In this proposal I will
investigate whether the presynaptic CAM PTPσ coordinates nanocolumn alignment. PTPσ is important for
synapse formation, is present in the mature synapse, and forms indirect interactions with both pre- and
postsynaptic machinery located within the nanocolumn. Loss of PTPσ impacts both pre- and postsynaptic
physiology, most notably NMDA receptor-mediated responses. Previous attempts to study PTPσ have relied on
chronic manipulations, such as knockouts and knockdowns. However, interpretations are complicated by its
initial role in synapse formation during development. I propose to elucidate the ongoing functions of PTPσ by
acutely disrupting its cleft interactions via cleavage by an exogenous protease. This highly specific and acute
approach will allow me to manipulate PTPσ’s cleft interactions to isolate their functions, without compromising
its earlier role in synapse formation. Throughout this project, I will use super-resolution microscopy,
electrophysiology, molecular biology, and live-cell imaging to test the role of PTPσ cleft interactions in
maintaining nanocolumn alignment and regulating NMDA receptor-mediated transmission. This work will provide
novel insight regarding the roles of a critical family of presynaptic CAMs following development and will test a
new candidate mechanism for the coordination of synaptic nanostructure and NMDA receptor function. The
training obtained under this fellowship will provide deep and diverse training in methodologies and professional
development that will prepare me excel in my career as an academic researcher at a biomedical university."

Stress exposure is a significant predictor of young adult alcohol use, with uncontrollable stressors, such as
natural disasters and mass traumas, being particularly harmful. Digital stress exposure, defined as exposure to
any stressful event through the use of a smartphone including but not limited to online news articles, social media
posts, and text messages, has recently received increased attention. Digital stress exposure has been linked to
increased anxiety and PTSD symptoms, and some report digital stress exposure as more stressful than in-
person stress exposure. However, research has yet to examine the impact of digital stress exposure on young
adult AU. The year 2020 presents as a unique window to explore the impact of digital stress exposure on young
adult alcohol use as a myriad of uncontrollable stressors occurred at global, national, state and interpersonal
levels, including the COVID-19 pandemic, racial injustices, and civil unrest. These stressors were amplified
through the media, making digital stress exposure frequent and often unavoidable. Simultaneously, reports
indicated significant increases in young adults' technology use and alcohol use. As young adults are at increased
risk of developing alcohol use disorders, and harmful drinking during young adulthood predicts later alcohol
problems, it is imperative that we investigate the effects of digital stress exposure on young adults' alcohol use.
Given that stressors occurred rapidly during 2020, it is important to examine stressors at the daily level in order
to capture the frequent stressors occurring. Additionally, microlevel contexts such as romantic relationships can
exacerbate stress and alcohol use between partners, making this context of influence equally important to
include. To fill these gaps, this research proposal utilizes a 21-day daily diary study implemented with young
adult couples during the beginning of the pandemic. This study utilized a novel data collection method wherein
participants uploaded screenshots from their smartphones indicating the most stressful digital event of each day.
The first aim of the proposed project is to adapt an existing coding system for the daily stressful digital events
and assess its validity. The second aim will examine if objective and subjective ratings of digital stressful events
are associated with same- and next-day alcohol use. Examination of subjective and objective stress ratings for
digital stressful events is imperative as desensitization and depersonalization during the pandemic may
contaminate participant self-reports. The proposed research project supports my training objectives: 1) obtain a
deeper conceptual and ethical understanding of the impact of stress on young adult alcohol use, 2) advance
quantitative skills in the area of intensive longitudinal data analysis, and 3) improve my abilities in scientific writing
and dissemination. Adapting an existing daily stressful event coding system for stressful digital events would
afford researchers the opportunity to identify specific aspects of technology use that impacts young adult alcohol
use, which may aid the development of prevention and intervention efforts by highlighting the underlying day-to-
day mechanisms through which technology use relates to alcohol use among young adults."

Despite the importance of math skills in daily life tasks, relatively little is known about the neural correlates of
math or its interaction with language processing in the brain. Prevailing literature posits that number sense, the
ability to grasp the concept of numbers, can be understood as two forms of numeracy: precise and approximate.
Unlike approximate numeracy, which is considered to be the innate ability to understand magnitude, precise
numeracy is thought to be strongly tied to language as it relies on symbolic communication and higher cognitive
skills. However, the neural basis of precise numeracy is significantly less studied than approximate numeracy,
and its connection to language areas has not yet been explored. This novel work investigating the neural
correlates of numeracy through the lens of known language areas and pathways will shed light on math abilities,
particularly as they relate to language, and will improve understanding of the consequences of related disorders,
such as the frequently co-morbid aphasia and acalculia following stroke. In order to fill in these knowledge gaps,
the project uses the lesion method to perform targeted region-of-interest (ROI), voxel-based, and tract-based
lesion-symptom analyses involving structural magnetic resonance imaging (T1, T2, FLAIR MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Data will be drawn from a sample of 75-125 individuals with left-hemisphere focal
lesions due to stroke. The project draws from an extensive array of numeracy and language behavioral data,
coupled with multimodal neuroimaging data that allows for different types of lesion-symptom analyses. The
hypothesis states that precise numeracy is supported by both the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) area that has
been strongly linked to approximate numeracy, and brain regions associated with language ability. This
leads to a further hypothesis that deficits in precise numeracy associated with damage to language-related regions and pathways will co-vary with deficits in language functions. In order to investigate the
relationship between language and numeracy processes, Aim 1 will use a targeted ROI approach to investigate
ROIs implicated in numeracy and language literature. Aim 2 will perform a data-driven factor analysis across a
set of 11 numerical and language neuropsychological measures, and then use the results in a multivariate lesion-
symptom mapping analysis to elucidate brain regions that contribute to both language and numeracy skills. Aim
3 will explore white matter connectivity of the numeracy and language networks through the use of univariate
and multivariate lesion-symptom analyses based on diffusion-weighted brain volumes. This research will
culminate in knowledge of both gray matter structures and white matter connectivity of the numeracy network,
particularly as it relates to the language network. Through a broad range of neuroimaging techniques and
quantitative methodology that address a novel area of symbolic communication research, the proposal will be
invaluable to numeracy and language research and the applicant’s ultimate goal of employing an interdisciplinary
approach for her career as an independent investigator studying language, numeracy, and cognition."

epidemiologic and follow-up questionnaires, clinical data, blood/buccal samples, tumor blocks, comprehensive
genotype data, including genome-wide association study (GWAS) data on population-based case- and control-
probands, extensive molecular characterization of the colorectal tumors, and genetic characterization of
participants for the cancer predisposing Lynch syndrome. All participants have been asked to participate in 5-
yearly follow-up, and with an 87% participation, have contributed a total of 470,000 person-life years and 1,000
incident colorectal and 4,700 incident other cancers. The resource has been used for 500 publications (132 in
the current project period) and 288 projects led by external investigators (56 in the past project period). In this
application, we seek funding for continued support of the cohort infrastructure, to continue follow-up of
participants, and to enhance the cohort with innovative characterization of value to future research on the
prevention, etiology and prognosis of CRC. We propose the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Preserve and encourage continued utilization of the Cohort and its resources
Aim 2: Update the cohort by follow-up of cohort members
Aim 3: Maintain and enhance the biorepository
Aim 4: Characterize incident colorectal cancers
Aim 5: Enhance and revitalize the cohort by recruiting the next generation
Aim 6: Enhance the cohort with microbiome data
Maintaining and enhancing our core infrastructure will facilitate our broad research agenda and will ensure that
the Colon Cancer Family Registry Cohort is increasingly valuable to research science and ultimately the public’s
health."
10829804,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of injury-related death and disability in the United States and
worldwide. The result of a bump, blow, or jolt to the head or penetrating brain injury, TBI disrupts normal brain
function in two stages: first, the primary injury at the moment of impact, and later, the immune/inflammatory
response, also called secondary injury. The inflammatory response that occurs during secondary injury can
contribute greatly to neurological changes including cognitive impairment, executive function deficits, emotional
and behavioral dysregulation. Currently, there are no approved pharmacological treatments for TBI despite the
incidence of TBI increasing over the past decade. Consequently, there is an urgent need for novel
pharmacological targets to control the aberrant secondary injury response. A hallmark feature of TBI pathology
is vascular disruption and Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) hyperpermeability. Strategies that target the
neurovasculature could open the door to new, effective therapeutics. It is known that the endocannabinoid
system is a major regulator of neuronal homeostasis and immune function. Of the endocannabinoid system,
the Cannabinoid 2 Receptor (CB2) is a major contributor to inflammation resolution. Importantly, our lab
previously showed CB2 is expressed at low basal levels on cerebral microvascular endothelial cells and is
upregulated during neuroinflammation. However, an unstudied aspect of TBI research is the kinetics of CB2
and its potential as a therapeutic target at the level of the cerebral endothelium. Specifically, here we explore
the ability of novel CB2 agonists to restore BBB integrity following experimental neurotrauma. Preliminary data
in vitro using synthetic chromenopyrazole based CB2 agonists, featuring increased affinity and solubility,
demonstrate improvements in restoring BBB function and attenuating endothelial activation. In addition,
analysis of gene expression in microvessels isolated from the area of impact shows rapid upregulation of the
CNR2 gene, which encodes for CB2. Therefore, we hypothesize that activation of endothelial CB2 following TBI
promotes BBB repair and vascular protection. This hypothesis will be explored using the following specific
aims: 1) to characterize the receptor dynamics of endothelial CB2 expression post-injury and the therapeutic
potential for potent CB2 agonists to provide vascular protection in both in vitro and in vivo models of TBI. These
studies feature advanced imaging techniques, neurobehavioral evaluations and novel highly specific CB2
agonists, 2) Identification of molecular mechanisms that bridge CB2 receptor signaling with pathways that
modulate BBB function. Together the aims proposed in this study will provide insight into mechanisms of TBI-
pathology and the effectiveness of novel CB2 agonists against the harmful effects of neuroinflammation."

Influenza is a respiratory virus that infects an estimated one billion people around the world annually. While there
is an influenza vaccine, it is typically only 40-60% effective and people must receive it every year. Additionally,
the vaccine does not protect against future, and possibly pandemic, strains of influenza and thus there is a major
need for new vaccination strategies. CD8+ T cells can provide cross protection against different strains of
influenza because they recognize internal epitopes that are conserved. Specifically, due to their position in the
lung, CD8+ tissue resident memory T cells (TRM) can rapidly respond to infection and mediate protection by
reducing viral loads and immunopathology. In mice, studies have shown that influenza-specific CD8+ lung TRM
have limited durability, but it is unknown how long lung TRM survive in humans. Additionally, the mechanisms by
which lung TRM cytokines reduce viral loads and immunopathology is unknown in mice, and even less is known
about the function of lung TRM in humans. Here, we propose a series of experiments to fill these critical gaps in
knowledge. In Aim 1, we will use longitudinal bronchoalveolar lavage samples from lung transplant patients and
antibodies specific for mismatched HLA alleles between recipient and donor to track the duration of donor lung
TRM and the development of recipient lung TRM by flow cytometry. Additionally, we will determine the dynamics
of flu-specific human lung TRM by performing immunophenotyping on longitudinal bronchoalveolar lavage, blood,
and nasal lavage samples from lung transplant patients that become infected with influenza. In Aim 2, we will
obtain healthy lungs that are unable to be transplanted in order to examine the effector functions of human lung
TRM. Lung cells will be stimulated with influenza peptide pools to determine the cytokines produced by influenza-
specific lung TRM, and the impact those cytokines have on neighboring cells in the lung tissue. Additionally, we
will then use mice to mechanistically determine the effect of individual lung TRM cytokines to reduce viral loads
and activate neighboring innate cells. Through this proposed work we hope to better understand the role that
human lung TRM play in the immune response to influenza. Lastly, as lung TRM are generated in response to
respiratory viruses, and not just influenza, results of this study could provide insights into the immune system
that could improve vaccine design for all respiratory viruses and aid in the prevention of future global pandemics."
10746850,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is ranked as the second most common cause of cancer-related death globally.
Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) remains the only first-line treatment for unresectable intermediate-
stage HCC, despite the fact that this stage is comprised of a heterogeneous group of patients with a wide range
of liver function, variable tumor number and size. In clinical practice only 50-60% of patients with intermediated
HCC benefit from TACE, thus repeated rounds of TACE therapy are performed to achieve maximum tumor
recession. The critical factors that impact the effectiveness of TACE therapy are the worsening of liver function
and tumor recurrence. The former arises from progressive off-target embolic ischemic injury to the liver, while
the latter results from hypoxia-induced angiogenesis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor
growth triggered by TACE. These processes inevitably dominate the course of this disease resulting in poor long
term survival, with a 5-year survival rates <12%. Novel therapies against HCC are urgently needed as the
incidence of HCC is steadily increasing in the United States. In recent years the natural omega-3 fatty acid,
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been shown to possess promising anticancer properties and its consumption
has been implicated in reducing the risk of HCC. The effects of dietary DHA on established solid tumors is
nominal. To address this issue, our lab has engineered a novel low-density lipoprotein (LDL) based biologic that
is reconstituted with unesterified DHA (herein referred to as LDL-DHA). Therapeutically, we have shown in a
syngeneic rat model of HCC, that transarterial delivery of LDL-DHA is able to induce extensive necrosis (>80%)
of HCC tumors and impede the tumor growth (3 fold) without injury to surrounding normal liver. Moreover,
repeated intra-arterial LDL-DHA treatments was shown to provide sustained regression of HCCs. Furthermore,
the uptake of LDL-DHA in the normal liver was shown to be not only safe but potentially hepatoprotective. In
addition, recent preliminary data from our group has documented that LDL-DHA is able to downregulate HIF-1α
and EMT signaling in HCC cells, thus inhibiting tumor angiogenic/regrowth activity. The goal of the present
proposal is to evaluate the utility image-guided locoregional LDL-DHA therapy for intermediate-stage HCC. To
address this goal we will examine the following specific aims: 1) evaluate the safety of intra-arterial LDL-DHA
delivery in rat models of cirrhosis; and 2) compare the therapeutic efficacy of LDL-DHA versus conventional
TACE methods to provide sustained tumor control in a patient derived-xenograft rat model of HCC. We expect
that the combined work of these Aims will validate the safety of LDL-DHA treatment in preserving liver function
in settings of cirrhosis and demonstrate the efficacy of this therapy to provide sustained tumor eradication over
TACE. The LDL-DHA treatment strategy will be significant because it offers a new method of effectively treating
HCC while preserving liver function. Ultimately it is our endeavor to bring this technology to the clinic, where it is
anticipated to provide safe and efficacious approach to managing of unresectable HCC."
10841578,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In nearly all studies of comparative effectiveness, the investigators seek to estimate how an in-
tervention changes outcomes on average. That is, are outcomes for treated subjects better on
average than for untreated subjects? While the average treatment effect (ATE) is a useful sum-
mary of the treatment effect, the treatment effect may vary from patient to patient. The ATE is
a low-dimensional summary of a treatment effect, since it summarizes the overall effect of the
treatment using a single quantitative measure and ignores possible effect heterogeneity. Many in-
vestigators seek to go beyond low-dimensional summaries by estimating heterogenous treatment
effects (HTEs). The most common approach to the estimation of HTEs relies on simple statistical
methods. Specifically, regression models are widely used but may be biased due to the linear
functional form especially where HTEs that are nonlinear or based on complex combinations of
patient subgroups. Currently, there is considerable interest in developing more flexible methods
for the estimation of the HTEs. In this project, we will use the the doubly robust machine learning
(DRML) framework to develop improved methods for a variety of HTEs. The DRML framework
is a combination of semiparametric theory, machine learning (ML) methods, and doubly robust
estimators. The key advantage of the DRML framework is that it allows one to reduce bias using
ML estimation methods, while retaining the efficiency of parametric models."

 Clinical and research applications of the PET imaging are rapidly expanding from ever improving diagnostic
and treatment assessment applications to guidance of personalized treatments, ultra-low dose imaging, and
even interventional imaging procedures. Supporting these developments, reconstruction tools that are able to
reliably handle both typical and (ultra-)low count situations, imperfect data, and data from specialized imaging
geometries, with fast (near real-time) reconstruction performance are of crucial importance. The overall goal of
this project is to develop and investigate robust and efficacious Deep Learning (DL) reconstruction approaches
addressing these needs. A unique and innovative feature of the proposed approaches (compared to alternative
DL applications) is the utilization of list-mode data histogrammed into a very efficient histo-image format. TOF
data partitioned into the histo-image format are characterized by strong local properties, thus perfectly fitting
convolutional neural network formalism and making DL training and reconstruction directly from realistic clinical
data (in size and character) highly feasible and practical.
 The clinical utility of PET systems has significantly improved over the years thanks to advances in
instrumentation, data corrections, and reconstruction approaches. Nevertheless, full utilization of their potential
through robust and fast quantitative reconstruction remains a challenge especially for the cases of very low count
data, such as in low-count temporal (motion and dynamic) frames, delayed studies, longitudinal low-dose
studies, and studies using new isotopes with long half-life and low positron fraction rates (e.g. in 89Zr-labeled
CAR-T cell imaging), as well as in specialized PET systems with partial angular coverage, for which exact,
artifact-free, reconstruction does not exist. These are the situations for which the developed DL approaches
promise great potential due to the demonstrated success of the DL networks to be trained for imperfect and very
low count data without reliance on accurate data models. Furthermore, pre-trained networks can provide ultra-
fast, near real-time, performance in practical use.
 Specific Aim 1 will develop tools for DL PET reconstruction using histo-image partitioning along with
procedures for training of the proposed DL approaches, including novel approaches advancing the state-of-the-
art of DL reconstruction directly from acquired PET data. Specific Aim 2 is directed towards study and evaluation
of the performance of the investigated DL approaches for whole-body and long axial FOV scanner data for the
wide range of counts from applications such as typical FDG, low dose, delayed, low activity isotope scans, and
ultra-short frames in motion correction and dynamic studies. Specific Aim 3 will develop and apply motion
correction protocols involving the proposed DL reconstruction tools and test and study their efficacy for clinically
realistic situations involving non-rigid lung and heart motions. And finally, Specific Aim 4 is dedicated to an
application and study of the developed DL approaches to specialized PET systems with partial angular coverage.

10800804,"Muco-obstructive airway diseases including asthma, COPD, cystic fibrosis, and non-CF bronchiectasis have
diverse genetic and environmental origins, but have certain common features that includes pathologic epithelial
changes referred to as mucous metaplasia. Airway secretory cells differentiate into mucous cells with a goblet
cell morphology packed with mucin granules containing MUC5AC and, to lesser extent, MUC5B. These airway
diseases are characterized by frequent exacerbations due to mucous hypersecretion and blockage of the
airways that leads to loss of lung function, hospitalization, and risk of death. While many of the factors that
cause mucous metaplasia have been identified, little is known about how it resolves. Autophagy is a key
cellular protein recycling system that degrades proteins in response to nutrient deprivation, inflammation, and
infection. We have spent the last several years studying the role of autophagy in airway disease using models
with genetic deletions of a key autophagy regulatory genes. In this application, we propose a new paradigm in
which mucin granule degradation contributes to resolution of mucous metaplasia through the action of
autophagy. Three key findings in our preliminary data support this hypothesis: First, autophagy deficient mouse
and cell culture models accumulate more cytoplasmic mucin granules during mucous metaplasia and
particularly during resolution. Second, mucous metaplasia is associated with mTOR activation and increased
epithelial metabolism which is then down-regulate during resolution. We propose that this shift in metabolism is
the key trigger initiating mucin degradation during resolution. Third, mimicking this shift in metabolism with
mTOR inhibitors leads to autophagy activation and mucin degradation in human airway epithelial secretory
cells.
To test our hypothesis that autophagy leads to degradation of mucin granules, we propose three research
aims: First, we will determine how mTOR signaling contributes to metabolism change in the secretory cell and
ultimately to autophagy-mediated mucin degradation. Second, we will characterize the importance of
autolysosome-lysosome fusion during mucous metaplasia resolution by examinig vesicle trafficking, lysosome
biogenesis, and lysosome proteolytic function. Third, we will explore mucin degradation as a therapeutic
strategy in models of muco-obstructive airway diseases. These findings can provide the framework for a new
therapeutic strategy to hasten the resolution of airway disease exacerbations."

 Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) underlies many spinal disorders resulting in debilitating back
pain, disability, and tremendous economic loss. Aging is the greatest risk factor for IDD and yet the biology of
disc aging is still poorly understood. Our prior research demonstrated that persistent DNA damage promotes
senescent cells resulting in their acquisition of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that
produces copious inflammatory and catabolic factors that promote disc matrix loss, a universal feature of disc
aging and degeneration. While these findings greatly advance our understanding of disc aging, they also raise
important questions. Does cellular senescence mainly drive disc aging locally, systemically, or both? In other
words, do senescent disc cells with tissue-destroying SASP locally drive disc aging in a cell-autonomous
manner, or do senescent cells from other tissues systemically promote disc aging through the endocrine action
of their SASP and signaling factors through non-cell autonomous mechanisms? Moreover, which of the two
major cellular senescence pathways, p16INK4a or p21Cip1, predominantly drive the local cell-autonomous effects
and the systemic non-cell autonomous effects on disc aging? Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize
that local effects of p21-mediated disc cellular senescence are only partially responsible for driving age
dependent IDD, and that contribution from p16-mediated systemic cellular senescence is necessary to
fully account for the observed disc aging phenotype. We propose three specific aims to test this
hypothesis using several innovative transgenic mouse strains: (1) Determine the relative contributions of local
(cell autonomous) and systemic (non-cell autonomous) processes in driving disc cellular senescence and age-
dependent IDD; (2) Determine the relative contributions of p21CIP1 and p16INK4a -mediated cellular senescence
on age-dependent IDD; and (3) Test whether senolytic treatment can slow age-dependent IDD. Completion of
the proposed studies will determine whether disc aging is driven predominantly by local or systemic processes
and whether these processes are mediated primarily through the p21Cip1 or p16INK4a cellular senescence
pathway. Finally, our proposed studies will identify novel senolytic drugs for treating and slowing age-
dependent IDD."

 The Beatty group's research program is investigating how cellular proteins organize and interact in space
and time. We use the principles of chemical biology to create new technologies for labeling and imaging
proteins with an innovative set of reporters.
 Recent advances in imaging instrumentation and computational analysis have created new opportunities
for examining the molecular basis of disease with exceptional detail. Researchers can now interrogate
features ranging in size from single molecules (e.g., drugs or proteins) to whole organisms, uncovering how
proteins organize to create living systems. The central obstacle that has limited progress in such studies is the
shortage of methods for labeling proteins for fluorescence microscopy (FM), electron microscopy (EM), or
correlative light and EM (CLEM). As a result, multi-color imaging studies most often rely on immunolabeling—
a method with many drawbacks. Imaging across size dimensions, termed “multiscale microscopy”, would
benefit from new genetic tags for labeling proteins with bright organic fluorophores (for FM), electron-dense
nanoparticles (for EM), or other chemical reporters. Ideal tags would be small, specific, and biocompatible.
 The Beatty group has successfully tackled this challenge. In the last 5 years, our team created new
genetic tags named versatile interacting peptide (VIP) tags. VIP tags have the high affinity and specificity of an
antibody, but are an order of magnitude smaller in size. A small tag (4.3-6.2 kDa) reduces the impact on
protein structure or function, particularly when compared to 27 kDa fluorescent proteins (e.g., GFP). VIP tags
enable the effortless switching from conventional FM to high-resolution imaging, including EM, without
changing the genetic tag.
 We now propose to build upon this concept and further develop this technology. With the support of
NIGMS, we will expand the set of VIP tags to enable the imaging of multiple proteins at the same time. We will
add a new class of genetic tags that use novel dimerization motifs to facilitate multi-color, multiscale
microscopy. We will use new tags in optimized, user-friendly workflows for imaging receptors across size
scales and platforms, including FM, EM, and CLEM (i.e., multiscale microscopy). Throughout our work, new
tags and methods will be validated through in-depth studies of two receptors that control iron uptake:
transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) and transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2). We will make new discoveries on TfR2's
function, binding interactions, and trafficking by labeling receptors with environmental sensors, catalysts (e.g.,
for proximity-based labeling), nanoparticles, and other small molecule reporters."
10853137,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Recent technological advances have driven the development of novel, less invasive approaches for assessing
the tumor genome. In particular, the “blood biopsy” which leverages circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) released by
dying cancer cells, has potential utility for screening individuals at risk for cancer, determining those patients
likely to relapse post treatment, identifying actionable mutations to plan treatment and characterizing tumor
genome evolution. However, several challenges remain including the need to standardize collection and
processing procedures, optimize sequencing/analysis platforms, and correlate data generated from ctDNA with
patient outcomes. For example, factors such as time of day or vein used for blood collection (central vs.
peripheral) may influence ctDNA yields and reproducibility of the assay. Moreover, while evaluation for common
mutations can readily be performed using ctDNA (i.e., EGFR mutations in lung cancer), tumor types with low
mutation burden and/or large structural variants (deletions/inversions) remain more difficult to characterize.
Finally, prospective sampling of human patients to assess the predictive value of blood biopsy requires a
relatively long timeline (years). While such studies would presumably be ideal in murine cancer models where
disease progression is rapid, blood volumes are limited, repeated sampling can be difficult, and it is problematic
to accurately recapitulate cycles of treatment response and resistance. Interestingly, pet dogs spontaneously
develop cancers that closely mirror their human counterparts with respect to clinical course, molecular
dysregulation and genomic alterations, and as such they represent a unique model for improving blood biopsy
performance and application. Because pet dogs receive standard treatment (chem/radiation/immunotherapy) yet
experience a compressed disease timeline, critical information can typically be obtained quite rapidly. Toward
that end, we have generated preliminary data demonstrating that ctDNA is readily detectable in dogs with cancer,
that genetic changes concordant with those in the tumor can be detected, and that treatment has a variable
impact on ctDNA levels. The purpose of this proposal is to build upon these findings to credential dogs
with cancer as a relevant tool for blood biopsy advancement and use this model to optimize and advance
its application to human patients. Specifically, we will determine how various factors affect ctDNA yield,
assess concordance of tumor and ctDNA sequence data, develop and implement a diagnostic mutation panel
for patient screening, and conduct longitudinal studies to track both minimal residual disease and likelihood of
relapse. To facilitate rapid clinical translation of findings, we selected canine cancers with genomic landscapes
that have human equivalents: urothelial carcinoma (BRAF V595E), mast cell tumor (KIT internal tandem
duplication), osteosarcoma (large structural variants), lymphoma (Myc amplification, TRAF3 mutation) and
hemangiosarcoma (p53, PIK3CA mutation). Tools created through this work will have utility for ongoing as well
as future canine translational cancer research, thereby supporting continued development of this model system."

The goal of this proposal is to expand and extend the ongoing longitudinal Study of Transition, Outcomes &
Gender (STRONG), which is a cohort of transgender people identified from the electronic medical records of
three large integrated health care systems: Kaiser Permanente Georgia, Kaiser Permanente Southern
California, and Kaiser Permanente Northern California. The study now includes 6,459 members with an index
date (first evidence of transgender status) from 2006 through 2014. The transgender cohort is matched on
year of birth, race/ethnicity, site, and membership year at initial presentation (index date) with up to 10 male
and 10 female non-transgender enrollees. To-date cohort follow up extends through the end of 2016. The
STRONG cohort has already provided a number of new findings that will inform clinical practice. We found
that estrogen use is associated with several-fold increase in risk for venous thromboembolism and ischemic
stroke among transfeminine cohort members. We also found a much higher prevalence of psychiatric
polypharmacy and higher incidence of suicide attempts among transgender participants compared to matched
controls. Despite the importance of these results, many analyses were not feasible due to sparse treatment-
specific strata and the need for longer follow up. It is unclear if the observed associations can be explained by
a specific route of administration, dosage, or drug combinations. In addition, the STRONG cohort offers an
opportunity to characterize the distributions of a wide range of clinical health indicators and laboratory
measures among transgender people, which may help with the development of relevant reference ranges in
these population. In this application, we propose 1) including additional subjects at existing sites identified
through 2024, 2) adding a new site at Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States to increase geographic and
demographic diversity of the cohort, and 3) extending follow up through 2025. The final cohort will include as
many as 30,000 members matched to 600,000 referents. The methods of data collection described in the
current application have been successfully implemented previously. The new project will address three areas
of importance: 1) occurrence of acute cardiovascular events in relation to various aspects of hormone therapy;
2) changes in mental health status and incidence of suicide attempts among transgender people; and 3)
metabolic and hematologic consequences of cross-sex hormone therapy. The project will be carried out by a
team that includes experts in transgender health, electronic record-based data collection, s epidemiology and
specifically pharmacoepidemiology methods, advanced longitudinal data analyses, mental health,
cardiovascular disease, neuroscience and endocrinology."

 People living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) consume a high proportion of health care
resources but are not well-served by one-disease-at-a-time scientific evidence and health care delivery
systems. Primary care, focused on the whole person in their family and community context, has great but
under-informed potential to integrate the care of people with MCC, particularly community health centers
(CHCs) that focus on health disparity populations. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting societal and health
care system responses have uncovered tremendous care disparities, while also stimulating innovations with
great potential to foster integrated personalized primary care for people with MCC in an otherwise fragmented,
impersonal, inequitable health care system. In particular, telehealth visits in the context of ongoing person-
focused relationships, integrated mental health services, and outreach to high-risk patients with MCC provide
hope for advancing the equity and quality of care for health disparity populations. We have a unique
opportunity to study the effects of the pandemic in a national network of 926 community health centers serving
>2.6 million patients from health disparity populations. The proposed study will:
1) Identify evolving changes in health care delivery to people with MCC in community health centers in
 response to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath;
2) Assess the impact of these practice changes on care quality for people living with MCC;
3) Identify promising emerging strategies to improve health care for people living with MCC.
 We will conduct a time series analysis of practice changes and associated patient outcomes in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Monthly analyses will examine changes in practice processes, patient
outcomes, and workforce stability for health disparity populations and for people with and without multiple
chronic conditions. For a five-year period going back to January 2020 ― the month of the first known COVID-
19 case in the US and the start of responding public health and practice changes ― we will analyze and
publicly report, on a monthly basis, practice changes and patient outcomes, to rapidly inform decision making
about primary care of health disparity populations with MCC. Subgroup analyses will examine differences
across 26 states that have had different societal and policy responses to the pandemic. The findings from
these quantitative analyses of millions of patients being seen in hundreds of community health centers will be
used to identify a purposive sample of exemplars for in-depth case studies that put a face on the quantitative
findings and identify and characterize practice innovations that show promise in reducing health care
disparities and improving care for people living with MCC.
 Study findings will generate vital new knowledge on the effect of a pandemic on the quality and equity
of care provided to people MCC and will inform efforts to improve health care equity after a natural disaster."

ABSTRACT
HIV-1 prevention and cure strategies are urgently needed for people who inject drugs (PWID) with opioid use
disorder (OUD) or polysubstance used disorder (PSUD) given substantial risk for, and incidence of, HIV-1 and
others infection. Most prophylactic and therapeutic strategies under development for HIV-1 and other infections
rely on modulating host immunity. Nevertheless, we do not have a working knowledge of how opioids—which,
themselves, are immunomodulatory—and the lived experiences of those with OUD or PSUD (inclusive of
exposure to contaminated equipment, community infections, and physical and social environmental factors) alter
immune function in the absence or presence of HIV-1 infection and, thus, the efficacy of interventions against
HIV-1 and other pathogens. We hypothesize that opioids and OUD/PSUD modulate baseline immune responses
in the host (“function”), as well as immunity against other pathogens (“fitness”), impacting prevention and cure
strategies. Here, we propose a pioneering program to define, at unprecedented resolution, the cellular and
molecular impact of OUD and PSUD on immune function and response to pathogens, such as HIV-1. We will
also develop and utilize an innovative “compressed’ screening platform to functionally test, in high-throughput,
informed chemical and biological perturbations for prevention and cure strategies. More specifically, we will
deploy—and, where necessary, develop—cutting-edge single-cell and bulk genomic profiling methods to
generate functional hypotheses on how OUD and PSUD alter critical physiology associated with drug metabolism
(liver), innate mucosal defense (gastrointestinal tract (GI)), and adaptive immune function in tissues of relevance
to HIV-1 (liver, GI, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCS)). We will explicitly characterize and contrast
changes in the presence and absence of HIV-1 infection. To systematically test resulting hypotheses, we will
create and implement “compressed” perturbation screens to examine simultaneously the individual impact of
multiple chemical and biological perturbations on limited primary samples (e.g., PBMCs, tissue biopsies). This
will enable us to delineate how factors associated with several aspects of OUD and PSUD intersect with HIV-1
infection. Given my lab’s broad and yet deep interdisciplinary expertise in developing and applying innovative
experimental and computational technologies to obtain mechanistic insights into the cellular and molecular
drivers of human health and disease, and our team of committed clinical collaborators in Boston and beyond,
we are uniquely positioned to successfully execute this pioneering, transformative investigation of the impact of
OUD and PSUD on immune function. Overall, our work will define the immunological landscape of OUD and
PSUD, and inform strategies to improve baseline immunity and the efficacy of preventions and cures against
HIV-1 and other pathogens for those with OUD and OSUD, and the general population."

The Education/Outreach Core will engage with key stakeholders to magnify impact and dissemination of P50
Center activities and exert sustained impact on clinical practice. To achieve these broad goals, the Core has
three specific aims. First, the Core will maintain engagement with patient groups and build on our lengthy history
of patient collaboration and co-creation. We will build new relationships and strengthen existing partnerships with
patient groups to foster bi-directional exchange. Such engagement helps ensure that research and clinical care
are responsive to patient-identified priorities. Engagement with patient communities is essential for ensuring that
research findings can be effectively translated into meaningful improvement in health and wellbeing.
Deliverables from this aim will provide an evidence base informing best practices/approaches for engaging
geographically dispersed patient populations. Second, the Core will develop concise, evidence-based guidance
for referring providers to return genetic test results to patients. We will build infrastructure and create resources
supporting clinicians in returning research findings to research participants. We will draw on principles of
neuroscience, cognitive psychology and therapeutic education to identify the optimal visual presentation of
numerical genetic concepts to facilitate effective communication with patients/families with limited genetic
literacy/numeracy. Resulting deliverables will deepen clinician knowledge of best practices and accepted
reporting guidelines and will support provider confidence in using person-centered communication practices.
Using ‘design thinking’ (user-centered/human-centered design) to develop reference materials for clinicians will
ensure that resources are accessible, relevant and responsive to clinician and patient needs. Activities will
enable discoveries to reach patients/families in ways that empower individuals to use genetic information for
improved health and wellbeing. Last, the Core will curate and co-create patient materials and disseminate to
patients, families and clinicians via a user-friendly website built on ‘design thinking’ (user-centered design). We
will collaborate with patient organizations to respond to patients’ desire for reliable, curated information. We will
co-create solutions to unmet patient-identified informational needs and use ‘design thinking’ to develop and
launch a user-friendly website for electronic dissemination across multiple online platforms (smartphone, tablet
or computer). Deliverables from this aim will enable patients/families to learn about infertility, be informed of
emerging research findings, participate in research and find links to peer-to-peer support. The web-enabled
platform will also serve as an enduring, supplemental resource for clinicians (i.e. physicians, genetic counselors)
in providing infertility care. Providers can direct patients to the website to learn about conditions causing infertility,
find resources and support for improving health and wellbeing."

convene the world's largest group of researchers and clinicians specifically focused on androgen-excess
related disorders. Both the Annual and Update meetings bring together diverse participants to discuss their
latest research findings, to encourage future research collaborations and to disseminate relevant and accurate
health information to the clinical community and general public. The attendees represent several regions of the
world and a variety of disciplines including medical, pediatric and reproductive endocrinology, gynecology,
internal medicine, psychologists, epidemiologists, clinical nutritionists and physiologists. The two-day Annual
Meeting has a well-established format consisting of multiple sessions that include invited scientific lectures,
oral and poster presentations, meet-the-professor sessions, all with interactive and/or question and answer
opportunities. We provide travel awards for junior investigators and child care awards to encourage the
participation of the next generation of researchers and clinicians. The one-day Update Meetings, also held
annually, are focused on basic science research and have a specific theme. We have demonstrated
participation by females and underrepresented minorities in our meetings, membership and Board of Directors.
One of the new highlights is increased collaboration with patient support groups and actively engaging patients
and consumers in our meetings. The Society is composed of basic and clinical scientists and clinicians whose
major interest is the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of androgen excess disorders. The AE-PCOS Society
has successfully organized 17 Annual Meetings, 4 Update Meetings which are organized as satellite meetings
along with the ASRM and Endocrine Society meetings in the USA or stand alone in other international

10814166,"Macrophage expansion in the failing heart induces tissue injury and is thought to contribute to the progression
of heart failure (HF). The main contributors to macrophage expansion in the failing heart are cells that self-renew
and proliferate independent of the blood monocyte pool (and hence are C-C chemokine receptor 2 [CCR2]–).
However, the role of such locally-sourced macrophages in the pathogenesis of chronic left ventricular (LV)
remodeling is poorly understood. The normal heart harbors macrophages expressing CD206 (Mrc1), along with
the gene markers Ym1, Fizz1, and Arg1, that are primarily CCR2–. These CD206+ macrophages can be activated
by Th2 cytokines such as interleukin(IL)-4/IL-13. Moreover, secreted FIZZ1 contributes to myofibroblast
activation and fibrosis in other disease models. Our pilot data indicate that CD206+ macrophages expressing IL-
4 receptora (IL-4Ra) robustly increase in the failing heart, and suggest that macrophage IL-4/IL-4Ra signaling
promotes LV remodeling and fibrosis, in part through FIZZ1. Hence, we hypothesize that cardiac CD206+
macrophages expressing IL-4Ra and Fizz1 are innate immune mediators of adverse LV remodeling in chronic
HF, and key targets for therapeutic immunomodulation. Three Aims will test this hypothesis. In Aim 1, in a murine
coronary ligation model, using flow cytometry, cell sorting, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), and
immunohistochemistry, we will comprehensively define pathological alterations in cardiac CD206+ macrophages
in HF, including IL-4Ra levels and downstream signaling, FIZZ1 expression, and in vivo cell abundance,
proliferation, turnover and phagocytic capacity. Using scRNAseq, we will define novel functional subpopulations
of CD206+ macrophages at the transcriptional level in both murine and human failing hearts. In Aim 2, we will
establish the pathogenetic role of CD206+IL-4Ra+ macrophages in HF using CD45.2 inducible myeloid-specific
IL-4Ra knockout mice, deleting myeloid IL-4Ra during chronic HF, and assessing the late effects on LV
remodeling, inflammation, and fibrosis. To establish sufficiency of failing heart CD206+IL-4Ra+ macrophages to
induce tissue injury, we will adoptively transfer sorted cardiac CD206+ macrophages with intact or deleted IL-
4Ra from HF mice into naïve CD45.1 mice via intramyocardial injection and assess LV remodeling 6 w later. To
assess the role of FIZZ1, we will similarly transfer M[IL-4] polarized bone marrow macrophages from wild-type
and Fizz1-/- mice. In Aim 3, we will test potentially translatable therapies to antagonize CD206+IL-4Ra+
macrophages and alleviate chronic LV remodeling, including systemic anti-sense oligonucleotides against IL-
4Ra and Fizz1, anti-IL-4 neutralizing antibody, and GW2580, a small molecule cFMS kinase inhibitor. We will
measure the effects of these therapies on LV remodeling, cardiac macrophages, fibrosis, and chemokine/
cytokine expression. These studies will further our understanding of the innate immune basis for cardiac
inflammation in ischemic HF, provide novel insights into macrophage IL-4-dependent signaling and Fizz1 in the
pathogenesis of LV remodeling, and identify new approaches for cell type-specific immunomodulation in HF."
10848189,"PROPOSAL SUMMARY
Many older adults with autoimmune disease are treated with biologic anti-inflammatory therapies (biologics) to
control their symptoms and slow disease progression. Although using opioids to treat chronic and neuropathic
pain remains controversial, they may nonetheless be commonly prescribed to older adults with autoimmune
diseases alongside biologics. Opioids are also most often prescribed to older adults, who experience an
inordinately high prevalence of inflammation, pain, and autoimmune conditions due to aging-associated changes
like immunosenescence. The effects of opioids on the immune system remain poorly understood and they may
induce immunosuppression alongside biologics, leading to increased risk of adverse events, such as severe
infection, through pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction. Despite the coincidence of chronic inflammation and
pain in autoimmune disease, the safety outcomes from concurrent opioid and biologic use have not been
assessed. Therefore, prescribers do not have enough information on the safety of concurrent use of opioids and
biologics, and continue this practice, possibly to their patients’ detriment. This assessment of large sample of
over 3 million older adults enrolled in Medicare between 2007 and 2019 with autoimmune disease will produce
novel safety insights on the concurrent use of opioids and biologics, improving treatment outcomes for individuals
with autoimmune diseases. The long term goal of this proposal is to maintain the health and well-being of older
adults with autoimmune diseases through the optimization of treatment strategies. In service of this goal, we will
Determine the patterns and predictors of opioid use, biologic use, and concurrent opioid and biologic use across
an array of autoimmune diseases among older adults (AIM 1), assess the effects of opioid use on adherence to
biologics among older adults with autoimmune diseases (AIM 2), and examine the effects of opioids on safety
outcomes among older adults with autoimmune diseases using biologic therapies (AIM 3). These proposed
studies will be completed by the principal investigator with support and mentorship from collaborators with deep
expertise in advanced pharmacoepidemiology methods and opioid and biologics research. The principal
investigator is supported by a collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment that includes the world
renowned Center for Gerontology and Health Care Research and Department of Epidemiology at the Brown
University School of Public Health. The training activities detailed in this application, focused on advancing
quantitative computational skills and developing a deep contextual knowledge of pharmacoepidemiology, will
prepare the principal investigator for a career as an independent epidemiologist."

 Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is becoming increasingly available in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and as a
highly effective and user-controlled intervention for HIV prevention holds promise for those most at risk of
infection including adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). However, most of the increased uptake of PrEP
in SSA has been in a handful of countries with the world’s highest HIV rates, and where the HIV prevalence can
influence risk perception and willingness to use PrEP. Despite the rise PrEP in these and other regions where it
is available, most of those eligible for PrEP are not using it, and among those that do begin PrEP, discontinuation
rates in the months after initiation is common, especially for AGYW,
 In West Africa, where HIV rates are lower but unacceptably high, PrEP is beginning to be rolled out. Public
health authorities in Liberia have taken steps to integrate PrEP into the country’s HIV prevention programming
and have recently started pilot clinics to administer PrEP to men who have sex with men, transgender women,
and people who inject drugs. In 2023-24, PrEP will be expanded nationwide to include the largest key population
AGYW. These policymakers are deeply interested in developing PrEP programming that is preference-sensitive
and reflects determinants of PrEP engagement for AGYW in the West African context, which is distinct from
those of other regions of Africa. Therefore, we propose to obtain an in-depth understanding of the PrEP
perceptions and preferences among urban and rural AGYW in Liberia, their male partners, and healthcare
providers – applying the situated Information, Motivation, and Behavioral Skills (sIMB) model to guide our
investigations. In close collaboration with PrEP planners, we will then use Intervention Mapping framework
processes to directly apply the formative data to the development of implementation planning for PrEP for AGYW.
The resulting implementation options will serve as a roadmap for the critical next stage of PrEP roll-out in Liberia
and serve as a model for similar settings."
10838424,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Since the introduction of successful treatment for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) via antiretroviral therapy
(ART), individuals infected with HIV are now living longer with estimates that in the United States over half of all
HIV infected individuals and in California 67 percent of people living with HIV (PLWH) are over the age of 50.
Due to this major demographic shift in the HIV-infected population in the US, and as outlined in PA-20-149, there
is an urgent need to better define the underlying pathophysiology of neurological complications and
neurocognitive decline in the aging HIV-infected populations. Despite ART treatment, HIV-associated
neurocognitive disorders (HAND) occur with high heterogeneity in the pattern and severity of deficits, particularly
in people aging on modern ART regimens. Our research points to neuroimaging biomarkers that could be of
advantage for identifying diagnostic signatures and understanding the heterogeneity of CNS disease in relation to
behavioral manifestations, that would need to be followed up with longitudinal research. Bradyphrenia was
indicative of worse performance in other cognitive domains, mediated by basal ganglia-limbic brain pathway
compromise, and related to bradykinesia, a main symptom in age-related neurodegeneration in Parkinson's
disease (PD). Bradykinesia occurred in PLWH with more severe cognitive impairment and could be a sign of
disease progression involving more widespread brain networks. Our novel application of fMRI-derived amplitudes
of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) indicated disrupted neurodynamics in subcortico-cortical circuits in older
PLWH, with some overlap with the pathophysiology in PD8. Our research points to predictors of the interindividual
variation in impairment profiles related to past HIV severity (nadir CD4, AIDS), current CD4 count, older age, alcohol
and substance use, and sleep quality as a measure of resilience. Here, we extend this work in direct response to
PA-20-149, aiming to longitudinally investigate the neurocognitive profile using the NIMH's Research Domain
Criteria (RDoC) framework to evaluate previously identified neuroimaging biomarkers of cognitive and motor
deficits in aviremic older PLWH on ART. We focus on the role of bradyphrenia and bradykinesia for the discovery
of neuroimaging biomarkers for CNS disease progression by following our established study cohorts and new
recruits of older PLWH, Parkinson's disease (PD), and age-matched healthy controls (HC).
The specific aims of this proposal are to
Aim 1: Identify neuroimaging biomarkers for worsening in cognition using a domain-based approach.
Aim 2: Determine the role of subclinical parkinsonism for later impairment in PLWH, and similarities to PD.
Aim 3: Seek modifiable risk factors and moderators for disease progression in PLWH."

Ending the HIV epidemic (EHE) depends on developing innovative, strategic and tailored approaches to HIV
diagnosis, treatment and prevention. While new HIV diagnoses have declined significantly from their peak,
progress has stalled, particularly among Black men who have sex with men (MSM) who remain
disproportionately affected in the US. In the pilot study, Safe Spaces 4 Sexual Health (SS4SH), we
demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of a status-neutral HIV/STI testing approach which identified at-
risk MSM in online spaces and linked them to testing services on a mobile van in Baltimore, MD. Focusing on
reaching MSM in online spaces who may be missed by traditional seek-test-treat strategies, our pilot reached
151 MSM over 14 months and demonstrated a significantly higher new HIV diagnosis (7% vs. 0.5%, p<0.001)
and syphilis positivity rate (10% vs. 0.5%, p<0.001) compared to the standard of care health department (HD
SOC) mobile van strategy. SS4SH pilot did not evaluate participants’ linkage to PrEP or HIV care, which are
key pillars of the EHE strategy. The objective of this proposed R21 is to expand the pilot study to integrate
PrEP and HIV care linkage, evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of this expanded strategy and in a quasi-
experimental design, generate preliminary data on the effectiveness of this strategy compared to the HD SOC
mobile van. The specific aims are: 1) Using a community-based participatory approach, expand SS4SH to
incorporate linkage to PrEP for Black MSM at high risk for HIV acquisition and linkage to HIV care for those
living with undiagnosed/unsuppressed HIV, and 2) Using a quasi-experimental design, pilot the expanded
SS4SH testing plus care linkage strategy to (1) evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of adding care linkage
and (2) generate preliminary data on effectiveness of the expanded SS4SH compared to the HD SOC mobile
van as defined by reach, reproducibility of testing outcomes, and care linkage outcome measures. Aim 1 will
involve qualitative formative work including focus groups and in-depth interviews with Black MSM and key
informant interviews with care linkage stakeholders to explore environmental and patient level barriers to care
linkage and develop community engaged linkage strategies to overcome these barriers. A community advisory
board (CAB), composed of Black MSM recruited from focus group and interview participants will provide
member-checking of the study team’s interpretations of qualitative data and partner with the study team to
develop the expansion of SS4SH for care linkage to be implemented during the Aim 2 pilot. In Aim 2, we will
recruit MSM (ages 18-49) for mobile van HIV/STI testing/care linkage over 8 months. We will evaluate outcome
measures of feasibility and acceptability of providing care linkage and generate preliminary data on the
effectiveness of the SS4SH compared to the HD SOC mobile van strategy. The proposed research has the
potential to inform public health strategies prioritizing Black MSM and potentially reduce ongoing HIV
disparities by reaching both those at risk for acquisition and transmission and linking them to care."

This competing renewal, “Strengthening Child Health Research Capacity in Resource Constrained Settings”
(referred to as Researcher Resilience Training, RRT) aims to advance and test state-of-the-art research methods
training and “hands-on” research experience for advanced doctoral students and early career investigators,
specifically those of African descent or focused on populations associated with the African continent, committed
to addressing the serious threats to child behavioral health (CBH), as well as prevention and care disparities in
poverty-impacted contexts. RRT develops and supports a pipeline of new CBH investigators who are prepared
to advance scientific knowledge about system and community-level structural interventions that can address the
disproportionate health burdens experienced by poverty-impacted youth of African descent via enhancing
protective family, neighborhood, system supports; reducing disparities; and advancing racial and health equity.
The RRT is guided by 4 Specific Aims: Aim 1. Recruit 5 cohorts of advanced doctoral students and early career
investigators, committed to conducting CBH prevention, intervention, services, implementation, and scale-up
research within resource-constrained settings (Fellows; n=45 across 5 years); Aim 2. Deliver a summer research
training program aimed at equipping Fellows with skills to address the challenges in resource-poor settings
through didactic instruction, mentoring, “hands-on” immersion in child- and family-focused studies, individualized
consultation, goal setting, monitoring, and ongoing support in resources over time; Aim 3. Advance
academic/community/safety net system research partnerships on CBH and child well-being; and Aim 4. Examine
the short-term and longitudinal impact of RRT (across 10 cohorts; n=90 RRT Fellows). Fellows participate in a
2-week, face-to-face training program at Washington University in St. Louis. Fellows then spend 4 to 6 weeks
embedded across a set of existing CBH-focused research studies, exclusively led by investigators of color.
Scientists with advanced methods expertise provide intensive consultation and mentoring to Fellows and are
drawn from the collaborating Center for the Study of Race, Ethnicity and Equity (CRE2) in addition to WUSTL
faculty. A rigorous mixed-methods evaluation tracks individual Fellow progress, as well as the impact of the RRT
on overall CBH research partnerships."
10918050,"Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and periodontal diseases (PD) are complex chronic diseases with an established
bidirectional relationship. People with PD have two to three times the risk of having a heart attack, stroke, or
serious cardiovascular complications. PD in individuals with diabetes contributes to aggravated inflammatory
response leading to vascular disease (VD). Our group has previously shown that PD increases coronary heart
disease in diabetic patients. Nitric oxide (NO) mediated endothelial dysfunction is the initial step in the
development of VD. Reduced NO bioavailability due to the lack of tetrahydrobiopterin [BH4, a cofactor for
endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)], resulting in eNOS uncoupling, increases oxidative
stress/inflammation, impaired vascular smooth muscle relaxation and contributes to CV pathologies in diabetic
patients and rodent models of diabetes. Our previous studies demonstrated that chronic periodontal infection
reduced circulatory BH4 and NO levels and this reduction correlated with impaired immune signaling. In addition,
decreased levels of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived-2)-like 2 (Nrf2)-dependent antioxidants and increased
levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) also play a critical role in hypertension and vascular function. We
recently reported that primary human aortic endothelial cells (pHAECs) infected with Porphyromonas gingivalis
(Pg, a major periodontal pathogen), exhibited reduced cell viability, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines,
reduced Nrf2/eNOS and BH4 biosynthesis. In addition, our in-vivo rodent studies demonstrate that chronic
polybacterial periodontal infection [Pg, Treponema denticola (Td), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), a model
of PD in humans] reduced the protein expression of Nrf2/BH4/nNOS in resistance blood vessels of the infected
mice. However, the specific mechanisms that contribute to aggravated inflammation and oxidative stress during
PD and diabetes leading to endothelial dysfunction is completely unknown. Our central hypothesis is that BH4
regulates NO-mediated vascular function, which is greatly impaired in diabetic PD compared to diabetes or PD
alone. The specific aims are,1: To determine whether hyperglycemia (HG) aggravates PD-induced impairment
in BH4/NOS and NO downstream signaling in pHAECs. 2: To investigate whether increased endogenous BH4
biosynthesis suppresses PD/T2DM induced inflammation, oxidative stress and restores eNOS activity, NO
synthesis, and NO mediated vascular relaxation. The proposed studies will be the first to determine the role of
periodontal pathogens in NO-mediated vascular function in T2DM animal models. The research outlined in these
aims has translational relevance, as it has the potential to identify novel treatment; options for PD/T2DM induced
VD."
10831978,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of the current study is to complete IND enabling studies to develop a therapeutic based on
D6PV, a novel ApoC-II peptide mimetic, by conducting toxicology studies and manufacturing GMP drug
substance and drug product for future Phase 1 trials in normal healthy volunteers. Successful
completion of aims proposed here will result in the development of a novel peptide mimetic as an
intravenous formulation with a rapid onset of action for the treatment of hospitalized patients with acute
pancreatitis to rapidly reduce triglycerides to prevent or treat hypertriglyceridemia, and therefore will
reduce the length of stay in the hospital and reduce or eliminate the morbidity and mortality. A safety
assessment will be completed in IND enabling studies and a NOAEL (no adverse effect load)
determined to support first-in-human dosing. This will enable Protean Bio to advance D6PV for Phase
1 clinical trials in normal healthy volunteers to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of
D6PV after single and multiple ascending dosing regimens. Once completed and demonstrated to be
safe in humans, D6PV is anticipated to progress to Phase 2 trials in hospitalized AP patients for proof-
of-concept (i.e., efficacy) for reducing triglycerides in < 4 hours after administration as an intravenous
dose. AP is one of the most common diagnosis for GI-related hospitalization with significant morbidity
and at an annual cost of $2.6B. Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG) is a leading cause for AP and is
known to occur in up to 38% of patients with plasma triglyceride (TG) levels of 3000-5000 mg/dL.
Although there are several approved products (e.g., Vascepa®, Epanova®) and new modalities
(nucleic acid drugs, antibodies) in Phase 2/3 trials for the treatment of SHTG, they have a delayed
onset of action, rendering them unsuitable for rapidly lowering triglycerides in hospitalized AP patients.
Therefore, there is a clear unmet need for rapidly addressing elevated TG in AP patients in an acute,
hospitalized setting to reduce pain and progression of pancreatic necrosis, organ failure and mortality.
Superior ex vivo results were confirmed in in vivo studies in mice models of HTG, demonstrating a
~80% reduction of plasma HTG in 3 hours post dosing and ~85% decrease in plasma ApoC-III; the
latter due to displacement by D6PV and subsequent clearance. In this Direct to Phase II grant, we
propose to complete engineering validation of the non-GMP manufacturing process, complete IND-
enabling studies in rat and dog, and manufacture GMP drug substance and drug product."
10773626,"SUMMARY
Over the last 2 years humanity has been confronting COVID-19 pandemic caused by the new Corona Virus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) infection. Major gaps: Mutations and deletions often occur in the genome of SARS-CoV-2
(predominantly in the Spike protein) resulting in more transmissible and pathogenic “variants of concern” (VOCs)
that can escape immunity conferred by first generation COVID-19 vaccines. Because most mutations and
deletions that produced the 20 known VOCs are concentrated on the Spike protein, there is a risk that current
COVID-19 sub-unit vaccines based on the Spike protein will fail to protect against future VOCs despite inducing
strong virus-specific neutralizing antibodies against the original virus strain. Among the 80 mutations/deletions
present in OMICRON variant, 32 mutations/deletions are concentrated in the sequence Spike protein alone. This
emphasizes two major limitations of currently available vaccines: The need for second-generation universal
coronavirus vaccines that (1) target antigens (Ags) other than the highly variable Spike protein; and (2)
incorporate both B- and T-cell epitopes from Spike and non-Spike Ags that are highly conserved in all 20 VOCs
and that will induce strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Our long-term goal is to develop a
potent second generation universal CoV vaccine to stop/reduce SARS-CoV-2 infections and disease caused by
multiple VOCs. Preliminary Results: We: (1) Identified highly immunogenic human B and T cell target epitopes
from the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome; (2) Characterized human T cell epitopes from the whole SARS-CoV-2
genome that are selectively targeted by the “protective” immune system from asymptomatic COVID-19 patients;
and (3) Produced a first prototype multi-epitope universal CoV vaccine candidate using the validated mRNA
delivery system platform, and (4) Created novel “humanized” susceptible HLA-DR/HLA-A*0201/hACE2 triple
transgenic mouse model with which to test 7 additional multi-epitope universal CoV vaccine candidates that bear
different highly conserved human B and T cell epitopes spanning the entire CoV genome. We hypothesize that
one or more of our 7 universal vaccine candidates will protect “humanized” mice from infection and disease
caused by intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 a, b, g, d and Omicron VOCs. Our Specific Aims are: Aim
1: To design and construct 7 additional mRNA-based universal vaccine candidates that will incorporate highly
conserved B and T cell epitopes selected from 20 VOCs. Aim 2: To determine the safety, immunogenicity, and
protective efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 a, b, g, d or Omicron VOCs of 7 multi-epitope universal CoV vaccine
candidates delivered intranasally in the “humanized” HLA-DR/HLA-A*0201/hACE2 mouse model. The durability
of protection and its correlation with blocking/neutralizing antibodies and the number and function of CoV-specific
CD4+ and CD8+ TRM cells that reside in the lungs and brains will be determined. If successful, the lead universal
CoV vaccine that protects against most of the 5 VOCs could proceed quickly into an FDA Phase 1 clinical trial"
10818337,"Few interventions have proven to be successful in promoting medication adherence and impacting short- and
long-term posttransplant outcomes in adolescent heart transplant (HT) recipients. Improving adherence is a
persistent challenge with youth experiencing chronic health conditions, especially among adolescent transplant
recipients. Adolescent organ transplant recipients experience unique challenges remaining adherent to the
complex posttransplant regimen, with rates of nonadherence as high as 40% to 60%. In this population,
medication nonadherence remains a primary cause of late acute rejection (LAR) episodes, increased number
of hospitalizations, graft failure, and patient mortality. A mobile health application developed by emocha
Health Inc. facilitates asynchronous mobile video directly observed therapy (DOT) intervention,
empowering users to track dose-by-dose medication adherence. The intervention has been successfully
implemented with adolescent HT patients at University of Florida (UF) Health, wherein patients and their
caregivers reported high levels of intervention acceptability. In the proposed SBIR Direct to Phase II (R44)
project, we will examine several newly implemented technological and practical innovations within
emocha’s DOT app (and intervention). In this randomized controlled trial, we will assign adolescent HT
recipients to either the 12-week DOT intervention or to a control group involving enhanced goal-setting
sessions with transplant team members. Specifically, we seek to advance the DOT approach to allow for
greater patient engagement and interaction through novel video feedback and simplify delivery of the
intervention through centralized medication and dosing review at a single transplant center for the entire
study population: three pediatric HT centers representing a significant proportion of pediatric HT patients in the
state of Florida. Together with emocha, our small business partner, the proposed study will examine differences
in patient- and caregiver-reported measures, factors related to scalability and potential of translation of the
DOT intervention into routine clinical care, and long-term health and adherence patient outcomes. This study
will expand on recent results from pilot research using the emocha DOT intervention with adolescent HT
recipients. Implementing the DOT intervention with pediatric HT recipients with improved video feedback
capabilities and use of centralized adherence and participant monitoring are both programmatic innovations.
Our long-term goals are to provide evidence-based tools and support for pediatric HT recipients while
improving their medication-taking behaviors and to reduce barriers to delivery of DOT for pediatric solid organ
transplant teams. Such efforts are central to their care, the treatment efforts of transplant teams, and to the
research priorities of NHLBI."
10814138,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Maternally deposited factors control the earliest stages of animal development. When
maternal factors are depleted, the transcriptional responsibility shifts to the zygote. This process, known as
zygotic genome activation (ZGA), is conserved across animals and is necessary for accurate gene expression
and cellular differentiation. Maternal histone proteins are especially critical during early embryogenesis as their
levels regulate the timing of cellular/nuclear divisions: depletion of histones leads to cell cycle arrest, while
histone overexpression causes asynchronous cell division. Expression of the zygotic histones genes is activated
early, prior to ZGA. The histone genes are targeted by a suite of unique regulatory factors collectively called the
Histone Locus Body (HLB). However, it is unclear how the HLB components identify the locus as none directly
interact with DNA. Recent data suggest that zygotic histone genes are targeted by specialized transcription factor
called pioneer factors, which recognize nucleosome-obstructed binding sites. Pioneer factors facilitate overall
ZGA by recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes in preparation for other transcription factors. Pioneer factors
are therefore excellent candidates that may target the silent zygotic histone locus and prepare it fore HLB
formation and histone gene expression.
 My preliminary data suggest that the pioneer factor Zelda, the “master regulator” of ZGA, occupies the
Drosophila histone locus prior to zygotic histone gene expression. A histone gene array lacking Zelda binding
sites is less efficient at recruiting HLB factors needed for histone gene expression compared to a wild type array.
During ZGA, Zelda cooperates with another pioneering factor CLAMP. We previously discovered that CLAMP
participates in zygotic HLB formation and histone gene expression. In this proposal, I propose to leverage
powerful tools in Drosophila melanogaster to investigate the contribution of pioneer factors to histone gene
regulation during ZGA. I hypothesize that Zelda and CLAMP collaborate to prepare the zygotic histone locus for
HLB formation and organization.
 In Aim 1, I will determine the role of Zelda in zygotic HLB formation by leveraging a transgenic histone
array lacking Zelda binding sites, artificially tethering Zelda to the transgene at different developmental time
points around ZGA, and assaying HLB formation by microscopy. In Aim 2A, I will define the relationship of Zelda
and CLAMP at the zygotic histone locus by performing pioneer factor CUT&RUN at histone loci in the presence
and absence of the other pioneer factor. In Aim 2B, I will probe the role of pioneer factors in histone locus
organization through DamID and long-read sequencing. The long-term goal of this project is to define the
contribution of pioneer factors to regulation of the indispensable histone genes. The need for precise zygotic
histone regulation is broadly conserved, and insights from Drosophila will advance our understanding of
mechanisms that contribute to early human development."
10738776,"Sepsis is an aberrant immune response to infection1 with approximately one million cases/year in the
U.S.A. and an overall fatality rate of ~20-30%, increasing to ~40-50% in the case of septic shock1-3. Sepsis is
characterized by stress hyperglycemia4, mitochondrial dysfunction5, and persistent, strongly oxidizing
conditions. Although sepsis is a complex disease involving many different cells and tissues, a better
understanding of the role of macrophages (Mf) during sepsis may reveal new therapeutic targets. Mf exhibit
dynamic, stimulus-dependent functional plasticity in vitro and in vivo and critical changes to their activities
during sepsis are thought to be initiated by bacterial products (e.g., lipopolysaccharide; LPS) and
proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., interferon-g; IFN-g) that reprogram Mf to a highly proinflammatory, “classically
activated” or “M1” phenotyperev. in 6. These signaling pathways also stabilize the transcription factor Hypoxia-
Inducing Factor-1a (HIF-1a)7,8. HIF-1a is a master regulator of glycolytic genes9, facilitating a profound
“metabolic switch,” the “Warburg effect” rev. in 10-12, in M1 Mf in which glycolysis predominates and mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation is essentially absent, even when oxygen is present. We propose that this metabolic
dysregulation underlies inflammation during sepsis, by driving production of proinflammatory cytokines as well
as exposure of tissues to damaging M1 Mf-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS), proteases, and
bioactive lipids. While cytokines and ROS have been extensively studied, less is known about the role of
methylglyoxal (MG), a highly reactive, dicarbonyl byproduct that can accumulate intracellularly during the
glycolytic reaction mediated by triose phosphate isomerase (TPI)14,15. Significantly, elevated MG in sera of
septic shock patients has been identified as a biomarker that correlates with disease severity21. We have
reported that MG accumulates in M1 Mf upon stimulation with LPS and IFN-g in vitro, and results in the
formation of covalent “MG-adducts” with host proteins both in vitro and in the lungs of endotoxic mice17. Our
central hypothesis is that MG, a relatively short-lived, but highly reactive metabolite generated in response to
LPS+IFN-g activation of Mf, directs inflammatory M1 Mf differentiation in sepsis, and that strategies that inhibit
MG production or activity will prevent such differentiation, and thereby reduce Mf-directed inflammation. Our
scientific premise is that selective targeting of MG accumulation can be capitalized upon to mitigate sepsis-
associated tissue damage and death. We propose that LPS + IFN-g-induced stabilization of HIF-1a initiates
sepsis by promoting M1 Mf differentiation through increased glycolysis, MG accumulation, MG-mediated
glycation of mitochondrial proteins that disrupts mitochondrial function. Specific Aim 1 will characterize
mechanisms by which MG accumulation in Mf disrupts mitochondrial function, Aim 2 will examine the role of
metabolic signaling pathways on MG accumulation, and Aim 3 will test the therapeutic efficacy of MG-
degrading enzymes to mitigate endotoxicity and bacterial sepsis."
10832977,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is triggered by aberrant activation of oncogenes such as the mutant form
of RAS and acts as a key barrier to inhibit the progression of preneoplastic lesions. OIS is accompanied by
elevated DNA replication stress and activation of the DNA damage response (DDR); seminal studies have shown
that replication-associated DNA damage is a prerequisite for establishing OIS, where cells must be actively
replicating leading to a rise in replication stress that triggers DDR in response to oncogene-induced DNA hyper-
replication. Conversely, bypass of OIS allows the proliferation and oncogenic transformation of damaged cells
with genome instability. While these ideas underscore OIS as an anti-cancer barrier imposed by DNA damage
checkpoints, the precise nature of oncogenic stimuli that culminate in aberrant DNA replication and activation of
the DDR at stalled replication forks remains elusive. In addition, whether there exists distinct cellular signaling
cascade that relays upstream oncogenic signaling to a replication fork to cause DNA replication fork instability
is yet to be discovered. In this application, we propose to explicate the mechanisms that link oncogene-induced
replication stress to DNA replication fork integrity. Specifically, we reason that TIMELESS (TIM) in the fork
protection complex, an essential scaffold of the replisome necessary for replication fork progression and
checkpoint activation, is a key determinant of OIS. Our preliminary data indicate that OIS induced by RAS
activation is associated with downregulation of TIM that is linked to a novel posttranslational modification, i.e.
PARP1-dependent polyADP-ribosylation, of TIM and its proteolytic degradation. We hypothesize that failure to
protect stalled forks via suppression of TIM activity is an oncogene-induced mechanism that contributes to the
accumulation of replication stress and DNA fork instability. We will use HRASG12V as a model oncogene to induce
OIS in non-transformed human fibroblasts. In the first aim, we will identify the mechanism of HRASG12V-induced
OIS established by TIM downregulation and determine the role of TIM knockdown in triggering DNA replication
fork instability and senescence. I will also investigate whether TIM overexpression overcomes DNA replication
fork instability, and thus the onset of OIS. A variety of molecular and cellular techniques will be employed,
including DNA combing analysis of DNA replication fork resection, to evaluate the capacity of TIM-depleted cells
to prevent fork degradation in response to oncogene activation. In the second aim, we will identify the mechanism
of TIM downregulation during OIS, focusing on characterizing the polyADP-ribosylation and proteolytic
degradation of TIM triggered by the HRASG12V-driven signaling cascade. In the third aim, we will elucidate the
role of TIM in promoting tumorigenesis in the Kras-driven prostate cancer organoid model to define TIM as a
major player of early oncogenic events to breach the OIS barrier and promote transformation in the context of
RAS activation. Together, we expect to reveal a new mechanism underlying the onset of OIS, ultimately defining
TIM as a target of cancer therapy to induce senescence of cancer cells."
10827955,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Model-based learning affords individuals the ability to contemplate the specific outcomes of actions or events. This
facilitates flexible decision making. While we know of brain regions that contribute to model-based learning, the
wider pathways and circuits that facilitate development of these flexible representations in these regions are less
explored. Given that substance use disorders are characterized by deficits in model-based decision making, a gap
in the knowledge of the neural circuits contributing to model-based learning prevents us from making clinical
advances in the treatment of these deficits. The overarching goal of this proposal is, thus, to expose the neural
circuits that mediate model-based decision making.
 Recent evidence from our team and others has implicated ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons (VTADA)
as critical to driving model-based learning. This was surprising because phasic VTADA activity was typically
restricted to assigning general value to cues, which prevents this signal from contributing to more flexible
associative relationships characterizing model-based learning. This work acts as our catalyst to investigate how
this dopamine signal is used in the circuits necessary for model-based learning. We are particularly interested in
the dopamine pathways to the basolateral amygdala (VTADABLA) and lateral hypothalamus (VTADALH). We
have shown that BLA and LH are important for the development of model-based associations. However, while the
BLA and LH both contribute to model-based learning about cues proximal to rewards, the function of these regions
diverge when it comes to more distal predictors. Specifically, the BLA remains important for using distal predictors
to predict rewards, while the LH opposes learning about distal predictors. It is unknown how VTADA projections to
BLA or LH facilitate reinforcement learning generally, or model-based learning specifically. Thus, we hypothesize
that midbrain dopamine projections to the BLA and LH mediate the encoding of detailed model-based associative
memories that allow prioritization of information most relevant to rewards.
 Capitalizing on the overlapping and complementary expertise and perspectives from two labs, we will uncover
the function of these two non-canonical dopamine circuits in model-based learning. We will use a symmetrical and
multifaceted approach using modern cell-type and projection-specific manipulation and recording techniques in the
context of sophistical behavioral tasks to reveal the function VTADA projections to BLA and LH in proximal and distal
learning. We will use cell-type and projection-specific optogenetic inhibition, stimulation, and recording of the
VTADABLA and VTADALH pathways to expose the role of these pathways. We will use next-generation
dopamine sensors to provide novel measurements of dopamine release in BLA and LH. Finally, we
chemogenetically inhibit VTADA projections to BLA or LH while optically imaging BLA or LH neuronal activity to
elucidate the contribution of dopamine input to learning- and decision-related activity."
10834150,"Summary
Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and pharmacogenetics (PG) are leading causes of adverse drug events (ADEs),
with one in four patients experiencing ADEs attributable to DDIs or PG. However, despite the intrinsic
connection of their pharmacological mechanisms, DDI and PG are often studied separately. There is a
significant need for more efficient and effective translational from DDI to PG research, and newly developed
machine-learning (ML) and artificial-intelligence (AI) methods have made such research feasible. In our recent
DDI knowledge-discovery study of 25 million PubMed abstracts, we used ML and natural-language-processing
analyses for the first time to identify 986 DDI pairs with overlapping pharmacokinetic mechanisms and clinical
evidence, from which we generated 137 new PG hypotheses regarding CYP2D6 and CYP3A. In this grant
proposal, we will develop novel ML methods, including active learning that will allow human annotator
involvement and knowledge base reasoning that relies on logical rules to represent pharmacological
mechanisms. This proposal has three aims: (1) to develop an active-learning approach to perform DDI and PG
information retrieval analysis from the literature; (2) to develop a joint information-extraction and knowledge-
base-reasoning approach to perform DDI and PG information extraction analysis from the literature; and (3) (a)
to examine whether CYP3A/CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms are associated with omeprazole-induced
myopathy, and (b) to develop a prioritization scheme to examine new PG hypotheses generated from the
literature-based discovery analyses from Aims 1 and 2 using Vanderbilt University’s BioVU biobank. These PG
findings will provide a valuable resource for the wider scientific community for potential prospective studies and
contribute significantly to the improvement of precision medicine and clinical care."
10782490,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a severe, progressive disorder of aging caused by
“premutation” expansions (55-200 CGG repeats) of the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. Premutation
carriers with FXTAS show motor and cognitive declines resulting in loss of independence, reduced quality of
life, and premature death. FXTAS is more penetrant among male (>50% by age 60) than female premutation
carriers (16-20%), which likely is the major reason studies have focused primarily, if not exclusively, on males.
As a result, knowledge of key phenotypes and brain mechanisms associated with FXTAS in females is
severely limited. These knowledge gaps need to be addressed because A) FXTAS is highly impairing in
women and often clinically different than for men, and B) structural brain and genetic associations with clinical
outcomes vary across sexes in FXTAS, suggesting that sex-specific biomarkers are needed to understand
disease pathways and to support the development of targeted therapies. In the proposed R21, quantitative
motor, executive, and memory phenotypes implicated in our preliminary work on females with FXTAS will be
studied in females with FXTAS (FXTAS+), age-matched asymptomatic female premutation carriers (FXTAS-),
and age-matched healthy female controls. Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies
of motor, executive, and memory processes also are proposed; these represent the first known fMRI studies
focused solely on FXTAS in women. We also will test brain-behavior relationships with key genetic and
molecular targets, including CGG repeat length, allele repeat instability (AGG interruptions), and activation
ratio (ratio of cells with the normal FMR1 allele on the active X chromosome), which appears to critically
modulate the impact of the premutation allele on brain aging in females. Based on recent studies showing
overlapping molecular and cellular pathologies in FXTAS and Alzheimer's Disease, we also will conduct
exploratory analyses of the modifying effects of the ApoE and KLOTHO genes on risk for downstream motor
and cognitive impairments in female premutation carriers. These studies are the first step in advancing our
long-term goal of clarifying neurodegenerative mechanisms of FXTAS in women so that more sensitive, sex-
specific methods can be established to track disease progression and advance targeted therapeutics."
10812237,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Preterm birth (PTB; <37 weeks gestation) is the leading cause of infant mortality among Black infants.
Maternal chronological age has long been used to assess risk for PTB; however, chronological age
assumes that individuals age at similar rates and does not capture the inter-individual differences that
may exist due to race. Although both Black and White women have a maternal age-related increase in
PTB, the risk for PTB is higher among Black women than among White women at all maternal ages.
Geronimus’ weathering hypothesis describes a pattern in which age-related increases in PTB occur at
a younger age for Black women, and risk with age increases in a linear pattern, rather than the J-
shaped association with chronological age overall. This acceleration of aging has been attributed to
Black women being more likely to experience chronic stress due to social stressors of racial
discrimination and neighborhood disorder and crime. Epigenetic age, a measure of cellular or
biological aging, reflects influences of past exposures and may be more useful in determining risk for
PTB than chronological age, which is uniform regardless of life experiences. However, research is
lacking on (1) the association of social stressors with epigenetic aging among Black pregnant women;
and (2) the association of epigenetic aging with PTB among these women. This study is designed to
address the gaps in prior research and relies on our previous work demonstrating that ribosomal DNA
methylation (rDNAm) harbors the rDNA clock, a novel, sensitive, and evolutionarily conserved clock of
epigenetic aging. The goal of this study is to examine epigenetic aging as a marker of social stressors
and a biomarker indicating risk of PTB among Black women. Our cohort is comprised of 550 Black
pregnant women enrolled prior to the COVID-19 pandemic from the Detroit, MI and Columbus, OH
areas (R01 MD011575, PI Giurgescu). Women completed questionnaires and provided whole blood
samples and saliva during pregnancy, and these biological samples will be used to complete the
proposed study. Maternal medical records have been abstracted. We aim to: (Aim 1) Determine
whether social stressors are associated with an accelerated rDNAm clock among Black pregnant
women; (Aim 2) Determine whether women with PTB have an accelerated rDNAm clock compared
with women with term birth; and (Aim 3) Assess performance of the rDNAm clock associated with PTB
relative to alternative metrics of epigenetic aging. Epigenetic age, a biological reflection of inter-
individual variability in aging, holds significant potential as a useful parameter in PTB prevention from a
precision health perspective. Currently, the ability to predict PTB is poor, especially among Black
women. Precision health has the potential to identify individual women who are at risk for PTB, and to
identify therapeutic targets to prevent an individual from having PTB."
10755264,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Our microbiome plays a key role in colonization resistance, which is the prevention of growth, persistence, and
subsequent infection by pathogenic microorganisms. Disruptions in an established microbial community and its
functioning can alter infection susceptibility. Understanding how changes in the oral microbiome render it
vulnerable to pathogen colonization is essential, as carriage of drug-resistant microbes is a major risk factor for
developing serious and difficult-to-treat infections. One mechanism by which our microbiome acts to prevent
pathogen colonization is through the production of antimicrobial specialized metabolites (ASMs) that directly
inhibit the growth of competing microbes. Identification of such bioactive metabolites can be facilitated by
examining the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) that encode them. Analysis of reference genomes generated
through the Human Microbiome Project identified 3,118 BGCs across various body sites, with the typical oral
cavity containing high BGC abundance (1,061+/-143 clusters). The microbiota inhabiting this site represent a
first point of contact with the environment and invading microbes, and therefore, play a vital gatekeeping role
against pathogen dissemination to the lower gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. Yet, the structure and
function of ASMs produced by human-associated microbiota remains limited, particularly within the oral cavity.
This proposal seeks to leverage a combination of comparative metagenomic and metabolomic approaches to
determine the role of ASM production by oral-associated bacteria in defense against multidrug-resistant
organisms (MDRO). The specific aims are to 1) define differences in oral microbiomes between MDRO
carriers versus non-carriers and assess how determinants of health associate with abundance of key
taxa, and 2) evaluate the production of bioactive ASMs by oral-associated bacteria from MDRO carriers
versus non-carriers. These objectives will be accomplished through shotgun metagenomic sequencing of oral
microbiome samples from diverse populations, paired with analysis of detailed associated metadata relating to
health and MDRO carriage risk factors. Identification of antimicrobial metabolite producing bacteria will be
achieved through high-throughput bioactivity-guided fractionation, followed by metabolomic analysis and in vivo
efficacy testing. The study of ASM production by oral microbiota will yield insight into the factors shaping this
dynamic microbial community and serve as an untapped source for much-needed, new antimicrobial drug leads.
The unmatched caliber of microbiology research performed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison will provide
an ideal environment to carry out the proposed work. Resources and mentorship provided by project sponsor
Dr. Cameron Currie and collaborators will facilitate the timely completion of this proposal. Moreover, execution
of this tailored research training plan will enable the applicant to develop the necessary experimental,
communication, and clinical skills for a successful transition to a career as a physician-scientist."
10854728,"Project summary/Abstract
With the current opioid epidemic at a national crisis level, understanding the neural mechanisms governing
heroin use and relapse to drug seeking is key to discovering new treatment strategies. Exposure to stimuli
previously paired with the euphoric effects of heroin are thought to maintain habitual heroin use and seeking
behaviors. These heroin-conditioned effects therefore extend the negative consequences of drug use well past
cessation. Dysregulation of the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) is a driving factor in habitual heroin use
and cue-induced relapse, yet how discrete neural network components orchestrate heroin-seeking behavior
remains less clear. Using a novel head-fixed self-administration (SA) mouse behavioral paradigm and
simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging, recent data from our laboratory indicates unique excitatory neuronal
ensembles emerge and encode information related to heroin-conditioned cues and heroin-seeking behaviors.
Astrocytes are key regulatory elements in neuronal circuits and glial calcium events are necessary for modulating
neuronal network activity. However, how dmPFC astrocytes contribute to neuronal encoding of heroin-related
cues and heroin-seeking behaviors remains unknown. The goal of the current project is to investigate that
dmPFC astrocytes (1) are engaged throughout heroin use and (2) causally influence surrounding neuronal
ensemble dynamics and relapse behaviors. To this end, we will use a combination of contemporary strategies,
including in vivo two-photon imaging and chemogenetic tools, to measure and manipulate dmPFC cellular activity
during heroin use and relapse.
The current proposal will be the first to measure astrocytic calcium dynamics throughout habitual heroin use and
relapse and determine the causal influence of astrocytic activity on neuronal encoding and heroin-seeking
behavior. I propose to use a multi-virus approach and in vivo two-photon microscopy to visualize and track
individual astrocytic calcium events throughout heroin-SA, extinction, and reinstatement in head-fixed mice (Aim
1). Subsequently, I will employ two-photon imaging coupled with head-fixed heroin-SA to measure and track
neuronal activity with single-cell resolution. I will then stimulate an astrocyte-specific hM4D(Gi) designer receptor
during relapse and assess the consequence for neuronal ensemble activity and heroin-seeking behavior (Aim
2). Based on my preliminary data and published work of my mentorship team, I hypothesize that dmPFC
astrocytes display biased activation during the onset of heroin use and reinstatement of heroin seeking (Aim 1)
and that astrocytic calcium events directly coordinates surrounding neuronal network dynamics and relapse
behavior (Aim 2). These data would provide a wholistic view of how dmPFC network activity orchestrates
habitual heroin use and seeking behavior. The current proposal is the first to track astrocytic activity throughout
drug use and causally implicate glia in the neuronal encoding of drug-conditioned cues and relapse behavior."
10929294,"In this proposal we aim to build a platform technology for volumetric OCT snapshot imaging using principle of
Image Mapping Spectroscopy. We will demonstrate Full Field Spectral Domain OCT ((FFSDOCT)) system in free
space. The volumetric functional OCT will be enabled by leveraging advanced 2Photon Polymerization 3-D
printing approaches, that will permit printing of arbitrary optical quality structures. To achieve these goals, we
will utilize state of the art Quantum X system from Nanoscribe. The device allows the combination of small, and
medium size detail allowing feature sizes down to 140 nm. The roughness obtained in the printing process is
below 20 nm. Prints will be performed in clear resins (IV-Dip, SU8 analogs etc.). It also permits unprecedented
print volumes in comparison to other 2PP printers.
Specifically, the proof of concept Full Field Spectral Domain OCT will use custom designed 3-D printed
multifaceted mirror imaged and dispersed onto a 2-D sCMOS sensor. The mapping mirror will incorporate
10,000 miniature facets and 100 unique tilts to map 100x100 image points onto a camera sensor. In result the
system will operate as an array of parallel, high resolution spectrometers where the number of spectrometers
equals the number of object points. The resulting FFSDOCT system will have no moving parts yet be capable of
acquiring volumetric OCT images at the frame rate of the sensor (30 Hz). The imaging spectrometer will linearly
sample in wavenumber.
To evaluate system, we will perform series of imaging experiments in free space. FFSDOCT will be characterized
for resolution, system sensitivity, the measurement of flow and nanoscale vibrations."
10916184,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Next generation structural biology experiments look to move beyond static observations of structure to a
dynamic, time-resolved understanding of function. These next-level experiments are enabled by serial
crystallography at X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) and microfocus synchrotron beamlines but are limited by
issues of sample consumption. The long-term goal of this project is to democratize studies of protein structural
dynamics by developing robust fixed-target mounting strategies for light-, chemical-, and electrically-triggered
time-resolved protein crystallography experiments while maximizing sample utilization. This effort leverages the
expertise of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the BioCARS facility at the Advanced Photon Source
for testing and validation of new mounting strategies. These relationships will also enable rapid translation of
developed technologies to the larger structural biology community. We have four initial aims to do this:
Aim 1: Develop fixed-target strategies to facilitate the study of macromolecular crystallography targets
while maintaining biological activity. We will design and fabricate X-ray compatible sample holders that
maintain the stability of protein crystals over time while also allowing for easy sample loading, robotic handling,
and in situ spectroscopy. A particular focus will include enabling data collection in a fully anaerobic environment,
and the technologies developed here will serve as a basis for efforts in subsequent Aims.
Aim 2: Develop fixed-target platforms for photo-triggering of reactions for analysis via time-resolved
serial crystallography. We will develop X-ray compatible sample holders that take advantage of hydrodynamic
forces to create large-scale arrays of crystals for use in serial crystallography experiments. The polymer-based
fabrication strategy will enable fast, low-cost device fabrication, as well as allowing for direct imaging of samples,
in situ spectroscopy, and laser-based triggering of reactions for time-resolved X-ray crystallography studies.
Aim 3: Develop fixed-target platforms for chemical triggering of reactions for time-resolved serial
crystallography analysis. We will develop strategies to enable the controlled addition of a chemical species
(i.e., substrate, pH change) to enable the chemical triggering of reactions in crystals.
Aim 4: Utilize graphene-based devices to study structural dynamics based on high voltage triggering.
We will integrate graphene-based circuitry into our microfluidic devices to enable the use of a voltage-jump as
both a general strategy for triggering protein motions and to control electron transfer reactions.
The team is well qualified, merging expertise in microfluidics, X-ray science, and structural biology, with an
established history of developing new technology to address challenges within the structural biology community.
The impact will be improvements in the ability to perform time-resolved studies of protein structural dynamics
that will immediately enhance the research capabilities of a large base of NIH-supported and other researchers."

10813194,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 1
Maternal infection increases susceptibility of offspring to psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders,
including schizophrenia (SZ). Animal models of maternal immune activation (MIA) support this link, because
mid-gestational injection of poly(I:C) induces behavioral and neuropathological abnormalities in adult offspring
in domains similar to those affected in SZ. Thus, the poly(I:C) mouse model provides an opportunity to identify
the molecular and cellular underpinnings of susceptibility to MIA, which could lead to earlier diagnosis and
treatment of brain disease in humans. However, critical gaps in knowledge persist related to two of the most
important aspects of this risk factor for human disease: (i) most pregnancies are resilient to maternal infection
and (ii) susceptible pregnancies lead to multiple distinct disorders in offspring. We have recently discovered a
way to study both of these issues in the MIA mouse model. Results to date have revealed — for the first time
— an intrinsic factor, baseline immunoreactivity (BIR) of female mice before pregnancy, that, together with the
poly(I:C) dose used to induce MIA, predicts resilience as well susceptibility to neuropathology and aberrant
behaviors in offspring. These discoveries provide a unique opportunity to identify immune signatures before
and during pregnancy that underlie susceptibility and resilience to MIA, which can be used as biomarkers for
susceptible pregnancies. The central goal of this project is to identify the immune signaling pathways in
females before and during pregnancy that confer susceptibility or resilience to distinct subsets of MIA-induced
behavioral endophenotypes in offspring. We will address three specific aims: (i) identify immune biomarkers
and signaling pathways that underlie the range of BIR in female mice before pregnancy and that correlate with
susceptibility and resilience to MIA in offspring, (ii) identify how the progression of the maternal gestational
immune response in the mouse model dictates susceptibility or resilience to the effects of MIA in offspring, and
(iii) determine if BIR before pregnancy, and the maternal gestational immune response, correlate with
susceptibility or resilience to MIA in the non-human primate model. Project 1 directly addresses the central
hypothesis and all 3 aims of this Conte Center in a mechanistic manner by identifying immune signaling
pathways in females before and during pregnancy that confer susceptibility or resilience to distinct subsets of
MIA-induced neurodevelopmental and behavioral phenotypes in offspring. Results from this project are also
essential to the success of the other projects in the Center in revealing the immune signaling pathways that
drive susceptibility and resilience to sex-dependent changes in neural circuits (Projects 2, 4 and 5) and
neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes of offspring (Projects 2-5). Working closely with Project 2, we
will also test causality of two immune pathways for MIA-induced changes in striatal DA release and behaviors,
developing a pipeline for testing immune pathways (Projects 1, 4) across models (Projects 2, 3, and 5) for their
ability to ameliorate the effects of MIA, thereby enhancing the translational relevance of our Center."
10813197,"PROJECT SUMMARY- PROJECT 2
Maternal infection increases susceptibility of offspring to psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders,
including schizophrenia (SZ). Animal models of maternal immune activation (MIA) support this link, because
mid-gestational injection of poly(I:C) induces behavioral and neuropathological abnormalities in adult offspring
in domains similar to those affected in SZ. In particular, deficits in executive function, reward processing, and
dopaminergic (DA) input to striatal circuits are altered in SZ and in MIA offspring. Thus, the poly(I:C) mouse
model provides an opportunity to identify molecular targets in specific neural circuits related to SZ that could
lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment of brain disease in humans. However, critical gaps in knowledge persist
related to two of the most important aspects of this risk factor for human disease: (i) most pregnancies are
resilient to maternal infection and (ii) susceptible pregnancies lead to multiple distinct disorders in offspring. We
have recently discovered a way to study both of these issues in the MIA mouse model. Results to date have
revealed — for the first time — an intrinsic factor, baseline immunoreactivity (BIR) of female mice before
pregnancy, that, together with the poly(I:C) dose used to induce MIA, predicts resilience as well as
susceptibility to specific combinations of striatal-dependent behaviors and changes in immune proteins in the
striatum in offspring. The central goals of this project are to identify the changes in striatal circuits and immune
molecules in offspring and the changes in cytokine signaling in the dam that confer resilience or susceptibility
to specific combinations of MIA-induced behavioral outcomes. To that end, we will address three specific aims:
(i) characterize behavioral changes across multiple domains in male and female MIA offspring from susceptible
and resilient groups, defined by BIR of the dam before pregnancy; (ii) determine whether MIA alters striatal DA
release and how D1- and D2-specific pathways shape striatal-dependent behaviors in susceptible and resilient
male and female offspring; and (iii) determine whether the balance of pro-inflammatory and regulatory maternal
cytokines dictate susceptibility and resilience to MIA-induced changes in cortico-striatal-dependent behaviors,
DA release, and immune proteins in male and female offspring. Our project directly addresses the main Center
hypothesis, and all 3 Center aims, in a mechanistic manner by defining changes in cortico-striatal circuits that
underlie susceptibility and resilience to MIA and by comparing phenotypes between male and female offspring.
Results from this project will provide a phenotypic read-out for the maternal immune and the
neurodevelopmental molecular pathways identified in Projects 1 and 4, as well as circuit-based and behavioral
information in the mouse for comparison to nonhuman primate MIA offspring (Project 3), and in humans with
SZ, and for the computational framework that will bridge the species (Project 5). Ultimately, this project may
identify neural circuit components that can be targeted for interventions to prevent offspring from developing
circuit and behavioral abnormalities in regions and domains similar to those affected in humans with SZ."
10813201,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 3
Epidemiological studies have implicated maternal infection in the etiology of psychiatric and neurodevelopmen-
tal disorders, such as schizophrenia (SZ). Animal models of maternal immune activation (MIA) further support
the link by demonstrating that experimental activation of the maternal immune system induces changes in
offspring brain and behavioral development in domains relevant to human neurodevelopmental disease.
However, critical gaps in knowledge persist related to two of the most important aspects of this risk factor for
human disease: (i) most pregnancies are resilient to maternal infection and (ii) susceptible pregnancies lead to
multiple distinct disorders in offspring. We have recently extended the results of the rodent MIA model into a
species more closely related to humans – the rhesus monkey. Compared with rodents, nonhuman primate
(NHPs) are more similar to humans in placental structure and physiology, gestational timelines, brain develop-
ment, immune ontogeny, neuroanatomical organization, and behavioral complexity. The NHP thus provides a
translationally relevant model system to systematically examine issues related to MIA risk, resilience and
phenotypic heterogeneity. Results to date indicate that MIA-exposed male monkeys exhibit immune alterations
in the early postnatal period, followed by reductions in frontal grey matter as early as 6 months of age and sub-
tle impairments in social behavior and cognitive processing that emerge prior to 18 months of age. These early
developmental changes in MIA-exposed NHPs provide an opportunity to identify translationally relevant factors
that predict susceptibility or resilience to prenatal immune challenge, and to explore for the first time the impact
of MIA in female NHP offspring. In this project we will (i) quantify the acute maternal-placental-fetal response to
prenatal immune challenge and determine the relationship with subsequent changes in NHP neurobehavioral
development; (ii) determine the impact of MIA on species-typical social and cognitive developmental
milestones in male and female NHP offspring; and (iii) characterize long-lasting changes in dynamic cellular
immune function, peripheral inflammatory markers, and brain cytokines in NHP offspring. Our project directly
addresses the central hypothesis and all 3 aims of this Conte Center and leverages the unique features of the
NHP model to bridge the gap between rodent MIA models and patient populations. Results from this project
will provide unprecedented insight into MIA-induced changes in the primate maternal-placental-fetal
environment in collaboration with Project 1. Our comprehensive assessment of NHP behavior is translationally
aligned with Project 2 rodent studies and Project 5 human studies, resulting in an overarching computational
framework that will bridge the species. The same NHPs that undergo behavioral phenotyping will participate in
longitudinal neuroimaging (Project 5) followed by characterization of brain cytokines and changes in gene
expression (Project 4). If successful, our project will identify translational biomarkers to predict which pregnan-
cies are most vulnerable, thus providing a means to mitigate the deleterious effects of MIA during pregnancy."
10813204,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 4
Despite substantial advances in genetics, there is a lack of understanding of how environmental or fetal-
maternal factors influence neuropsychiatric disease susceptibility. Over the last 4 years we have shown that
maternal immune activation (MIA), a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders, results in long lasting
regional changes in gene expression in the brain of mice and non-human primates (NHP). One set of key
observations has been that variability in the maternal immune response, driven by baseline differences in
immunoreactivity (BIR), likely contributes to the variability in offspring outcomes. These observations provide
us with the opportunity to mechanistically connect maternal immune factors with subsequent resilience or sus-
ceptibility in changes in brain and behavior in offspring. By transcriptomic profiling of immune cells from the
mothers before and during pregnancy following MIA, as well as brain cells from MIA and control offspring, at
the bulk tissue and single cell level, this project provides a molecular and cellular framework for understanding
the basis for differential outcomes in offspring caused by MIA across species. Specifically, we will distinguish
how differential cortico-striatal gene expression relates to BIR before pregnancy and to changes in maternal
immune responses during MIA. First, in collaboration with Project 3 we will characterize changes in gene
expression in specific cell types in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum in NHP MIA off-
spring using bulk RNAseq and nucSeq to measure transcriptome changes in cortical neurons, striatal
neurons, and glial populations, including males and females (controls and MIA) from mothers with a compre-
hensive assessment of their immune response and fetal-placental development. Second, our team will
characterize and integrate the transcriptional signature caused by MIA to identify changes in gene ex-
pression in specific cell types in the PFC and striatum of susceptible and resilient mouse MIA offspring
characterized in Project 2. Third, these data will be combined with transcriptomic markers in blood from
susceptible and resilient female mice and NHPs before and during pregnancy from Project 1, to identify
changes in gene expression in specific immune cell types associated with MIA and variability in BIR. Fourth,
we will integrate molecular data with outcomes and maternal premorbid immune response to identify
biomarkers and mechanistic models of susceptibility and resilience in mothers and offspring We will
identify changes associated with maternal parameters including in blood immune cells (Aim 3), cytokine pro-
files (Project 1) and maternal sickness (Projects 2 and 3), and associate them with offspring response (brain
cytokines, behavior: Projects 1, 2, 3; imaging changes in humans: Project 5). These data will be used to inform
mechanistic models that link neuroimmune responses to molecular pathways and specific cellular responses,
to the emergence of altered brain structure and behavior. The single platform, cross-species design will enable
us to more definitively determine the relationship of these changes to neuropsychiatric disease in humans."
10813208,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 5
Evidence from epidemiology implicates gestational maternal immune activation (MIA) in the pathophysiology of
schizophrenia (SZ). These data, together with recent advances in our understanding of the role of immune
molecules in normal brain development, have led to the overarching hypothesis of this Conte Center: that early
activation of the maternal immune system alters brain development in offspring leading to structural
and functional changes in connectivity that are associated with the emergence of psychopathology in
adolescence and young adulthood. Our initial pilot studies of a unique nonhuman primate (NHP) MIA model
found evidence of altered social, repetitive, and self-injurious behaviors that emerged during adolescence and
were associated with increased striatal dopamine (DA). During the previous funding cycle, we found decreases
in frontal cortical volumes and increases in extracellular free water (FW), a putative measure of
neuroinflammation, measured using diffusion weighted MRI (DWI), in cingulate cortex gray matter (GM) in
male MIA NHPs. These changes in the developing NHP brain were present as early as 6 months postnatally,
prior to the emergence of any behavioral abnormalities, and highlight the importance of the postnatal period for
understanding the effects of MIA on brain development. In a parallel study in patients with SZ, we showed
increased GM FW, with maximal differences present in anterior cingulate, supporting the clinical relevance of
the NHP MIA model. In the present project, we propose to focus on the effects of MIA in the postnatal period
and on brain development in female NHPs, scanning both males and females at 6 and 18 months of age. To
obtain an integrated cross-species understanding of the effects of MIA and SZ on the development of cortico-
striatal functional circuitry, we will pursue the following three aims: (i) Longitudinal imaging studies of
phenotypic heterogeneity in MIA NHPs, (ii) Computational model–based analysis of frontal-striatal circuitry
associated with motivation and cognitive control in SZ, and (iii) Mechanisms underlying sex-related phenotypic
heterogeneity in SZ. Interpretation of the results of these imaging studies will be enhanced by tissue analyses
in the NHPs (Project 4) at age 18 months and measurement of the BIR and immunoreactivity of the mothers
(Project 1) of the offspring we plan to image. Finally, in addition to the above study in MIA NHPs, and in line
with our center’s expanded focus on MIA effects and of SZ on cortico-striatal circuitry, we will use a novel
computational model–based fMRI analysis to dissect the neural circuitry underlying motivation and cognitive
control deficits as well as their relationship to cortical FW and midbrain neuromelanin (NM), a novel proxy for
hyperdopaminergic activity in SZ. This computational model will allow cross-species comparisons of the role
for cortico-striatal circuitry in similar behavioral assays in the mouse MIA model and the MIA NHP. Finally, we
will also examine the role of sex in the phenotypic heterogeneity in humans with SZ at the neural systems level
and in relationship to symptoms and clinical outcomes."

contributing to the capabilities of the next generation of translational neuroscientists. Specifically, the
Biostatistics Core aims to: (i) Provide access for all Conte Center investigators to the appropriate level of
statistical support for the design, analysis, and interpretation of the results of their studies, (ii) Provide database
support for Conte Center investigators, including consultation on design and development of study-specific
REDCap databases and coordination of data sharing (e.g., group assignment and other relevant
characteristics) across projects, and (iii) Provide education and mentoring in the biostatistical skills necessary
to address Conte Center research goals, especially to junior faculty and trainees, through a combination of
formal mentoring and informal guidance. Our Biostatistics Core faculty have been deeply involved in the
development of the proposed projects and understand their objectives, the high levels of interdependency
among the projects, and the methodological challenges that must be addressed so that study variables and
knowledge developed in one project can be optimally incorporated into the design, analysis and interpretation
of related projects. In this renewal application, the Biostatistics Core is highly integrated with all components of
the Conte Center. Biostatistics Core personnel will interact directly with each of the five projects to support the
planning and analyses of both animal model system experiments and human studies, and in the integration of
the results of each individual Project across the Center to enable robust and rigorous testing of our Center

The Administrative Core (AC) supports the theme of the UNC Center for Environmental Health and Susceptibility
(UNC-CEHS): translating interdisciplinary research on environmental susceptibility to improve public
health in North Carolina. The AC provides leadership across several distinct areas, as detailed in our 5 aims.
First, the AC leads strategic planning in Environmental Cancer, Cardiopulmonary Disease, and Developmental
Disease (Aim 1). Second, the AC provides core infrastructure and research support to engage and support
environmental susceptibility research, including community engagement, molecular analysis, statistical support,
and access and support for human studies (Aim 2). Third, the AC supports recruitment and career development
of environmental health researchers (Aim 3). Fourth, the AC facilitates and disseminates research through
research reporting, engagement with community stakeholders, proposal development, publications, and
communication (Aim 4). Finally, the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill has a dynamic
environmental health sciences research community, and the AC supports the CEHS community by identifying
research resources and collaborators, providing administrative and scientific leadership, and facilitating fiscal
management (Aim 5). The leadership of the AC integrates expertise from different departments and Schools at
the University, providing a unified and multidisciplinary leadership perspective. Leaders come from the School
of Public Health and the School of Medicine and represent epidemiology, biostatistics, computational biology,
toxicology, environmental health sciences, genetics, clinical medicine, pathology, and analytical chemistry. Major
programmatic efforts include a formal Career Development Program, Facility Cores in Molecular Analysis and
Statistical Support (MASS), Integrated Health Sciences (IHSFC), and a Community Engagement Core (CEC).
Pilot projects are a major strategic initiative, including special targeted requests for applications (RFAs) for Team
Science and Single Investigators, a Rapid Response Seed program that is active continuously with a short
application-to-award time frame. The AC is guided in strategic planning by an External Advisory Board, an
Internal Advisory Committee, and a Stakeholder Advisory Board of community partners. The multi-directional
communication and administrative leadership provided by this core coordinates the CEHS research response to
North Carolina environmental health needs."

The Molecular Analysis and Statistical Support (MASS) core supports the theme of the UNC Center for
Environmental Health and Susceptibility (CEHS), translating interdisciplinary research on environmental
health susceptibility to improve public health in North Carolina. The MASS will provide comprehensive,
user-friendly, and efficient support for data acquisition, analysis, and interpretation needs of laboratory, clinical,
and population-based investigations in environmental health. The MASS will provide access and facilitate
utilization of a range of molecular cores and will integrate this support with rigorous and state-of-the-art
biostatistics and bioinformatics assistance in study design, data acquisition, and data analysis to support
translational research in the areas of Environmental Cancer, Cardiopulmonary Disease, and Developmental
Disease (Aim 1). The MASS will develop and implement new molecular and statistical methods to meet
investigators' analytic needs and to adapt to emerging data analysis strategies and unique data problems (Aim
2). The MASS will provide technical training, ranging from molecular methods to statistical, bioinformatics, and
data science, for junior investigators through seminars, workshops, and symposia tailored to the needs of CEHS
researchers (Aim 3). We collaborate with campus-wide efforts in genomics, exposure science, data science and
computational medicine to expand the influence and expertise of CEHS investigators and junior investigators.
Finally, the MASS subcores function collaboratively with the Integrated Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC)
to support existing research, novel pilot projects, community engagement, and grant applications (Aim 4). Major
program efforts and accomplishments during the past grant cycle include: updated infrastructure and
instrumentation to enable CEHS investigators to access state-of-the-art analytical and molecular technologies;
a new Method Development Award Program to support developing innovative new exposure science and
molecular methods for CEHS investigators; and novel state-of-the-art data analysis pipelines for CEHS
members. Faculty with expertise in molecular and quantitative methods development are available and serve as
collaborators on pilot projects and external grants. Our MASS facility core provides a scalable, high quality, full
service core facility to address data acquisition and analytic needs of our membership, from inception to

The Community Engagement Core (CEC) supports the theme of the UNC Center for Environmental Health and
Susceptibility (CEHS), translating interdisciplinary research on environmental health susceptibility to
improve public health in North Carolina. The work of the Community Engagement Core (CEC) in the UNC-
Chapel Hill Center for Environmental Health and Susceptibility (CEHS) is grounded in the Center's research foci,
and the CEC's reach extends broadly across the state and deeply into North Carolina's communities of public
health and education professionals. The CEC prioritizes partnering with public health professionals and
educators who engage our state's most vulnerable populations, such as minority and low-income populations,
because these populations tend to be more at-risk of the adverse health outcomes being studied in CEHS and
tend to have more serious health outcomes. The goal of the CEC is to enhance public understanding of
environmental health sciences research and foster environmental health literacy among public health
professionals and secondary science and health teachers, raising awareness of environmental health issues
and facilitating informed decision making that reduces harmful environmental exposures in homes and
communities. We accomplish this goal through four aims: (1) To foster dialogue among CEHS members and
community partners to inform development of environmental health sciences research that is responsive to
community concerns; (2) To enhance the capacity of public health practitioners to engage vulnerable populations
and other residents on locally relevant environmental health issues using a train-the-trainer approach; (3) To
enhance the capacity of secondary science and health educators to engage adolescents in meaningful and
socially contextualized education by facilitating incorporation of cutting-edge research into instruction; and (4)
To facilitate development of science communication skills among CEHS investigators and trainees. The CEC is
a vital element of the CEHS as it connects CEHS investigators with community partners, facilitating
multidirectional communication and ensuring broad relevance to the State, both of which are critical to
meeting the translational goals of the CEHS."

 The Pilot Projects Program (PPP) is a high-impact and strategic initiative of the Center for Environmental
Health and Susceptibility (CEHS). Its mission is to (1) cultivate innovative, transdisciplinary environmental health
research, (2) support junior investigators and incentivize experienced investigators in conducting environmental
health and susceptibility-related research, (3) integrate researchers with CEHS facility cores to support novel
investigations capable of generating advancements in environmental health research, and (4) provide
opportunities for research translation that impacts the health of North Carolinians. In consultation with the
Administrative Core and the Internal Advisory Committee, the PPP director coordinates, administers, tracks and
evaluates the program. The PPP has four phases: Pre-application, Application, Award Period, and Dissemination
& Evaluation. Within these phases, CEHS personnel and faculty leaders distribute the RFA, connect researchers
with core facilities, coordinate the scientific review of pilot applications, monitor active projects for progress and
budget expenditures, and connect researchers with the Community Engagement Core (CEC) for community-
level dissemination opportunities. The program includes three mechanisms: Team Science awards of $50,000
(2-3 per year); Single Investigator awards of up to $25,000 (3-5 per year); and, Rapid Response awards of up to
$15,000 per year (up to 6 per year). Pilot project applications undergo rigorous review, with an overall success
rate (in the previous 5 years) of 50% for Single Investigator awards and 35% for Team Science awards. A total
of 40 projects have resulted in 19 NIH grants (8 NIEHS), 2 National Science Foundation awards, and generating
extramural funding of $26.9 million in total, an overall return on investment of 33 to 1. In addition, 122 scientific
publications stemming from pilot projects were published in the first 4 years of this P30 cycle. Specific notable
achievements in this cycle include an NIEHS RIVER award (R35 ES028366), a new NIEHS Superfund Research

10889032,"Abstract
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease affecting approximately 1 million people in the
United States. Annual healthcare expenditure for UC is estimated to be more than $10 billion dollars, with most
of this cost being related to expensive biologic therapies. The two most prescribed biologics in UC are
vedolizumab and adalimumab, however, efficacy for these advanced therapies plateaus at approximately 30%.
Thus, there is an unmet need to understand drug specific mechanisms of treatment resistance. Our participant
level patient data and observations in murine colitis/colon injury models indicate that persistence of distinct
neutrophil subsets in the intra-epithelial space results in ongoing intestinal stem cell (ISC) injury, negatively
impacting the epithelial crypt microenvironment and treatment efficacy for biologics. Thus, proposed studies will
integrate clinical patient-focused and basic mechanism-focused studies to explore the idea that spatially distinct
neutrophil populations with unique genetic signatures and function may dictate mechanism specific therapeutic
response and impact mucosal injury resolution.
In the first Aim using spatially resolved single-cell and sub-cellular high-plex digital quantification of mRNA and
protein in already collected mucosal tissue from UC patients, we will profile neutrophils, T-cells, and intestinal
epithelium based on spatial orientation (crypts vs lamina propria) in UC patients. Using this approach, we will
identify gene/protein signatures predictive of response to vedolizumab therapy in UC and define targetable
mechanisms through which epithelial neutrophils interact with crypts and T-cells to mediate non-response to
vedolizumab. Second Aim will investigate how intra-epithelial neutrophil burden functionally impacts therapeutic
responses and resolution of colon injury in murine colitis. Specifically, using murine colon injury/colitis models,
clinically relevant therapeutics and neutrophil-specific genetic approaches, we will define molecular cues guiding
neutrophil retention in the intra-epithelial space and how this unique spatial localization impacts therapeutic
response to biologics (vedolizumab, adalimumab and tofacitinib). We will further determine whether intra-
epithelial neutrophils exacerbate colon injury and impede therapeutic efficacy of vedolizumab through enhanced
ISC loss.
As such, studies outlined in the current proposal will identify new mechanisms of therapeutic resistance to
biologics and identify molecular targets to optimize/improve responsiveness."
10878765,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inhalation of aerosolized dusts from urban, rural, and farming environments can trigger harmful airway
inflammation and injury; over time, continual exposure to these particulates increases one's risk for developing
inflammatory airway diseases. While dust exposures negatively impact lung health, factors contributing to
protection versus susceptibility to lung disease following these continual inhalational exposures are unclear. A
recently discovered class of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPM) derived from omega-3 fatty acids
regulate lung inflammation, immunity, and repair, and are likely key to the beneficial effects of diets high in
omega-3 fatty acids. Our previous investigations identified that the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA) and its lipid metabolite maresin-1 (MaR1) mitigate airway inflammation from acute and repetitive organic
dust exposure, mediated in part by macrophage activation and pro-repair activities on the airway epithelium.
Our exciting new data identify that omega-3 fatty acids and MaR1 can activate IL-22 signaling in lung
macrophages. IL-22 signaling promotes mucosal immunity and epithelial barrier integrity, and its activation in
the presence of these bioactive lipids may be key to their protective effects. Furthermore, our novel finding of
IL-22 signaling in macrophages challenges current dogma regarding the activation and regulation of this
pathway. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the role of omega-3 fatty acids in promoting pro-repair IL-22
signaling in the lung following dust exposures. We hypothesize that omega-3 fatty acids and SPM promote
lung recovery following particulate matter exposures by inducing alveolar macrophage IL-22 production that
subsequently promotes alveolar macrophage pro-resolution polarization and lung epithelial repair. To test this
hypothesis, in Aim 1, we will establish the impact of omega-3 fatty acids and IL-22 on lung recovery following
dust exposure. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the role of omega-3 fatty acids and IL-22 in epithelial repair and
mucosal immunity during dust exposure. In Aim 3, we will identify how SPM and IL-22 signaling impacts lung
macrophage polarization. Together, our studies will identify how omega-3 fatty acids modulate susceptibility
versus resilience to dust exposures, including a novel protective mechanism via activation of macrophage IL-
22 signaling to promote tissue repair and mucosal immunity. We expect our studies' findings to guide novel
treatment strategies for lung disease."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease resulting from a breakdown in immunological
tolerance caused by T cell-mediated destruction of islet beta cells. Diabetes is orchestrated by HLAII-
restricted CD4+ T cells, through cellular interactions with both B cells and CD8+ T cells, resulting in
autoantibody production and beta cell death, respectively. While anti-islet autoantibodies are currently
the best predictors of T1D development, screening is limited to four islet antigens and no T cell
biomarkers exist. Despite years of research, it is still unclear which antigen-specific CD4+ T cells
initiate T1D. New evidence suggests that hybrid peptides (HP) formed from the fusion of islet β cell
proteins may be critical antigens in T1D as recent studies identified HP-reactive CD4+ T cells from
T1D patients and diabetic mice in vitro. These neo-antigens escape central tolerance and must be
controlled by peripheral mechanisms including anergy or regulatory T cell control. In preliminary
studies, we identified HP-specific CD4+ T cells in diabetic mouse models using tetramer reagents,
and showed they are pathogenic and cause T1D in mouse transfer models. More importantly, we can
block spontaneous T1D in the NOD mouse model targeting one hybrid peptide when presented in
mouse MHCII using peptide-specific:MHCII blocking antibodies. Thus, we hypothesize that HPs are
critical antigens and that autoreactivity to HPs initiates T1D. The goals of this proposal are to
determine if HP-specific CD4+ T cells initiate T1D and if targeting them can lead to tolerance as a
prevention or cure for T1D. The second goal of the grant is to determine if HP specific cells are
relevant for human T1D and use of scRNA-seq analysis to uncover critical clues about shared
transcriptional programs related to the pathogenic potential between human and mouse HP reactive
T cells. Completion of this project could lead to better biomarkers to predict T1D risk and disease
progression."

The rapid adoption of mobile and interactive technologies by American families has outpaced research on their
potential effects on child development and health. Much prior research on television (TV) and older forms of
media relied upon parent recall of global constructs such as “screen time,” which may not be a complete
representation of family media use now that parents and children use mobile and interactive devices in an
intermittent, on-demand manner throughout the day. As highlighted at the 2018 NICHD scientific workshop on
Media Exposure and Early Child Development, the design affordances of mobile and interactive media differ
from TV in several important ways, and deserve novel scientific paradigms to describe how children and
families use media. The proposed project will fill these gaps in scientific knowledge by testing a conceptual
framework informed by human-computer interaction that examines how parent and child mobile media use
influence the development of child executive functioning (EF). We will examine mechanisms of these
associations, including changes in quality of parent-child interaction and frequency of EF-building activities,
and test whether effects are moderated by child sex and family psychosocial stress. The proposed research
comprises 2 studies. Study 1 involves semi-structured interviews with 40 parents from diverse backgrounds, to
explore parents’ conceptualizations of problematic design affordances and inform our measures for Study 2, a
longitudinal cohort study of 400 parent-toddler dyads followed yearly from age 2 to age 4. At each yearly home
visit, we will assess media use via surveys, mobile sampling, and app design coding, as well as standardized
video-recorded assessments of child executive functioning (EF) and parent-child interaction. In specific aim 1,
we will use structural equation models to examine bidirectional, longitudinal associations between parent
mobile media use (duration, frequency, and problematic design affordances) and child EF, testing both direct
pathways and mediation by quality of parent-child interaction and frequency of EF-building activities. In specific
aim 2, we will examine bidirectional longitudinal associations between child mobile media (use for regulatory
purposes, duration, and problematic design affordances) and EF, testing both direct pathways and mediation
by quality of parent-child interaction and frequency of EF-building activities. Finally, we will examine how child
sex and psychosocial stressors moderate associations between parent and child media use and EF. Our
findings will contribute to the evidence base upon which digital media guidelines are based, as well as digital
design approaches that reflect the needs of families with young children. In addition, our attention to modeling
bidirectional associations and articulating individual child, parent, and design affordance factors in the context
of early EF development will inform development of both precise behavioral interventions and
recommendations for population-level digital design and policy."
10841555,"This proposal builds upon our metabolomics expertise in untargeted and targeted metabolomics for the
generation of highly sensitive and quantitative targeted multiplex assays. The idea behind generating such
assays for radiation assessment and radiation injury in easily accessible biofluids (urine, blood, saliva) is to
rapidly determine the extent of exposure of an individual and distinguish between the worried well and the
exposed individuals that may require medical intervention. Highly quantitative approaches will be undertaken
through liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to quantify each already identified
radiation biomarkers in each biofluid. Such instruments are currently used routinely in clinical laboratories,
therefore maximizing the available resources for rapid evaluation of thousands of individuals during an
emergency. Based on criteria for sensitivity, high signal-to-noise ratio, low signal suppression from matrix
effects, and high fold changes compared to controls or relationships between pairs of metabolites,
biosignatures will be assembled and concentrations calculated. The combined biosignature will be developed
in a multiplex assay, effectively reducing the time between sample preparation to results. The goal is to
demonstrate that this multiplex assay method has the potential to be deployed in the case of an emergency to
a pre-determined network of clinical laboratories that can accept and rapidly process a high volume of
samples. While the ultimate goal will be for such a panel to be predictive in all cases, even a limited false
positive rate would facilitate assessment of radiation injury in a mass casualty scenario: e.g. a 1% false
positive rate would reduce the number of individuals needing further evaluation by 100-fold. Additionally, this
assay will be flexible as it could be enriched with biomarkers for specificity and radiation quality. This
application also combines the engineering experience and capabilities of our collaborators to further develop
pre-processing devices with the intention of stabilizing the sample during transport to a clinical facility. The
materials to be fabricated will also aim to enrich the biosignature for the radiation-related metabolites and
extract them effectively from small amounts of a biofluid (urine, serum, whole blood, saliva), transported as a
stable dry membrane. Assembly of such materials in a 96 well plate will further decrease the sample
preparation time and minimize human error associated with sample preparation. Our unique approach to
combine LC-MS/MS applications with pre-processing materials will aim to move this technology from the
feasibility stage to technology development, satisfying the needs for rapid methods for radiation injury
assessment.

10913299,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Diseases are frequently caused by dysfunction of proteins in the body, perhaps
due to maladapted genetics or from a wide variety of other causes. Researchers can gain
a glimpse into this function through the study of a protein’s mechanism and dynamics.
Ideally, a complete understanding of the role of a protein in biophysical interactions would
describe the entire mechanistic pathway on an atomistic and dynamic level. However,
this cannot be attained with experimental studies alone with today’s capabilities.
Computational studies can provide experimentally inaccessible quantitative and atomistic
information so they serve as powerful tools for better understanding diseases and
identifying targets for experimental follow-up and potential treatment, but they carry little
weight without rigorous experimental validation. We seek to reconcile experimental and
computational data, equipping researchers with a method to produce the aforementioned
continuous and atomistic information on protein dynamics so that they can elucidate the
long timescale dynamics of proteins on an atomic level. When deconvolving time-resolved
crystallographic data, I will substitute the typical static crystallographic initial inputs with
structures from molecular dynamics simulations and predictive models to improve the
continuity and accuracy of deconvoluted data. The objective of this work is to produce the
aforementioned ideal dynamics information for a significant portion of the mechanism of
PmHMGR as a demonstration and refinement of the proposed Markov State informed
Multilinear Singular Value Decomposition (MSiMSVD) method which reconciles
experimental and computational data. Application of the MSiMSVD method to slow
dynamical events, such as the PmHMGR 2nd hydride transfer, is limited by the ability of
molecular dynamics to perform accurate long-timescale simulations. This often requires
Transition State Force Fields (TSFFs), but their parameterization for biomolecules often
falls into local optimization minima due to high dimensionality. To reduce local minima
trapping and make TSFF generation more accessible for biophysical research, I will apply
constraints and swarm intelligence techniques to improve current TSFF parameterization.
 Collectively, these aims will provide a means by which experimental and
computational techniques can work synergistically to produce the continuous atomistic
protein dynamics information ideal for the investigation of proteins and their related
functions and diseases."

 Synaptic dysfunction is linked to numerous devastating neurological and psychiatric disease.
Synaptic transmission is initiated by the calcium dependent release of neurotransmitters. The calcium
sensors responsible for triggering vesicle release are the Synaptotagmins (SYT), a 17 protein family. The
function of one SYT, SYT7, is less well understood but is thought to be of significant importance due to its
broad expression throughout the body and brain, connections to cancer and ALS, and enigmatic function in
the central nervous system. Unlike other Synaptotagmins, SYT7 is thought to be found on the plasma
membrane and its function remains controversial. The role of SYT7 is still under intense debate due to
several outstanding questions regarding its cellular and synaptic localization. Answering these key questions
is the focus of my grant proposal and will provide necessary insights into SYT7’s function.
 This proposal aims to answer these questions by determining SYT7’s cellular and nanoscale
localization in cortical neurons using biochemistry and three-color STED super resolution microscopy. Aim
1 will determine whether SYT7 is found on the cell surface of cortical neurons using live-cell surface protein
biotinylation and live-cell surface staining in mouse cortical slices and rat primary cortical neurons. Aim 2
will determine how SYT7 is organized at synapses using three-color STED staining for endogenous synaptic
proteins. Aim 3 will determine whether neuronal activity regulates the cellular and nanoscale localization of
SYT7 using both surface protein biotinylation and live-cell surface staining with three-color STED.
 This proposal is designed to provide me with intellectual and technical training throughout the
fellowship award. I will learn key biochemical assays, ex vivo slice preparations, and will hone my skills in
advanced STED super resolution microscopy. With support from this award, the training during this
fellowship will provide me with the skills necessary to become a successful physician scientist."

Abstract
While virtual reality (VR)-based surgical simulation technology is being developed to improve laparoscopic
surgical training outside the operating room (OR), existing simulators focus mostly on technical skills (TS) of
hand-eye coordination for isolated tasks and seldom on non-technical skills (NTS) associated with both
cognitive skills of decision making, as well as interpersonal skills of communication, team-work and conflict
resolution. To enable VR-based surgical simulators to also train for cognitive skills, in the previous grant period
we successfully developed the next generation (Gen2) of laparoscopic surgical simulators that immerse the
trainee in a virtual OR using a head-mounted display (HMD) system, and introduce distractions, interruptions
and other stressors to capture the high-stress environment of the real OR. However, to the best of our
knowledge, there exists no VR-based simulator for training interpersonal skills needed for the
multidisciplinary integration of OR teams, which consist of surgeons, anesthesiologists, and
perioperative nurses. Following the significant reduction of adverse events in other disciplines, such as
aviation, by the introduction of mandatory simulation-based team training (e.g., crew resource
management), the National Surgical Skills Curriculum developed by the American College of Surgeons
(ACS) and Association of Program Directors in Surgery (APDS) has prescribed ten team-based training
modules to be performed in a simulation facility (e.g., an OR endosuite) with scenario-based training on high-
fidelity manikin simulators. However, such facility-based team training is extremely expensive and
cumbersome, requires dedicated facility and faculty time, and entails significant planning and schedule
coordination between trainees, technicians, and faculty. To overcome the challenges of facility-based OR
team training, the goal of this project is to extend the immersive VR technology (Gen2) developed as part
of our prior grant for a single user to the entire OR team, and harness recent advances in cloud computing,
mobile device-based VR and artificial intelligence and machine learning to design, develop and
evaluate a Virtual Operating Room Team Experience (VORTeX) simulation system. The VORTeX will allow
the OR team to train together in a distributed fashion (i.e., not co-located in the same room or simulation
facility) wearing mobile device-based HMD systems to develop further their NTS based on computer-generated
simulation scenarios replacing the physical ones. Evaluation of the simulation scenarios will be performed
asynchronously by a team of experts based on post-action replays. We will implement the VORTeX for a
laparoscopic cholecystectomy crisis scenario, developed and validated by our Co-I Dr. Dan Jones at BIDMC
and adopted as one of the team training modules of the ACS/APDS national surgical skills curriculum. We
hypothesize that the VORTeX will be at least as good as or better than traditional facility-based
simulation in providing non-technical skills training to OR teams."
10800676,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), causes 1.6 million deaths per
mated to be infected with Mtb. There is an urgent need
to develop new treatment approaches. In this project, we aim to investigate the role of the host non-coding
RNA (ncRNA) landscape in driving susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB) across two study sites in Africa (Cape
Town, South Africa and Kampala, Uganda). Focusing on human primary macrophages, we plan to integrate,
using systems biology approaches, genetic architecture with the coding and non-coding gene expression
landscape of response to Mtb infection. We will identify response expression quantitative trait loci (ReQTLs)
for coding genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and microRNAs (miRNAs) which will be integrated with
coding/non-coding gene expression, co-expression, and deregulation networks to prioritize key variants and
regulators orchestrating macrophage response to Mtb infection. The most promising miRNAs and lncRNAs
will be validated with orthogonal techniques and considered for functionalization in human macrophages.
Here, we will employ loss-of function approaches using antisense oligonucleotides in ex vivo Mtb-infected
human monocyte-derived macrophages to evaluate the outcome on intracellular mycobacterial growth and
investigation of mechanistic macrophage-specific anti-mycobacterial effector functions. Targeting these
identified host miRNAs and lncRNAs could become promising candidates for adjunctive host-directed drug
therapy for TB.
 Our central hypothesis is that a) Mtb hijacks host miRNAs and lncRNAs to establish successful
persistence and survival in macrophages, b) that human variation can affect key players and their roles, and
c) that an understanding of this can be leveraged to identify, design, implement, and test a novel RNA-based
anti-microbial treatment strategy. This hypothesis builds upon our previous unpublished and published data
[1] showing that Mtb targets miR-143, miR-365 and lincRNA-MIR99AHG in macrophages to promote
mycobacterial growth by fine-tuning expression levels of host genes and is supported by a growing number
of other studies [2-16]. Our long-term goal is to develop a host-directed drug system for antisense therapy,
specifically inhibiting miRNAs and lncRNAs that are crucially involved in TB pathogenesis. The rationale for
this approach would be to create a novel, targeted host-directed RNA-based drug therapy for TB. To achieve
this goal, we have assembled a team of experts in ncRNA biology, infectious disease, systems biology, and
bioinformatics from multiple sites in Southern Africa, Uganda and the USA."
10830277,"Emerging, preclinical, clinical, and human genetic studies raise the exciting possibility that selective
activators of the mGlu1 subtype of metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor have potential utility as a novel
approach for treatment for schizophrenia. However, until recently, tools were not available to allow studies of
the functional roles of mGlu1 in specific brain circuits. We have now developed highly selective mGlu1 positive
allosteric modulators (PAMs), along with genetic mouse lines that allow selective deletion of mGlu1 in specific
neuronal populations. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to establish the roles of mGlu1 in specific
brain circuits that are disrupted in schizophrenia patients. Interestingly, we recently found that highly selective
mGlu1 PAMs reduce striatal dopamine (DA) release and have robust efficacy in rodent models of antipsychotic
activity, such as reversal of amphetamine-induced hyper-locomotor activity and disruption of sensory motor
gating. Based on recent studies and our preliminary data, we postulate that activation of mGlu1 in a specific
population of spinal projection neurons that also express the D1-DA receptor (D1-SPNs) is responsible for the
ability of mGlu1 PAMs to inhibit DA release and to reverse behavioral effects of amphetamine that are relevant
for potential antipsychotic activity. However, it is possible that activation of mGlu1 in DA terminals or other
neuronal populations could be responsible for these effects on DA release and for the behavioral effects of
mGlu1 PAMs. Thus, we will perform a series of studies in specific aim 1 to rigorously evaluate the importance
of mGlu1 in D1-SPNs and other neuronal populations in the effects of mGlu1 PAMs on DA release and
associated behaviors. In addition to dysregulation of striatal DA release, multiple clinical and preclinical studies
suggest that loss of GABAergic inhibitory transmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and other forebrain
regions may play a critical role in the pathophysiological changes underlying cognitive deficits in schizophrenia
patients. Additionally, disinhibition is observed in humans and rodents in response to NMDA receptor blockade.
We now present exciting new preliminary data suggesting that activation of mGlu1 can increase activity of
somatostatin-expressing inhibitory interneurons (SST-INs) and parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons (PV-
INs) in the PFC, with an especially robust increase in excitability of SST-INs. In addition, our preliminary data
suggest that SST-INs in the PFC are critical for working memory, and led us to postulate that activation of
mGlu1 on SST-INs may improve working memory and reverse working memory deficits in rodent models. In
specific aim 2 we confirm our preliminary electrophysiology findings and rigorously test the hypothesis that
mGlu1 activation increases inhibitory transmission in the PFC by actions on SSN-INs. In specific aim 3, we
will test the hypothesis that activation of mGlu1 in SST-INs can reverse deficits in working memory and other
behavioral deficits observed in an NMDAR hypofunction model of cortical disinhibition. These studies could
provide new mechanistic insights into the therapeutic potential of mGlu1 PAMs for treatment of schizophrenia."
10800704,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this project is to identify molecular regulators enabling immune suppressive properties of
metastatic melanoma and define cell lineages that mediate therapeutic function of CD47 blocking antibodies.
Our central hypothesis is that metastasizing melanoma cells avoid immune recognition by hyperactivating
CD47 promoter through NRF1 transcription factor. Overexpression of CD47 then modulates tumor immune
microenvironment in a way that inhibits melanoma destruction and antigen presentation by professional
phagocytes while at the same time stimulating myeloid derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) that negatively affect
T-Cell responses. When the proposed research studies are completed we will accomplish identification and
characterization of potent molecular and cellular targets that regulate CD47 dependent escape of immune
surveillance by metastasizing melanoma cells. Delineating these factors will also serve a clinically predictive
value to allow patient selection based on their immune cell repertoire resulting in the prolonged curative
responses and increased survival. Clinical significance of the proposed studies is also highlighted by the fact
that we will be using immune- humanized PDX models to characterize our findings in the setting most
physiologically relevant to the patient disease."

The objective of this proposed program is to provide advanced training and skill development required for
future leaders in basic, clinical, and translational child health research to upper level undergraduate students,
grooming them to serve as the next generation of innovators in pediatric research. In line with the mission of
the NICHD, these young scholars will train with mentors dedicated to pioneering advances that ensure children
lead healthy and productive lives, free from disease or disability, from birth to adulthood. The proposed
research education program is designed to expand and supplement a 10-week summer pediatric research
internship at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) – the CHOP Research Institute Summer Scholars
Program (CRISSP) - with the ultimate goal of creating uniquely qualified students who are primed to both
succeed in and foster the biomedical research workforce pipeline. The program, which provides mentored
research training to 25 competitively-chosen student interns annually, will achieve this goal by expanding
curriculum in four key elements. These include technique mastery, exploration of career trajectories,
mentorship training and pipeline-building focused on diversity recruitment. In addition to enhanced student
training, a formal support for junior faculty will be developed to provide them with advanced mentorship training
and skills, enhancing both their support of the CRISSP scholars and their ability to skillfully support other
current and future mentees. These proposed enhancements, unique to the CHOP summer internship

Preclinical work has also indicated that the cerebellum has many nonmotor functions ranging from aggression to sleep. Expression of autism related proteins within cerebellar principle neurons (Purkinje cells) is sufficient to recapitulate many hallmarks of the condition in mice. These Purkinje cells send their projections to the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and vestibular nuclei (VN), often considered the only cerebellar output nuclei. However, the known output pathways that connect the cerebellum with the forebrain seem insufficient to explain the diversity of behaviors now associated with it. We found that there is an additional, underappreciated output pathway through the parabrachial nucleus that receives direct Purkinje cell input and projects to the forebrain. Unlike the conventional cerebellar outputs, this pathway has significant projections to the amygdala, basal forebrain, prefrontal cortex and others. The aim of this project is to characterize cerebellar inputs to the parabrachial and identify these novel cerebellar output targets. We will focus on the projection to the amygdala. There is a rich behavioral literature describing the cerebellum as a core component in fear extinction, though there is no known neural substrate underlying this. In humans, trauma to the cerebellum is a strong predictor of post- traumatic stress disorder. We will test whether this unconventional cerebellar output can potentially mediate this nonmotor behavior."

The MARC Program at Hunter College aims to increase the number of students from underrepresented (UR)
groups in biomedical and behavioral research who enter and successfully complete PhD programs. Hunter
College is a large public institution with an incredibly diverse student body, a large proportion of which is
striving to overcome a variety of challenging socio-economic disadvantages. Our long-term goal is to
increase the commitment of underrepresented students to careers in biomedical research, and to prepare
them for successful entry into and completion of highly competitive PhD programs. We propose to utilize the
strength and diversity of the Hunter College scientific research laboratories and academic programs to create
an effective and supportive training and research environment for MARC scholars. The objective of this
proposal is to provide interventions for UR undergraduates pursuing degrees in fields comprising the
biomedical sciences and enhance their ability to have successful research careers and effectively
communicate and work with multidisciplinary teams. Our rationale for this project is that successful completion
of the proposed program will convey to students the technical and professional skills necessary to earn a PhD
degree and excel as a biomedical researcher. Our programming will utilize the routes to building scientific self-
efficacy and resilience among our MARC students. We will collaborate with the Hunter College’s Skirball
Science Learning Center to provide academic support for UR students. We expect to accomplish our objective
by pursuing the following three specific aims: (1) Create a robust MARC admissions pool, by leveraging Hunter
College student engagement practices to identify and nurture interested freshman and sophomores. We will
target students interested in scientific research for interventions that will increase the number of them who
meet the course and GPA requirements for MARC admission, and cultivate their desire to pursue a career in
scientific research. (2) Deliver high-quality student training, focusing on skills needed for successful STEM
research, by providing MARC scholars with appropriate training opportunities at Hunter and other institutions.
(3) Provide students with resilience training, academic support, and professional development by helping
students hone the necessary skills and drive required to excel in their courses, develop strong self-
identification as a scientist, and to thrive as a graduate student. Together, this will increase the number of
Hunter College graduates (MARC and non-MARC) pursuing and completing a PhD in biomedical sciences.
We will set a benchmark of at least 75% matriculating into STEM PhD programs after participation in the
MARC Program, with 80% of those successfully advancing to candidacy in their PhD programs. Progress will
be monitored via trainees’ individualized development plans and program evaluation efforts in collaboration
with Hunter College’s Office of Assessment."

The objective of the proposed research is to improve pediatric medication safety in the electronic health record
(EHR) through optimization, deployment, and testing of an assessment tool designed to identify pediatric weight-
based dosing errors. The self-evaluation tool is designed for use by any healthcare provider organization,
regardless of usability expertise or informatics resources. In Aim 1, we will optimize an existing pediatric
medication safety evaluation tool for the EHR by engaging with subject matter experts in pediatrics, medication
safety, tool development, and informatics; this tool was developed through funding from the Pennsylvania Patient
Safety Authority. We will use the evidence-based implementation framework of Reach Effectiveness Adoption
Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) to deploy and test the tool. In Aim 2, we will deploy the tool for testing in
at least twenty different healthcare provider organizations that will be purposefully selected to ensure diversity
in geographical location, patient population, and EHR vendor. In Aim 3, we will compare pediatric medication
errors between sites that are able to make changes in the EHR to address items flagged as deficient on the
assessment tool vs. those that are unable to make the changes.
The research effort is a unique collaboration between MedStar Health's National Center for Human Factors in
Healthcare and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta/Emory University. This project utilizes the collective expertise
of the diverse research team which includes human factors engineering, pediatric medication safety, health
information technology, usability, and patient safety. The research team has extensive experience developing
assessment tools, disseminating these tools for widespread use, and identifying important areas for technology
and safety improvement.
At the end of this project, we will have developed a tool with accompanying test cases to assess EHR safety for
pediatric weight-based dosing errors. In addition, we will also identify barriers and facilitators to tool use across
settings with varying levels of resource availability. Finally, we will develop recommendations on how to
customize the tool to enable assessment across diverse healthcare settings that have varying levels of resources
available for improving patient safety and quality."

 The public health burden of mood disorders, such as depression, anxiety, and apathy, among people with
HIV (PWH) remains high, despite control of the virus. Neuropsychiatric disorders or symptoms (NPS), afflict 30-
60% of PWH and have risen in prevalence, owing to increased longevity in the combination antiretroviral therapy
era. Furthermore, mood disorders and cognitive impairment frequently co-occur in PWH, are often treatment-
resistant, and present substantial challenges to clinical care overall, due to adverse impacts on adherence to
treatment, quality of life, and functional status. However, the causative mechanisms underlying NPS in virally
suppressed (VS) PWH, and new therapeutic targets, remain elusive.
 Mood disorders in people without HIV are known to involve altered iron metabolism, and our preliminary
studies implicate iron imbalances in cognitive impairment and depression in PWH. Iron is essential for
neurotransmitter balance, synthesis and maintenance of myelin by oligodendrocytes, and energy metabolism in
the brain. Iron regulation is disrupted by HIV infection, neuro-inflammation, and a leaky blood-brain barrier (BBB).
It is unknown, however, whether HIV-related changes in iron transport influence brain iron accumulation, which
is linked to many cognitive disorders. Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping magnetic resonance imaging
(QSM/MRI) is a powerful, state-of-the-art neuroimaging technique which can address this research gap by
providing the means to quantify regional brain iron deposition (or load). Specifically, we will 1) Determine
alterations in regional brain iron load in VS-PWH versus HIV-negative individuals, and the contribution of these
alterations to reward and cognitive processes, and 2) Determine the contributions of brain iron, oligodendrocyte
iron-delivery proteins, and altered myelin and dopamine/serotonin homeostasis to disrupted reward and cognitive
processes in VS-PWH versus HIV-negative individuals. The project will employ existing QSM data and
behavioral metrics in RDoC cognitive systems from participants in an ongoing NIH-funded study, to which we
will add behavioral measures in reward processing and biomarkers of iron delivery, myelin maintenance and
mono-amines relevant to frontostriatal function. We will test the central hypotheses that higher brain iron load
in frontostriatal regions will significantly contribute to changes in reward as well as cognitive processes, which
are strongly reliant on prefrontal regions (cognitive control, working memory, attention) in PWH. Findings from
this study will provide the basis for future in-depth mechanistic investigations of mood disorders in VS-PWH and
suggest potential therapeutic targets."

 The growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), formerly known as macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1),
is a cytokine that shows expression and serum rise in response to many conditions and diseases, including
pregnancy, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. GDF15 signaling has gained significant attention in recent years with
multiple papers in 2017 identifying the GDNF family receptor α-like ( GFRAL ) receptor as binding GDF15
selectivelyand with high affinity. However, the reported restrictive expression of the GFRAL receptor to the
area postrema (AP) and nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) of the brainstem, areas highly critical to both energy
balance and emesis/nausea/malaise suggests that GDF15-GFRAL signaling could be an important factor not only
in long-term body weight regulation, but also in short-term processing of emesis and illness. Behavior. Thus,
understanding what role GDF15-GFRAL signaling plays in illness behavior and anorexia is paramount to
determining the mechanism of GDF15 action. Compelling evidence links GDF15 signaling with chemotherapy-
induced nausea and anorexia, which remain important clinical problems despite relatively well-controlled
chemotherapy-induced emesis, by showing that: 1) GDF15 signaling causes nausea and emesis; 2) an AP/NTS
site of action is responsible for mediating the feeding effects of GDF15 signaling through binding of the GFRAL-
RET receptor complex, and 3) obesity, cancer, and chemotherapy increase circulating GDF15 in rodents and
humans. We hypothesize that a functional dynamic change in the expression of central GDF15 levels in the NTS
and AP will occur following energy balance dysregulation and/or administration of emetic stimuli, and that we
can mitigate/treat such through the unique molecular and behavioral assays and patented peptide-based
technology employed here (i.e. our
peptide-based
inhibitor
bind
nausea
novel GFRAL-RET antagonist “GRASP”). The GRASP antagonist is a small,
sequence with our in vivo and conformational binding models supporting it to be an allosteric
to the GFRAL-RET complex. We have also shown that GRASP can penetrate into the brainstem and
to GFRAL-expressing neurons in the AP/NTS, and consequently attenuate GDF15- and cisplatin-induced
behaviors in rats.To further explore the GDF15-GFRAL system, we propose complimentary studies by a
multi-PI team of established investigators with extensive collaborative experience to investigate the following
aims: Aim I will characterize brainstem circuitry and unbiased single cell transcriptomics for endogenous GDF15
production and GFRAL/RET-expressing neuronal phenotypes. Aim II will characterize GDF15-induced emesis,
nausea behavior, and anorexia as well as characterize the GRASP lead compound against these behaviors with a
multi-species approach. Aim III will characterize the critical mechanistic and stability parameters of GRASP
through rational design of analogs based on functional, computational and structural data to build upon our
successful technology to-date that seeks to block the GFRAL receptor to treat sickness measures that include
unwanted anorexia, nausea and emesis."

Our research approach is to identify and characterize signaling mechanisms in specialized cell types as a means
to understand mechanistic underpinnings of various physiological systems. This proposal leverages two
uniquely-suited model systems to ask how cells detect and discriminate diverse environmental signals:
1) Sharks and skates detect and discriminate incredibly weak and specific electric fields using specialized
electroreceptor cells. By exploiting this unique model system, we will ask how cells are molecularly tuned to filter
and select among the subtle differences that specify the most salient environmental signals. Indeed, these fishes
discriminate between small bioelectric signals, such as those from prey or mates, based on their physiological
state. Furthermore, related modulatory hormones can regulate signal detection. Our recent studies have
provided insight regarding the molecular basis of electroreception and suggest that specific ion channel
properties contribute how incoming signals are filtered. Here, will we investigate how electroreceptor protein and
cellular properties are modulated by physiological state to affect cellular signal transduction. We will use genetic
profiling, electrophysiological, and expression cloning methods to probe hormone-induced cellular signaling
cascades and their contribution to cellular electrical tuning. We will then leverage these defined signaling
cascades to ask whether in vivo modulation of cellular tuning determines frequency selectivity in behaving
animals. This approach will reveal how integrative cellular tuning contributes to signal discrimination.
2) In a second project, we will probe mechanisms of signal filtering in octopus arms, which are used as flexible
sentinels that allow these animals to explore their surroundings at a distance by using a unique contact-
dependent form of ‘taste by touch’ chemosensation. Furthermore, octopus arms are capable of processing this
multimodal sensory information, independent of the centralized brain, to produce sophisticated behaviors. Our
studies will use single-cell genetic profiling, physiological, protein structure-function, and natural product
chemistry approaches to identify sensory receptors and their properties, signal transduction cascades, and
intrinsic electrical properties used by specialized cells within arms that facilitate sensation. We will then
independently or simultaneously activate these receptors and signaling cascades to ask how individual receptor
proteins integrate information to produce specific cellular responses and organismal behaviors. This approach
will allow us to determine how single cells detect and transduce multiple stimuli as distinct cellular outputs to
govern organismal function.
These integrative studies span multiple specialized cell types, tissues, and organisms to increase our
understanding of the basic cell biology underlying signal transduction."

skills to carry out cutting-edge alcohol research. For the past 35 years, the Alcohol Research Training Program
at MUSC has created an environment where basic scientists and clinicians work together to train the next
generation of alcohol researchers. The objectives of this training program are to: 1) integrate trainees into funded
alcohol research programs with appropriate mentors, 2) provide a strong foundation in research design,
analytical techniques and data presentation relevant for AUD research, 3) provide trainees with exposure to
appropriate role models and opportunities for mentoring, 4) provide instruction in issues related to scientific
ethics, and methods for enhancing rigor and reproducibility of scientific results, 5) enhance communication skills,
6) teach trainees how to prepare a research focused grant application needed to transition to an individual
training award, 7) help each fellow gain an appreciation of both clinical and basic science research to enhance
their understanding of how their training relates to health and disease, and 8) assist trainees in professional
development and career advancement. Over the past decade, there has been outstanding growth and success
of faculty devoted to alcohol research that has contributed to MUSC’s stature as a center for alcohol and
substance-use research. This has generated a high demand for predoctoral and postdoctoral training in alcohol
research. Thus, this application requests funds to continue this valuable program. Support is requested for four
post-doctoral trainees and four pre-doctoral trainees. Seven major research areas are available for training: 1)
elucidating brain targets of alcohol action, 2) uncovering the neurobiological basis of excessive drinking, 3)
advanced brain imaging and stimulation techniques in human AUD subjects, 4) determining the cognitive aspects
of alcohol use and dependence, 5) evaluating novel pharmacotherapies for treating AUD, 6) analyzing how
genetic polymorphisms contribute to alcohol use and treatment efficacy, and 7) studying how stress and trauma
contribute to alcohol use and dependence. Training will take place within a tightly integrated and physically
connected environment where educational and research opportunities are closely coordinated. The
comprehensive training program incorporates didactic material, clinical experiences and research opportunities.
Recruitment and selection of trainees is accomplished by the Program Directors and Executive Committee
members and by partnering with the College of Graduate Studies and Postdoctoral Affairs Office of MUSC who
provide assistance in recruitment of under-represented individuals. Mentors are faculty with actively funded
alcohol research projects and matching of trainees with mentors is by mutual consent. The NIAAA training
program has been successful in placing trainees in highly-productive postdoctoral and faculty-level positions
through which they continue to contribute to alcohol research."
10843217,"Regulatory clearance of the Glide Control Strategy for Upper Limb Prostheses
ABSTRACT
There is a pressing need to improve control of myoelectric prostheses for individuals with upper limb loss (ULL).
To date, only two fundamental control methods have been made commercially available – Direct Control (DC,
introduced in 1960) and Pattern Recognition (PR, introduced in 2016). Both have significant limitations, as
outlined within the proposal.
Thus, we propose a new control method called Glide. The Glide architecture does not use ‘triggers’ to switch
between different grasps like DC systems, nor does it require frequent ‘recalibration’ like PR systems. Instead,
it combines the simplicity of DC with the functionality of PR. It is based on effecting joystick-style motions of the
residual limb to move a “Glide cursor” to specific locations within a circular region called the “Glide domain.” The
Glide cursor position is determined by the resultant of the vector summation of two to eight EMG channels
(depending on individual patient’s needs), where each of the electrode channels are spaced at equal angular
distances apart from each other on the Glide domain.
To date, we have 1) developed the controller hardware; 2) iteratively developed the control strategy and user
interface with direct involvement of clinicians and individuals with ULL; and 3) evaluated a total of nine individuals
with trans-radial ULL including seven who completed long-term in-home testing. Of note, our experience now
includes one individual who has been using the system for two and half years and counting.
We now propose to commercialize the novel Glide control strategy and enable accessibility to the widest group
of patients possible. We propose two aims to accomplish these goals. The first aim is a regulatory aim, where
we will complete the Verification and Validation of the system and submit a 510(k) for regulatory approval. The
second aim is a scientific aim, where we will evaluate the hypothesis that use of Glide results in improved
functional, satisfaction and usage metrics as compared to use of a standard DC prosthesis. An important benefit
of this aim, presuming the results are favorable, is that it will provide strong support for reimbursement.
If we are successful, we will have met our dual mandate – to improve usability of upper limb prostheses, while
simultaneously increasing real-world access to advanced prosthetic technologies."
10792613,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most devastating dementia causing severe global concern. Although the
mechanism of AD pathogenesis is still under debate, it is widely accepted that aggregated fibrillar forms of Aβ
peptides are prominent hallmarks and the major cause of AD due to their toxicity to neurons. Therefore, Aβ
aggregates are the potential targets for the intervention of AD, as targeting and removal of Aβ fibrils or plaques
is expected to eliminate the neuronal toxicity of Aβ aggregates. However, eradication of total Aβ peptides by
antibodies such as the new drug aducanumab could lead to severe side effects, whereas anti-Aβ aggregation
by β-sheet mimetics could only prevent or delay the process of aggregation process and could not disrupt the
formed/existing Aβ aggregation. Therefore, development of more effective molecular probes that not only prevent
but also disrupt Aβ fibril formation is still in an urgent need.
 In contrast to the use of β-sheet mimetics to block Aβ fibrillar growth, recently we designed a series of helical
peptidomimetics that can tightly bind and stabilize monomeric helical Aβ and thereby shifting the equilibrium of
Aβ conformation into off-pathway structure, leading to both potent prevention and disruption of Aβ aggregation,
as well as significant enhancement of neuro cell growth and dendrite branching without virtually any cytotoxicity.
Furthermore, this lead compound could remove Aβ plague deposited in the brain of the AD transgenic mouse
and completely recover the memory of mice in the behavior test. As such, our long-term goal is to develop
novel biomaterials that can prevent, halt and cure AD. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step to
achieve the long-term goal, is to advance our preliminary work by rationally designing structurally related
analogues of the current lead, so as to identify and develop more potent and effective compounds that can tightly
bind and stabilize Aβ monomer and thus prevent and disrupt Aβ aggregation both in vitro and in vivo. We will
first design helical peptidic foldamer bearing diverse functional groups and closely mimic the binding pattern of
our lead compound. Then we will use our established in vitro assays such as 2D-NMR and kinetic binding assays
to identify and optimize our designed compounds that target and inhibit the aggregation of Aβ peptides. The
compounds with activity equivalent or better than the lead compound will be used to study their ability to inhibit
Aβ aggregation both in vitro and in vivo in AD-transgenic mice.
 The proposed study is significant because there is no effective therapeutic strategy for AD diagnosis and
prevention. Our research will provide molecules with novel mechanism to unravel AD pathogenies and to develop
potential molecular probes and therapeutic agents for cure of AD. The proposed research is innovative because
we not only provide a new strategy for the development of novel class of foldameric prevent and disrupt Aβ
aggregation, in addition, this approach of rational design for the recognition of Aβ surface can be easily extended
to identify new materials targeting other amyloid diseases such as Huntington’s disease and diabetes diseases."

Renal cell carcinomas (RCC) are among the 10 most common cancer types in man (6th) and woman (8th)
worldwide. Most RCC are clear cell carcinomas (>80%) that represent an atypical cancer type in many ways
including the intrinsic resistance to many chemotherapeutics, sensitivity to anti-neoangiogenesis, and sensitivity
to immune checkpoint inhibitors but with very low mutational burden. The treatment landscape of RCC has been
changing rapidly in the last couple of years but still with very low complete response rate even with the most
updated treatment regimens. Those “atypical” features of RCC prompted us to perform a comprehensive single
cell RNA sequencing for human ccRCCs and paired bloods. We found that tumor induced Tregs are highly
suppressive to effector T cells and could be the major immune cells conferring the immune suppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME). These TI-Tregs have the typical signs of cellular senescence, including the expression
of p16, p21, BCL-XL, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and the activation of β-galactosidase
(β-Gal). The group recently reported the development of the first-in-class BCL-XL degraders, i.e. the Proteolysis
Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs, referred to as BCL-XL-Ps). DT2216, a lead BCL-XL-P, targets BCL-XL to the
von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase; and PZ15227 targets BCL-XL to the cereblon (CRBN) E3 ligase for
ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. We have found these two senolytics are very
effective in eliminating TI-Tregs and activate anti-tumor immunity in our recent publication. Based on these novel
findings, we hypothesize that aging- and cancer-associated cellular senescence – including senescence from
immune cells – is critical in RCC pathogenesis and cancer progression via modulating the tumor immune
microenvironment. Understanding these fundamental questions is important for rational design of therapeutic
regimens towards to RCC that remains an urgent and unmet clinical need. Specific Aim 1 is to establish the
mechanistic connection between cellular senescence – in particular Treg senescence – and RCC with special
focus on the modulation of tumor immune microenvironment. Aim 2 is to determine the therapeutic efficacy of
senolytic depletion of TI-Tregs and common therapeutics in RCC. The team has expertise in clinical renal cancer,
cellular senescence, in particular the senolytic drug development and senescence tracing, cancer models and
cancer immunology. We will establish the role of tumor infiltrating Tregs in immune modulation within the tumor
microenvironment and determine the efficacy of targeting senescent Tregs in RCC cancer therapy, by combining
with anti-neoangiogenesis drugs or immune checkpoint inhibitors."

How can we promote health and survival during infection? Clinically, most patients are treated with drugs that
work to eliminate the pathogen: antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, etc., but this approach is often insufficient.
The primary determinant of survival during infection is the host’s ability to prevent, withstand, or repair damage.
Thus, eliminating the pathogen is not necessarily sufficient for survival. This is particularly relevant during
sepsis, an infection in which the host response causes much more damage than the microbe itself. To address
this disconnect, over the past decade the Ayres lab has pioneered cooperative defenses, a new infection
defense framework focused on promoting health independent of pathogen burden. Cooperative defenses
include anti-virulence strategies which neutralize pathogen- or host-derived virulence signals before they cause
damage in the host (e.g. preventing maladaptive cytokine production) and disease tolerance strategies which
prevent physiological damage in the presence of virulence signals (e.g. metabolic shifts that prevent damage
from excess cytokine production). The Ayres lab has established a novel approach to identifying cooperative
defense mechanisms by leveraging the decades-old phenomenon of the lethal dose 50 (LD50). LD50 is the
dose of a pathogen that kills 50% of a genetically identical host population while the other 50% survives.
Strikingly, for many infections, surviving and dying LD50-infected mice exhibit the same pathogen burden
throughout the course of the infection, indicating that LD50-infected surviving mice survive due to differences in
their ability to engage cooperative defenses. An LD50 polymicrobial bacterial sepsis model has identified
serotonin neutralization as a candidate cooperative defense mechanism during sepsis. Preliminary data
demonstrates inhibiting peripheral serotonin during polymicrobial sepsis promotes health and survival through
cooperative defense mechanisms. While serotonin is most commonly studied in its role as a neurotransmitter,
95% of the body’s serotonin is found in the periphery, largely carried by platelets in circulation. Recent
research has begun to elucidate the role of this peripheral serotonin in regulating a wide variety of processes:
chief among these are inflammation and metabolism. Widespread platelet activation occurs during sepsis,
inducing platelet serotonin release, yet the effects of this serotonin and the means by which it is handled are
not well understood. Three specific aims will be addressed: 1) Determine the impact of serotonin on
cooperative defenses during sepsis, 2) Determine how inhibition of serotonin signaling promotes health and
survival during polymicrobial sepsis, and 3) Determine the mechanisms by which serotonin is neutralized
during a cooperative defense response to sepsis. This research will take place at the Salk Institute for
Biological Studies. In addition to these research objectives, the proposed training goals include improving
scientific mentoring and communication skills."

Distinct histone modifications, on N or C-terminal tails, act as a “histone code” to elicit downstream events.
Histone subunit post-translational modification (PTM), such as methylation, acetylation and phosphorylation
regulates epigenetic regulation and gene expression in diseases such as cancer. Here we identified a new PTM
on H3 called hydroxylation on proline 16, which is catalyzed by proline hydroxylase EglN2. Our preliminary data
show that EglN2-mediated H3 Pro16-OH leads to increased Lysine (K)-Specific Demethylase 5A (KDM5A)
binding corresponding with decreased H3K4me3 in breast cancer. We hypothesize that H3 prolyl hydroxylation
mediated by EglN2 recruits KDM5A therefore controlling gene expression important in breast cancer.
This is the first study reporting H3 Prolyl hydroxylation and its potential role in epigenetic regulation and gene
expression in cancer. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the effet of H3 prolyl hydroxylation on epigenetic
regulation and gene expression on a genome wide scale in breast cancer cells. In Specific Aim 2, we will
elucidate the molecular mechanism by which H3 prolyl hydroxylation regulates epigenetic reprogramming by
recruiting KDM5A. In Specific Aim 3, we will elucidate the molecular mechanism by which H3 prolyl hydroxylation
regulates Wnt/b-Catenin signaling in breast cancer cells. Successful completion of this proposal will characterize
a new H3 post-translational modification in its epigenetic regulation and gene expression important in breast
cancer."
10829810,"ABSTRACT
Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) is a devastating neurological disorder, characterized by disruption to ascending and
descending axonal networks, that can leave people paralyzed for life. After SCI, axons in spared white matter
(WM) regions attempt to undergo short-range sprouting to restore normal neurological function. However,
neuron-extrinsic factors that govern this short-range axon sprouting remain poorly understood. During
development and after injury, new axons spatiotemporally follow new blood vessels, hence intimately linking
axon sprouting to vasculature. Central Nervous System (CNS) vasculature is orchestrated by astrocytes, which
physically interact with endothelia and pericytes to form the gliovascular unit- a tissue niche with indispensable
roles in modulating blood flow and Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) maintenance. Astrocytes are also chief responders
to any CNS insult and undergo highly context dependent changes in morphology, gene expression, and function
in a process collectively referred to as “astrocyte reactivity”. Recent work in stroke and hypoxia have uncovered
necessary roles for reactive astrocytes in restorative angiogenesis, but specific astrocyte-secreted molecules
mediating these effects remain an outstanding question. I have recently identified a novel, spatially restricted
subpopulation of reactive astrocytes defined by persistent upregulation of the powerful pro-angiogenic molecule
CCN Family Member 1(CCN1). In my proposal I will utilize two independent, yet complimentary, aims to test the
hypothesis that Ccn1+ astrocytes demarcate an evolving pro-angiogenic tissue niche, that promotes functional
recovery after SCI by directly governing endothelial cell phenotype including cell proliferation, maturation, or
Notch signaling. In Aim 1 I will analyze a first of its kind longitudinal Spatial Transcriptomics dataset of spared
tissue regions in a mouse hemisection model of SCI (mhSCI) to A) interrogate the molecular evolution of
intraspinal tissue niches harboring Ccn1+ astrocytes, and B) establish a powerful resource for the SCI field. From
this aim I will understand the unique molecular features of Ccn1+ astrocyte niches and computationally infer the
evolution of associated biological processes, signaling cascades, and transcriptional regulators. In Aim 2 I will
complement the computational data from Aim 1 by utilizing a newly generated astrocyte specific CCN1 knockout
mouse for A) behavioral assays of locomotor recovery and B) histological assessment of endothelial cell
phenotype after mhSCI. From this aim I will interrogate the therapeutic potential of CCN1 for SCI and the direct
effect it has on endothelial cell specification. Taken together, this study will uncover the angiogenic potential of
tissue niches harboring Ccn1+ astrocytes and start to provide a glimpse into a potential mechanism of action.
Such findings may have important implications in the development of new therapeutics that are aimed at
providing a more permissive environment for regenerative axon sprouting after SCI."

Infection is among the leading causes of neonatal deaths worldwide. Serological immunity is considered to be
the most effective first line of defense against endemic pathogens. Understanding how this protective immunity
develops in early life is essential to identify areas of vulnerability and design strategies to combat neonatal
infections worldwide. This area of research however is underexplored. Several recent studies indicate that B cell
immunity starts to develop during fetal life. For instance, cord blood IgM present in the cord blood originate
exclusively from the fetus. Along the same line, IgG from fetal origin is also present in newborns blood although
its exact concentration is masked by the abundance of maternal IgG. Overall, very little is known about the
composition and repertoire of innate humoral immunity developed by the unborn child. The source of these
natural antibodies in the fetus is also unclear. Liver and spleen are important sites of B cell ontogeny in utero but
the differentiation of antibody-producing cells in these two organs during fetal life has not been reported. Our
recent work revealed an alternate and rather unexpected source of natural antibodies in newborns. We
uncovered that the human thymus at birth contains a significant contingent of antibody-producing PC. This
subset is surprisingly heterogenous and includes clones producing all classes and subclasses of immunoglobulin
with the exception of IgD. Furthermore, converging lines of evidence support the view that these PC differentiate
intrathymically through a mechanism that remains to be fully elucidated. Remarkably, ~7% of neonatal PC
reacted to at least 1 of 7 pathogenic and commensal bacteria tested. Neonatal thymic PC were also enriched in
clones reactive to apoptotic cells, a hallmark of natural antibodies. Collectively, these findings exposed the
human thymus as an unsuspected source of natural antibodies in human newborns. Investigating these thymic
PC will therefore provide a rare opportunity to examine how innate humoral immunity develops in humans. Here,
we further characterize the composition of neonatal thymic PC populations and more specifically identify
predominant clones which were more likely to have contributed to innate serological immunity. Studies will also
assess their reactivity profile toward bacteria as well as their protective capabilities. We anticipate these studies
will shed new light on this essential component of natural immune defenses against infections in early life.
Experiments will be carried out in two specific aims:
Aim 1. To characterize Nabs produced by dominant neonatal thymic plasma cells
Aim 2. To assess antibacterial activity of Nabs produced by neonatal thymic plasma cells"

 Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increase the morbidity and
mortality of the disease and are the major drivers of its high healthcare costs. Early treatment of exacerbations
with systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics has been shown to mitigate many of their negative effects.
However, prior efforts to detect exacerbations early enough to facilitate outpatient management have
demonstrated mixed results. Electronic monitoring, in which patients are remotely monitored for changes in
their clinical status, is a promising approach to detect exacerbations prior to presentation to care, facilitate
earlier connection to outpatient management, and prevent progression to hospitalization. Electronic inhaler
monitors can be attached to short-acting beta agonist (SABA) inhalers to record each actuation and transmit
that data to the healthcare team. Because patients are instructed to respond to worsening symptoms by
increasing use of their SABA inhalers, electronic inhaler monitors which detect this increase in use may be a
potential tool to identify clinical worsening. However, there has been little research examining the use of
electronic inhaler monitors in the early stages of a COPD exacerbation.
 To address this knowledge gap, we will conduct a secondary data analysis of an existing cohort of
>250 patients with COPD enrolled into the Medication Adherence Research in COPD Patients (MARC R01 HL
128620: PI Eakin) study. As part of the MARC study, participants are monitored with weekly electronic
symptom logs, electronic inhaler monitors, and monthly phone calls collecting information on recent
exacerbations for a 12-month monitoring period. In Specific Aim 1, we will leverage this data to demonstrate
that SABA use increases as respiratory symptoms worsen and then examine whether these increases in SABA
use are associated with increased odds of a moderate or severe exacerbation. Because prior research
suggests that not all patients with worsening symptoms increase their SABA use as instructed, in Specific Aim
2 we will evaluate whether patient-level risk factors, such as low cognitive functioning, are associated with this
type of poor self-management. In Specific Aim 3, we will conduct a qualitative study using semi-structured
interviews guided by the framework of Self-Regulation Theory to explore participants’ thought processes
around their self-management during periods of worsening symptoms. This research will therefore not only
evaluate the associations among respiratory symptoms, SABA use, and exacerbations but also seeks to shed
light on patient subgroups that struggle to effectively self-manage their worsening symptoms.
 This proposal will provide the applicant with the necessary training to develop the quantitative and
qualitative skills needed to pursue an independent career as a health services researcher in COPD."

Stroke is the 5th leading cause of death in the United States, and nearly 8 million Americans report it as their
primary reason for disability. For many with hemiparesis caused by their stroke, existing rehabilitative therapies
have failed to deliver sustained improvements in functional recovery. These therapies either focus on only the
impaired limb or rely on training tasks with little resemblance to activities of daily living. Emerging research
suggests that bilateral training may provide improvements beyond unilateral training alone, but the mechanisms
underlying these benefits remain unknown. Therefore, the objective of this proposal is to determine the motor
control and neuromuscular mechanisms responsible for bilateral coordinated reaching in stroke. To do this, we
have developed a rehabilitation platform that uses virtual reality and exoskeleton technologies to provide the
task and environmental constraints necessary to increase the use of the paretic limb in chronic stroke survivors.
Our preliminary results in healthy controls and 4 stroke participants show that our system can change both the
kinematic and neuromuscular control of upper extremity reaching. Our overarching hypothesis is that hemiplegic
stroke participants respond these novel task and environmental constraints by adopting an optimal reaching
strategy that manifests as systematic changes in impaired arm displacement and muscle activity. Specifically, in
Aim 1 we will explore the tradeoff between arm displacement and muscle activity during a bimanual reaching
task and in Aim 2, we will establish a neuromuscular mechanism of impaired limb recruitment during this task.
Specifically, we use an advanced electromyographical technique to measure coactivation of homologous muscle
pairs. Together, these two Aims will identify the kinematic and neuromuscular mechanisms responsible for
functional changes in bilateral coordination in chronic stroke survivors. The proposed research is supported by
a well-established mentorship team the spans clinical neurology, rehabilitation sciences, and biomedical
engineering. The work will be carried out in a unique collaboration between Georgetown University, the MedStar
National Rehabilitation Hospital, and The Catholic University of America. These institutions are perfectly
integrated to provide the clinical, technical, and intellectual environment needed to complete the proposed work.
Training will include mentored clinical experience with acute and chronic stroke survivors and train the applicant
in advanced engineering approaches to stroke rehabilitation. Finally, the training plan is designed to transition
the applicant into an independent research career focused on exploring the next generation of technological
solutions to therapeutic challenges."

This postdoctoral training program at McLean Hospital is designed to address gaps in psychiatry and
neuroscience training that limit effective communication across disciplines and translation of discoveries into
new treatments. In psychiatry, rapid advances in technology are changing the ways in which psychiatric illness
is diagnosed, treated, and studied. In humans, continued refinements in brain imaging, increasing utilization of
smart devices, and improvements in the efficiency of genetic tools are among developments enabling
fundamentally new insights into healthy and aberrant brain function, as well as molecular factors that contribute
to vulnerability to illness. In animal model systems, there has been a corresponding evolution of precision
molecular techniques to probe and dissect the neural circuitry underlying motivational and emotional behavior.
Despite these advances, psychiatry and neuroscience continue to evolve in parallel, with precious few examples
where the fields have aligned to produce transformative changes in human health. One indicator of this parallel
evolution is stagnation in development of new treatments; indeed, difficulties in developing CNS drugs with new
mechanisms have led to a massive divestment by industry. While many factors contribute to these failures, most
are related to a lack of forward- (animal to human) and back- (human to animal) translation of key discoveries,
leading to questions about the usefulness of model systems in drug development. Enhancing alignment of
psychiatry and neuroscience is critical to invigorate translationally-relevant discoveries in clinical and basic
research. With its combined clinical, research, and academic missions, McLean is optimally positioned to play
a key role in establishing more impactful interactions between psychiatry and neuroscience. Research occurs
in >100 labs across clinical, preclinical, and basic neuroscience programs that are intertwined, in adjacent labs
or neighboring buildings, enabling routine interactions among clinicians, neuroscientists, and trainees (residents,
postdocs, students). As a freestanding psychiatric hospital—perennially ranked #1 in this category—there is
expertise in a broad range of NIMH-relevant domains. McLean has unique attributes, including the Institute for
Technology in Psychiatry, to facilitate efforts to align research in humans and animals. This T32 program will
provide resources for 6 slots per year to support activities for postdoctoral trainees across a range of experience
levels for up to 3 years. The main objectives include (1) exposing a diverse group of trainees with backgrounds
in clinical care to basic neuroscience research, and vice-versa, (2) providing comprehensive training that
prioritizes emerging technologies such as digital phenotyping, biomarkers, and genetics to enable rigorous study
of homologous endpoints in humans and animals, (3) ensuring a balanced experience via dual mentors with
complementary expertise, and (4) leveraging the dual mentorship design to train emerging mentors. Progress
towards these goals will be overseen by a McLean leadership team and an External Advisory Committee
comprising world-renowned experts in psychiatry, neuroscience, training, and therapeutics development."

Obesity is an ongoing epidemic and a serious public health problem. Preventative and therapeutic interventions
have mostly focused on diet and physical activity, aimed to understand mechanism and improve efficacy. Notably,
there has been a long-term debate over whether macronutrient content in the diet, specifically a low fat vs. low
carbohydrate diet can help in management of body mass. Recent insights into the involvement of the circadian
system in energy balance control offer a new perspective to understand the relationship between macronutrient
intake and weight control. We and others have shown that disruption of the circadian system leads to adverse
metabolic effects, including changes in energy balance control mechanisms that can increase the risk for obesity.
Indeed, circadian disruption is a recognized critical risk factor for metabolic disorders, as also recognized by the
Nobel Prize Committee who awarded the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to three circadian pioneers.
Given the intimate reciprocal interactions between metabolism and the circadian clock, it has been proposed
that dietary macronutrient content may impact whole-body physiology in part through changes in the circadian
organization. Consistently, breakthrough animal experimental work has shown that high fat diet leads to
disrupted circadian rhythms, including blunted rhythms and lengthened circadian period (cycle length). These
findings are consistent with our Preliminary Data in humans, in which we found that higher percentage of 24-h
fat intake is associated with (i) a blunted endogenous circadian rhythm in hunger; (ii) a higher caloric intake in
the biological evening; (iii) lengthened endogenous circadian period; and (iv) a delayed endogenous circadian
phase. Taken together, these results provided strong premise for high fat diet-induced circadian disruption.
However, despite the growing realization of the importance of circadian organization and the influence of fat
intake on the circadian system, there is very limited experimental data in humans that has tested the effect of
high fat diet on the circadian clock or circadian control of metabolism. Therefore, in this proposal, we will address
these knowledge gaps by testing the following hypotheses: high fat diet, as compared to low fat diet results in
(Aim 1) blunting and delaying of endogenous circadian rhythms of the central clock and measures related to the
peripheral clocks; (Aim 2) blunting and delaying in daily and endogenous circadian rhythms in energy intake-
related measures; (Exploratory Aim 3) blunting and delaying in daily and endogenous circadian rhythms in
energy expenditure-related measures. These aims will be tested in a within-subject, randomized, crossover
design in healthy individuals undergoing two protocols. Each of both protocols has a short-term field-based
dietary intervention (2 weeks to avoid substantial weight change) followed by a 6-day highly controlled in-
laboratory visit. Understand the link between macronutrient intake and the circadian system will lay the
groundwork for evidence-based dietary intervention integrating timing in the prevention and treatment of obesity
and metabolic health."

Adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs), such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, intrauterine growth
restriction, and preterm birth, occur in about 20% of pregnancies and are associated with excess lifelong
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk for women. However, levels of traditional CVD risk factors may not identify
all women progressing towards CVD after an APO. Data suggest that more sensitive measures are needed to
identify premenopausal women on track to develop CVD after APOs, especially non-hypertensive APOs.
Pulsatile hemodynamic dysfunction, i.e., high arterial pressure wave reflection magnitude, high systolic
pressure augmentation, and high central arterial stiffness, can precede left ventricular structural abnormalities,
diastolic dysfunction, hypertension, and overt CVD and can be improved or reversed with lifestyle modification.
Small, single center studies have reported changes in vascular function during pregnancies with and without
APOs and vascular dysfunction in women after some types of APOs. The NHLBI recently funded a
continuation of the nuMoM2b Heart Health Study (HHS2; 1U01HL145358-01A1; PIs: McNeil, Greenland, and
Saade), which will be conducted in >4,000 demographically diverse women. The HHS2 was designed to
further understanding of early CVD development after APOs. Women were initially enrolled at the beginning of
their first pregnancy, and available data include detailed pregnancy information, biospecimens, and CVD risk
factor assessment over 7 years of follow-up. We propose the addition of non-invasive pulsatile hemodynamic
measurements to data collection procedures for a subset of participants enrolled in HHS2, including central
arterial stiffness and arterial wave reflection measurements. Our Aims are as follows: Aim 1: Compare
vascular function measurements between women who did and did not have an APO. Account for lifestyle
behaviors and APO types. Aim 2. Define associations of early pregnancy biomarkers with poor pulsatile
hemodynamics. Our study will aid in sex-specific identification of higher-risk individuals with normal levels of
traditional CVD risk factors and define associations with molecular phenotypes in early pregnancy. We will
reveal modifiable lifestyle factors associated with pulsatile hemodynamics, thus informing preventive strategies
and setting the stage for interventions. The measurements will enrich the HHS2 dataset. The study will fill a
key knowledge gap regarding silent CVD in premenopausal women and directly aligns with the objective of
improving understanding and identification of early CVD development after different APOs."

The ability to integrate color and form into coherent visual scenes is an important part of our interactions with
the environment. This ability is impaired in many ophthalmologic and neuropsychiatric disorders, yet the neural
mechanisms responsible for visual feature integration remain understudied. The use of mice as a model
organism has provided deep insights into fundamental mechanisms of vison conserved across species and
general principles of neural information processing. Recent work in mice has shown that the early mouse
visual system is wired to respond to chromatic information and mice can use this information to guide behavior.
However, it is unclear how the early visual system integrates spectral and luminance contrasts to represent
color spatially. My own preliminary data has demonstrated that neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V1)
can respond to spatial luminance contrast (i.e., form) in a color-dependent manner, building on work
demonstrating responses to color contrast in in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGN) – the
preceding stage of visual hierarchy. This suggests that color and form begin their integration through
thalamocortical networks, though the exact mechanism of integration is unknown.
 Thus, the goal of this proposal is to ask how, neurally, are variations in color and luminance integrated
to generate spatial chromatic contrast? To do this, I will need to measure responses from a large number of
neurons in LGN and V1 to capture the breadth of chromatic responses and relevant connections between
regions. Leveraging the relative scale of the mouse visual system and high-density electrophysiology, this
project will examine mechanisms of spatial chromatic integration with a high degree of spatiotemporal
resolution. Aim 1 will examine the functional convergence of chromatic and achromatic signals from LGN to
produce chromatic selectivity in V1. Aim 2 will then examine if and how intracortical networks enhance
chromatic selectivity to refine color tuning for subsequent stages of visual processing.
 In sum, this proposal will expand our fundamental understanding of how the early visual system
integrates color and luminance spatially, providing a steppingstone to further experiments investigating how
color integrates with specific visual features such as orientation, direction, motion, and ultimately how color is
integrated into complex naturalistic scenes. This work will also provide the applicant with invaluable training in
his future career as a neuropsychiatrist focused on translating foundational knowledge from computational
neuroscience into novel, highly precise therapeutics."

 Eccrine sweat glands are the most abundant gland in our skin and are essential for thermoregulation
and skin homeostasis. It was only recently that multipotent stem cells in the sweat glands were identified,
which presented great potential for de novo sweat gland regeneration. Further, in order to make sweat glands
functional, precise innervation and neuronal control are indispensable. Neuronal signals elicit sweating; but
also, are necessary for sweat gland maturation based on prior work in our lab. Sweat glands and neurons rely
on each other for proper development; however, very little is known about how neuronal inputs influence sweat
gland development, especially the sweat gland stem cells. We hypothesize that neuronal innervation is
critical for the maintenance of sweat gland stem cells during development. Using mouse sweat gland as
a model, we will investigate the molecular changes in the sweat gland stem cells during development when
lacking innervation, and further identify the downstream pathway within sweat gland stem cells that mediates
the effect of neurotransmitters upon stem cell maintenance. This proposal aims to i) investigate the effect of
neuronal input during sweat gland development ii) understand the role of neurotransmitters in sweat gland
development iii) examine whether calcium mediates neuronal control of the sweat gland stem cells. These
studies will provide greater insight into how nerves regulate the development and maintenance of sweat
glands. Further, this proposal will establish a foundational understanding of how sweat glands and neurons
develop into a function unit which will be useful for regenerative therapies."

 Relative to males, females exhibit greater cognitive decline and are more severely impacted by age-related
disease (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease (AD)). The impact of AD risk factors such as the apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4)
allele, accumulation of AD biomarkers, and cognitive impairment with AD is more pronounced in females and
does not simply reflect their greater longevity. The reasons for these sex differences remains unclear, thus, it is
important to probe the biological underpinnings of sex distinctions in the aging brain. Menopause may contribute
to the disproportionate impact of aging on females as it is accompanied by a large decrease in estrogens, which
have neuroprotective effects on brain health and cognition. Notably, AD pathology begins to develop decades
before clinical symptom onset, and this preclinical phase of AD overlaps with the menopausal transition during
mid-life (late 40s-early 50s). Thus, the depletion of estrogen with menopause may increase female susceptibility
to AD pathogenesis. In fact, changes in reproductive hormones have been associated with increased risk for
developing AD and poor memory function. The medial temporal lobe (MTL) network, which is important for
memory, is dysfunctional in aging and AD. Deficits in emotional memory are observed with the menopausal
transition and early development of AD pathology. Moreover, early changes in emotional memory brain networks,
including the MTL, have been discovered in preclinical AD and are the first to accumulate AD pathology. Given
substantial evidence of interactions between menopause and early AD, interrogating the linkage between
reproductive aging and AD risk is critical for uncovering sex-specific factors involved in age-related disease and
creating novel approaches to treatment or prevention. However, work on the impact of menopause in aging
females is lacking, especially in the context of genetic risk for AD. To address these gaps, the proposed project
will examine the effect of estrogen decline with menopause on MTL network dynamics and emotional memory
in cognitively normal females at risk for AD (e.g., ApoE4+). Aim 1 will establish the relationship between estrogen
levels and AD risk in aging females, Aim 2 will quantify the impact of estrogen on MTL network connectivity in
aging females at risk for AD, and Aim 3 will determine the effect of estrogen on MTL activation and emotional
memory in females at risk for AD. Together, the proposed work will provide important new insight into the
biological mechanisms underlying sex differences in AD. Examining the impact of menopause in cognitively
normal aging during the same timeframe that AD pathology begins could provide a novel approach towards the
early detection of AD. These aims will offer many training opportunities for the applicant, who will gain proficiency
in complex neuroimaging analyses, enhanced statistical skills, application of aging research towards disease
states (e.g., AD), and valuable mentorship experience. The training opportunities facilitated by this work will
accelerate the applicant’s transition to an independent career focused on sex differences in aging outcomes."
10843742,"Understanding the functional impact of genetic variation, particularly its impact on
disease, remains a key challenge in human genetics. Most disease-associated genetic loci lie in
regulatory regions of the human genome and are suspected to act by regulating the expression
levels of nearby genes. Yet despite extensive efforts to characterize genetic regulatory effects
on gene expression, most disease loci have not been explained by association with expression
levels. Pervasive context-specificity of these regulatory effects introduces one key bottleneck
contributing to this discrepancy. Detecting regulatory effects requires observation of gene
expression in the specific cell states where the effect is active, and large-scale efforts have
primarily focused on measuring expression levels in healthy adult tissues. Characterizing
genetic regulation in increasingly diverse and dynamic cellular contexts will therefore reveal
novel genetic regulatory effects which may help elucidate molecular mechanisms of disease
loci.
 To analyze genetic regulation of gene expression in diverse cellular contexts we will
leverage single-cell RNA-sequencing of embryoid bodies from multiple human donors.
Embryoid bodies are three-dimensional aggregates of induced pluripotent stem cells that
spontaneously differentiate into dozens of non-discrete cell types. Analysis of expression at the
single-cell level will enable us to cut through the heterogeneity of these complex aggregates and
map each cell to a unique position within a clearly defined differentiation landscape. Embryoid
bodies thus offer a unified experimental framework for the study of diverse differentiation
trajectories, accelerating the exploration of genetic regulation across the many cell states that
may contribute to human disease.
 In this proposed research, I will develop novel computational and statistical tools that
leverage the expansive and multifurcating landscape of cellular differentiation to improve our
ability to resolve context-specific and dynamic genetic regulatory effects. I will develop a
probabilistic model to compare gene expression dynamics between individuals, and a
hypothesis testing framework to attribute inter-individual differences to genetic variation. I will
validate the dynamic genetic regulatory effects we discover using in vitro and in vivo chromatin
accessibility data. Finally, I will search for overlap between newly discovered regulatory variants
and known disease loci to reveal novel insights into the target genes mediating genetic effects
on common diseases."

Training: The purpose of this K23 proposal is to prepare Dr. Diana Montoya-Williams for a career as an
independent clinician scientist. Her long-term career objectives are to contribute to the development of
policies and interventions that diminish health disparities among pregnant minority women and their infants.
Her immediate goal is to obtain the knowledge and skills to complete rigorous longitudinal studies of
maternal-infant dyads aimed at defining assets that protect women against adverse neonatal outcomes. To
meet these goals, Dr. Montoya-Williams and her mentor team have devised a career development plan
that integrates: 1) intensive mentorship from successful investigators; 2) focused training in longitudinal
cohort and statistical path analyses; and 3) innovative research on the relationship between resilience,
stress and adverse neonatal outcome disparities.
Research: Significant racial, ethnic and nativity-related disparities exist for birth weight, gestational length
and breastfeeding in the U.S. and have major implications for our elevated infant mortality rates. Maternal
psychosocial stress has been linked to these adverse neonatal outcomes and is disproportionately
experienced by minority women. Resilience is the ability to respond to stress and appears to change in the
face of stressors. Higher resilience has been linked to improved outcomes in conditions like diabetes and
cardiovascular disease; there is also evidence that resilience can be improved. However, our knowledge of
resilience in pregnancy is scarce and a major limitation is the cross-sectional nature of existing data. It is
not clear whether resilience changes through the course of pregnancy and whether it modifies the
relationship that exists between maternal stress and adverse neonatal outcomes. In addition, resilience
may vary by race, ethnicity and nativity but data is limited. Dr. Montoya-Williams’ mentored research will
address these key knowledge gaps. By creating a diverse longitudinal cohort of pregnant women, she will:
1) explore the association between resilience, three different types of perceived self-reported stress (acute,
intermediate chronic and remote traumatic) and the physiologic manifestations of stress (i.e. allostatic load)
at the onset of pregnancy; 2) describe whether resilience measured repeatedly in pregnancy changes in
response to acute pregnancy-related stressors; and 3) investigate associations between the trajectory of
resilience in pregnancy and adverse neonatal outcomes. Importantly, she will describe any differences that
may exist in these relationships for women of different ethnoracial and cultural backgrounds.
Summary: Findings from this study will inform an R01 proposal to test resilience interventions that may
mitigate the stress-related drivers of neonatal health disparities. Through this award, Dr. Montoya-Williams
will also emerge as a leading independent clinician scientist contributing to the amelioration of neonatal
racial/ethnic health disparities."

A cellular hallmark of inherited retinal degenerative diseases, such as Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), is progressive
loss of photoreceptors until the individual is completely blind. With degeneration starting at an early age, many
patients with RP become blind early on in their adulthood. Affecting 100,000 people annually in the US alone
and being the second most prominent genetic retinal degenerative disease worldwide, research is necessary in
order to identify therapies that can improve the quality of life for these patients. Unlike mammalian models,
Zebrafish (Zf) have a remarkable capacity to regenerate neurons following retinal injury or disease, making them
a suitable model organism for regenerative studies. Current studies in Zf have indicated that upon detection of
retinal insult, Mϋller glial cells (MGCs) are reprogrammed to re-enter the cell cycle, asymmetrically divide, and
produce multi-potent progenitor cells. These newly formed progenitor cells rapidly proliferate and re-differentiate
to replace lost retinal cells. Several genes, pathways, and transcriptional factors have been shown to play a role
in reprogramming MGCs, inducing progenitor cell proliferation, and differentiating these cells into functional inner
retinal neurons; however, the mechanisms by which genes work together spatially and temporally to regenerate
rods in a model with chronic retinal degeneration remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to understand
the regeneration mechanisms of rod photoreceptors in Zf and to identify the master regulatory genes crucial for
their lineage trajectory. Our preliminary analyses have identified a group of retinal progenitor cells believed to be
responsible for rod photoreceptor regeneration. Aim 1 of this proposal will assess the roles of candidate
regulatory genes and transcription factors in the differentiation of these progenitor cells into rod photoreceptors.
Aim 2 will assess the lineage trajectory of progenitor cells to form rod photoreceptors and identify when and how
the progenitor cells are formed. Upon successful completion of this project, I will have identified the set of
transcription factors needed to induce rod photoreceptor regeneration in adult Zf. The ultimate goal of this project
is to provide the targets necessary to restore vision in blind patients with retinal degenerative diseases such as
RP so that they may have an improved quality of life."

Maternal survivors of IPV and their children often face ongoing abuse and harassment, safety concerns, lack of
financial resources, and legal constraints around custody following separation from an abusive partner that
may impact children’s health, school engagement, and flourishing and impede their children’s access to health
care. The purpose of this exploratory mixed-methods study is to develop knowledge of post-separation abuse
and examine how post-separation abuse predicts pediatric health and flourishing outcomes. The specific aims
are: 1) Understand post-separation experiences of maternal IPV survivors including post-separation abuse,
their children’s health and flourishing, and the structural context of family court, 2) Examine if the prevalence of
children’s special health care needs, unmet health needs, school engagement, and flourishing differs for
children exposed to post-separation abuse as compared to US children overall, 3a) Test construct validity and
reliability of new items developed from the qualitative phase as measures of post-separation abuse, 3b)
Determine if post-separation abuse predicts children’s health and flourishing outcomes. The study will begin
with a qualitative arm using iterative thematic inquiry to explore maternal survivors experiences of post-
separation abuse and their children’s health (n=30). The qualitative arm will also identify new items of post-
separation abuse not captured by existing measures of coercive control (WEB) and the risk of lethality (DA) to
create a new scale (Maternal Child Experiences of Post-Separation Abuse, or “MCEPSA” Scale) that will be
tested in the exploratory quantitative arm. In the second quantitative phase, cross-sectional surveys will be
administered to mothers (n=150) to assess their children’s (age 6-17) unmet health needs, special health care
needs, school engagement, and flourishing utilizing items from the NSCH, and then compare prevalence rates
of children in our recruited sample to national prevalence data from the NSCH using test of proportions. In
addition, we will conduct preliminary psychometric testing of the new items from the qualitative arm. Further,
the study will use logistic regression to examine which measure (WEB, DA, MCEPSA) of post separation
abuse best predicts children’s unmet health needs and special health care needs and to determine if the new
items in the MCEPSA are significant above and beyond the WEB and DA in predicting children’s special health
care needs and unmet health needs. Finally, the results of the quantitative and qualitative phases will be
integrated, and the quantitative data will be presented along with themes and quotes from the qualitative data.
This mixed-methods study will document health disparities and provide foundational knowledge for nursing,
policy makers, public health professionals, and judicial decision-makers to understand how post-separation
abuse and the structural context including family court processes combine in complex ways to affect children’s
health and flourishing. The study will identify potential areas of intervention in order to develop differential
systems responses to promote positive health for children exposed to post-separation abuse."
10814182,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Core B: Organoid Core)
Infectious disease research is substantially hampered by lack of experimental models necessary to study
interactions between pathogens and target tissues; a glaring deficiency amplified by the recent COVID-19
pandemic. The recent advent of 3D organoid methods embodies a more physiologic in vitro infectious disease
platform. Over the past 5 years, the Stanford NAMSED U19 Center has operated an Organoid Core, led by
Calvin Kuo, which has distributed approximately 74 organoid lines for modeling infectivity of gastrointestinal
pathogens, resulting in numerous collaborative publications. The Organoid Core has also produced new air-
liquid interface (ALI) organoids that maintain epithelium and infiltrating immune populations en bloc without
reconstitution (Cell, 2018) and created new protocols for long-term, feeder-free, chemically defined human lung
distal organoid culture, as well as novel human nasal sinus organoids (Cell Stem Cell, 2020).
 The overall goal for Core B (Organoid Core) in our renewal application of the Stanford NAMSED U19 for
a Stanford/UNC Biomimetic U19 Research Center is to expand upon our previous success and provide novel
ex vivo models for studying gastrointestinal and respiratory pathogens. Thus, Core B will serve as a central
biohub for our Center by generating and distributing next-generation human gastrointestinal and respiratory
organoid cultures to support Projects 1-3. In addition to these core responsibilities, the Kuo lab will optimize
innovative organoid-based assays that will provide additional support for Projects 1-3 and resources for the
global research community. In Aim 1, human “epithelial-only” organoids from the stomach, small intestine, distal
lung and nasal airways will be generated, characterized, and distributed for Project 1 (H. pylori, S. Typhi, S.
Typhimurium), Project 2 (rotavirus), and Project 3 (SARS-CoV-2, MERS, pre-epidemic coronaviruses and 1918
influenza H1N1 virus). There has been a particular lack of organoid methods incorporating endogenous immune
populations without reconstitution. Thus, Aim 2 develops innovative ALI organoid methods preserving epithelial
and endogenous infiltrating immune cells en bloc for defining cross-talk between epithelial and immune
compartments during GI and pulmonary infections. Lastly, Aim 3 optimizes multiplexed organoid platforms for
pathogen infection and drug screening to provide novel methods for evaluating infection, therapeutics and
immune responses.
 Overall, Core B of the Stanford/UNC Biomimetic U19 Research Center leverages leading-edge expertise
in primary 3D human organoid culture for the study of enteric and respiratory pathogens. Additionally, we
capitalize on novel organoid methods preserving both the epitheilal and immune components to provide
innovative holistic tools to dissect pathways involved during pathogenic infection, with both basic and
translational implications."
10814189,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Project 1)
Helicobacter pylori and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (Typhi) are both strictly human-adapted pathogens
that colonize the stomach and intestine and are major public health threats worldwide that disproportionally affect
populations with lower socioeconomic resources. H. pylori chronically infects over 50% of the world population
and is the main risk factor for peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. About 77% (812,000) of new cases of gastric
cancer were attributable to H. pylori in 2018 (GLOBOCAN). Gastric cancer is the 3rd leading cause of cancer
death worldwide with about 783,000 deaths reported in 2018 (WHO). Typhi infects more than 20 million people
yearly and causes over 500,000 deaths annually from Typhoid fever. Both H. pylori and Salmonella have evolved
molecular adaptations to chronically colonize human mucosal surfaces and evade clearance from host innate
and adaptive immune responses. In addition, both are becoming increasingly difficult to treat because of rising
antibiotic resistance and poor understanding of their persistence mechanisms. We will address these emerging
problems by leveraging novel biomimetic platforms of human-derived gastric and intestinal organoids including
1) a method to reverse the polarity and control the differentiation of three-dimensional epithelial organoids in
suspension to expose the apical surface for infection studies, 2) a method to induce differentiation of intestinal
microfold (M) cells, and 3) an air-liquid interface culture method to preserve the endogenous mucosal immune
system. We will use these platforms to address difficult-to-model problems, including: 1) defining and
manipulating critical niches that enable bacterial colonization of the epithelial surface, 2) elucidating specialized
sites of invasion and intracellular replication in the mucosa, and 3) understanding secondary activation of
immune responses and immune feedback on the epithelium that control bacterial colonization and disease
progression. These studies will lead to the identification of new pathways that could serve as novel targets for

 Rotavirus (RV) infection kills 200,000 children annually. Rotaviruses are non-enveloped, triple-layered,
icosahedral viruses with dsRNA genomes composed of 11 separate segments. RVs are ubiquitous, highly
infectious and cause severe diarrheal diseases in the young of most mammalian species including humans. RV
remains the primary cause of acute life-threatening diarrhea in infants and young children under the age of four.
RVs can also afflict elderly, immunocompromised, and healthy adults but disease is generally less severe.
Despite the availability of several safe and effective vaccines, RV causes 114 million diarrhea episodes, 24
million outpatient visits, 2.4 million hospitalizations, and approximately 200,000 deaths in young children
annually. Currently available licensed vaccines have limited efficacy (<60%) in most parts of the less-developed
world. The lack of highly effective RV vaccines for the third world is due, at least in part, to an incomplete
understanding of RV interactions with the enteric immune system and gut. Using primary small bowel enteroids,
we previously made several seminal discoveries on the mechanisms that regulate RV host range restriction
(HRR), neutralization, and spread across the intestine. Our goal is to build on these successes to understand
key features of RV biology, pathogenesis, and immunity. We will take advantage of recent technological
advances including: i) use of human donor-derived small bowel enteroids to model human RV infection in and
through the gut; ii) development of an efficient reverse genetics (RG) system to modify RV genomes; and iii)
development of a system to differentiate functional microfold (M) cells in ileum organoids. This project has the
following three Aims:
1) We will use our optimized RG system to generate targeted genetic reassortants between human and select
animal RVs and examine their replication and abilities to inhibit innate immune responses in human organoids.
We expect to identify the genetic basis of human RV HRR, which will prove useful to guide the rational design
of third-generation RV vaccines. 2) We will perform competition blocking analysis and crystallographic
examination of mAb/RV protein interactions to elucidate the structural basis of human RV neutralization in the
human gut and use a novel genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening approach to identify the RV-specific binding
dependency factors on the enterocyte surface. 3) We will employ genetic tools (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of
STAT1) or pharmacological inhibition of IFN signaling (i.e., ruxolitinib) to determine whether disabling innate
immunity renders M cells susceptible to RV infection. Finally, we will examine whether the M cells function as
critical entry conduits to widespread epithelial cell infection via creating basolateral cell surface access. These
RV studies and findings should also be broadly relevant to other enteric pathogens and non-infectious intestinal
inflammatory diseases as well."
10814200,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (Project 3)
Zoonotic coronaviruses (CoV) are responsible for three major epidemics/pandemics in the 21st century, including
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and Middle East Respiratory coronavirus (MERS-
CoV) in 2012. In Dec 2019, a third novel coronavirus (CoV) designated SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan China
and in the space of 5 months, has caused over 6.5 million cases, >300,000 deaths in >200 countries. Over 1/3
of these total cases have been reported in the US, resulting in over 100,000 deaths. In humans, virus infection
results in COVID-19 disease, characterized by pneumonia and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS), an often fatal end-stage lung disease. In addition to SARS-CoV2, multiple other SARS-like and MERS-
like CoV strains reside in bats and other species and are poised to emerge at some point in the future. We have
little understanding of the tropism and host signaling networks associated with epidemic and pre-epidemic
emerging coronavirus infections in the human lung and other organs. Moreover, the SARS-CoV-2 virus-host
interaction networks associated with virus replication in the lung and their association with chronic disease
manifestations in vivo remain unknown. We propose to take advantage of recent technological advances in
human tissue engineering to mimic virus infection of mucosal surfaces. The overall goal of this proposal is to
study the interaction networks with associated with emerging coronavirus infection of primary lung organoid
cultures. We will focus on previously difficult-to-model critical problems, such as virus tropism, virus-host
interaction networks in within and between patient codes and innate immune activation in the airway epithelium
and surrounding tissues. The proposal also relies on mouse organoid cultures and models of human disease,
promoting an integrated platform to identify highly efficacious small molecule inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Aim
1 establishes SARS-CoV-2 infection conditions in human lung organoids. Aim 2 investigates SARS-CoV-2-
stimulated epithelial-immune interactions in lung ALI organoids. Aim 3 development of lung organoid cultures for
SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics screening."
10901838,"Mentorship in research on opioid use disorder, HIV and marginalized populations
People who inject drugs (PWID) are at high risk for overdose and increasing HIV risk, yet they sub-optimally
receive evidence-based opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment and HIV prevention measures. Engaging PWID
and persons with OUD from marginalized groups requires innovative approaches. Aaron D. Fox, MD MS is an
Addiction Medicine physician and Associate Professor of Medicine at Albert Einstein College of Medicine-
Montefiore Medical Center. He is an experienced research mentor, the director of the Bronx Transitions Clinic,
which provides a medical home to formerly incarcerated individuals, and the principal investigator of two
clinical trials of innovative buprenorphine treatment interventions (see below). Einstein-Montefiore’s Institute for
Clinical and Translational Research, and the Einstein-Rockefeller-CUNY Center for AIDS Research, provide an
outstanding environment for supporting early-stage investigators and trainees. As part of the NIH HEAL
initiative, Einstein-Montefiore was recently awarded one of four IMPOWR grants to develop a research center
on chronic pain and OUD. In this K24 mid-career mentorship award, Dr. Fox proposes to capitalize upon these
resources in mentoring six talented early-stage investigators in research on OUD, HIV, and marginalized
populations. Dr. Fox would also gain skills in mentoring, new research methods, and drug policy leadership
with the following career development objectives: 1) To provide outstanding mentorship to diverse early-stage
investigators who will develop independent research careers in OUD treatment and HIV prevention; 2) To gain
skills in internet-mediated HIV prevention research; and 3) To translate evidence into clinical guidelines and
policy regarding access to addiction treatment and HIV prevention services. To meet these objectives, Dr. Fox
will convene an advisory team with expertise in mentoring, internet-mediated research, and drug policy, while
participating in training specific to research mentoring and health policy leadership. Dr. Fox’s current studies
provide a unique environment where early-stage investigators can participate in patient-oriented research in
primary care, hospitals, syringe services programs, and a post-incarceration “transitions clinic.” Dr. Fox leads
two large randomized controlled trials: buprenorphine microdose inductions for hospitalized patients with
chronic pain (RM1DA055437), and the effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of buprenorphine
treatment initiation at syringe services programs (R01DA044878). This application also proposes new internet-
mediated HIV prevention research in collaboration with NEXT Distro, the first formal internet-based mail
delivery syringe services program in the United States. These studies will serve as a platform for trainees to
develop careers in patient-oriented research that is highly relevant for drug policy and clinical guidelines.
Completion of the proposed K24 award would advance research in OUD treatment and HIV prevention, while
also expanding and diversifying the research workforce dedicated to OUD, HIV, and marginalized populations."
10816488,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Among persons aged 65 and older, falls are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality and impose
significant social and economic burdens on community health services and healthcare systems. Although
evidence shows that group-based, in-person exercise interventions improve strength, balance, and dual-task
abilities and consequently directly and indirectly reduce the incidence of falls effectively in older adults, such
approaches are problematic in practice because they can be costly, have limited reach, can be logistically
difficult to implement, and are often not scalable or generalizable. Therefore, timely identification of alternative
implementation strategies that can overcome these limitations to expand delivery of fall prevention
interventions to the aging population at greatest risk for falls is of high public health importance and clinical
relevance. In response to implementation challenges and community care needs in fall prevention, the primary
objective of this project is to evaluate a home-based virtual fall prevention exercise intervention that eliminates
common barriers to older adults participating in group-based in-person intervention programs. The proposed
intervention is founded on the evidence-based Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance (TJQMBB) program,
which has been specifically reconfigured into a virtual format (V-TJQMBB) delivered through real-time
videoconferencing at home. Supported by promising data on feasibility, acceptability, and demand, we propose
a 6-month randomized controlled virtual trial to determine the comparative effectiveness of the V-TJQMBB
intervention, relative to a virtual multimodal exercise intervention, in lowering the incidence of falls (primary
outcome) and improving dual-task performance and physical and cognitive functioning (secondary outcomes)
among at-risk older adults living across the U.S. We will also (a) evaluate whether the benefits of the V-
TJQMBB intervention on falls can be sustained following formal training and (b) examine the mechanisms
(mediators of improved dual-task cost and executive function) through which the V-TJQMBB intervention
reduces fall rates. In addition, we will explore implementation potential by examining practical issues, including
intervention fidelity, compliance, acceptability, and perceived burdens and benefits of online exercise. The
proposed project is novel because it represents a paradigm shift in program delivery from in-person to virtual
and is significant because the clinical value of many home-based fall prevention interventions remains
inconclusive. If successful, the proposed study will extend the reach and impact of the evidence-based
TJQMBB intervention beyond locally situated community-facility settings to home settings where access is not
weather limited, transportation dependent, or geographically bounded. Thus, this proposal advances
dissemination and implementation research by providing a scalable, flexible, and fiscally responsible means for
sustainable fall prevention that potentially could be implemented across the country."
10823288,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a major global health concern that continues to rise at an alarming rate
driven by the tide of the obesity pandemic. It is well appreciated that NASH significantly raises risk for
development of hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhosis, and acute liver failure as well as type 2 diabetes and
cardiovascular disease. However, there are currently no approved therapies for the treatment or reversal of
NASH. Our foundational work defining the molecular pathways linking disturbances in branched-chain amino
acid (BCAA) metabolism to the etiology of metabolic disease recently identified a novel regulatory node that
exerts a powerful influence on hepatic lipid deposition in obese and lean animals. We discovered that the
branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) kinase, BDK that inhibits branched-chain α-keto acid
(BCKA) oxidation robustly stimulates de novo lipogenesis (DNL), by phosphorylating the lipogenic enzyme ATP
citrate lyase (ACLY) on its activating serine. Likewise, we found that the BCKDH phosphatase, protein
phosphatase M1K (PPM1K), that promotes BCKA oxidation, dephosphorylates ACLY on its activating serine.
Accordingly, adenoviral mediated overexpression of BDK in liver of lean healthy Wistar rats was found to be
sufficient to raise hepatic DNL by 2.5 fold. Whereas, treatment of genetically obese Zucker Fatty rats with the
BDK inhibitor, BT-2, or adenovirus expressing recombinant PPM1K lowered circulating BCKA, reduced
phosphorylation of ACLY, and remarkably prompted a 40% reduction in liver triglyceride content in these
severely obese animals without altering food intake, body weight, adiposity, or physical activity. Subsequent,
studies in our lab have identified an additional effect of BT2 to lower expression of the fatty acid transporter,
CD36, in liver. Thus, our current working model is that modulation of the hepatic BCKA regulatory network exerts
robust effects on lipid content due to its dual effects on CD36-mediated lipid uptake and ACLY-mediated DNL.
Beyond these mechanisms, it remains unclear whether the BCKA themselves exert any direct or synergistic
effects on hepatic lipid metabolism. Importantly, our recent medRxiv preprint demonstrates that circulating BCKA
and liver BDK expression are strongly associated with NASH status in a cohort of 288 bariatric surgery patients
with severe obesity that are discordant for NAFLD and NASH. In the current proposal, we will leverage our
newly developed mouse models, established molecular/pharmacologic armamentarium, and novel insight to
resolve the molecular mechanisms connecting the BCKA regulatory network to the pathogenesis of NASH by
completing three specific aims: 1) Characterize the relative contribution of hepatic BDK, PPM1K, and BCKA to
NASH progression. 2) Evaluate the therapeutic potential of small molecule inhibitors of BDK for reversing NASH.
3) Define the mechanisms connecting the BCKA regulatory network to hepatic lipid content. The successful
completion of the studies outlined in specific aims 1-3 will define the BCKA regulatory network as an important
modulator of NASH progression with strong translation relevance for the treatment of NASH in humans."
10835847,"Occupational lung diseases are the primary cause of occupation-associated illness in the U.S. based on
frequency, severity, and preventability of the illnesses. Most occupational lung diseases are caused by repeated,
long-term exposure to hazardous agents, but even a severe single exposure can damage the lungs. There are
currently no medical therapies available to ameliorate lung injury/inflammation without exerting untoward side
effects. The inability to adequately treat workers following occupational inflammatory exposure leads to chronic
disease, and workers with respiratory disease have a higher incidence of filing for disability compared to those
without respiratory disease. Importantly, there is a re-emergence in traditional respiratory occupational hazards
caused by bacteria biological agents such as endotoxin. Exposures to endotoxin are high in agricultural
production and emerging sectors such as waste treatment, recycling, biotech food production and processing
industries. The COVID19 pandemic rapidly transpired as a devastating occupational respiratory viral-induced
health illness significantly impacting workers of food processing plants with limited efficacious therapies. Without
guidelines or therapies for the management of occupational exposure-induced lung injury/inflammation, there is
an urgent and unmet need to identify alternative approaches to reduce disease burden. Our long-term goal is to
find new strategies to promote the resolution of occupational exposure-associated lung inflammatory disease
before it progresses to irreversible lung disease. Our recent discoveries using single cell RNA sequencing
coupled with flow cytometry strongly implicate the recruited monocyte/macrophage, and we uncovered that
delivering amphiregulin and interleukin (IL)-10 as lung-directed therapies appear to beneficially effect lung
recovery processes post-occupational exposures. Our central hypothesis is that targeted cellular and mediator
interventional approaches following various occupational inflammatory inhalant exposures can be developed to
hasten lung recovery to reduce disease development. To model occupational bacterial and viral component-
induced lung inflammation, Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists and agriculture organic dust extract will be utilized.
We seek to test our hypothesis by addressing three independent and synergistic aims. In Aim 1, we will determine
the time-dependent cellular and specific monocyte/macrophage lung cell events following occupational
exposures and whether targeting these cells hastens lung recovery. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of
amphiregulin as a potential lung-directed therapeutic approach in the resolution inhalant occupational exposures.
In Aim 3, we will determine how inhalant IL-10 treatment works to promote repair in the recovery process after
lung inflammation induced by occupational exposures. The results of these studies will have an important
positive impact because they lay the pre-clinical groundwork for understanding key cellular and mediator
responses, and the ultimate development of new strategies to treat occupational exposure-induced lung
inflammation prior to the development of irreversible lung disease."

on the behavioral, biologic, and nutritional aspects of pediatric chronic illnesses and other nutrition-related
health issues. The Center’s T32 training program, funded by NIDDK in 2003, formalized cross-disciplinary
training at the postdoctoral level with the aim of training the next generation of academic leaders and
interdisciplinary team scientists. The training program integrates the expertise of faculty members across the
Divisions of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology; Endocrinology; Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and
Nutrition; Biostatistics and Epidemiology; Neurology; and the Department of Pediatric and Thoracic Surgery.
Trainees acquire: (1) expertise in the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric chronic medical
conditions in which dietary modification is a central component of disease management; (2) knowledge of
“state of the art” as well as innovative means of assessment of physical (e.g., body composition, bone mass,
disease progression), nutritional (e.g., via electronic data capture), and psychosocial (e.g., quality of life, family
functioning, functional behavior) status across the pediatric age range; and (3) knowledge of nutrition,
behavioral, and clinical trials science necessary to develop empirically-tested prevention models and clinical
interventions that improve dietary adherence, nutritional status, and long-term health and quality of life
outcomes for youth. Candidates have backgrounds in clinical psychology or pediatric medical subspecialties
(e.g., Endocrinology, Gastroenterology). The focal elements of the training program are mentored experiences
within interdisciplinary research teams with our NIH-funded faculty and guidance from a Scholarship Oversight
Committee. The mentored research experiences include the fellow’s participation as both an interdisciplinary
team member, as well as their initiation of a mentored interdisciplinary independent research project. Based on
the fellow’s prior educational pathway (PhD, MD), further training is obtained via practical and applied
experiences and engagement in didactics, seminars, and academic coursework tailored to an individual’s
training needs and career goals (e.g., behavioral science, nutrition science, clinical trials methodology,
advanced biostatistics, grant-writing, team science, responsible conduct of research, diversity, equity, and
inclusion, Masters Degree in Clinical and Translational Research). As evidenced by the excellent progress of
our program graduates, these training opportunities provide a solid foundation from which young clinical
researchers have already secured, and will continue to successfully transition to, faculty positions in the field of
academic medicine and emerge as leaders and team scientists involved in NIH-funded clinical research
programs that have a significant impact on future pediatric health outcomes. The current renewal application

at UT Southwestern Medical Center that provides M.D. and Ph.D. trainees with a firm basis in state-of-the-art
methodologies, in addition to preparing them for future academic careers in metabolism research. The program
under the auspices of this T32 has been running for the past 44 years. Established investigators from several
Departments and a number of Centers join forces to provide our trainees with a multi-facetted and diverse
training program. Participating Centers include the Touchstone Center for Diabetes Research, the Center for
Hypothalamic Research, the Center for Human Nutrition, the Advanced Imaging Research Center, the
McDermott Center for Human Genetics, Center for the Genetics of Host Defense and the Simmons Cancer
Center. Areas of expertise include systemic and cellular metabolism, diabetes, lipid biosynthesis, obesity, human
genetics related to metabolic disorders and tumor metabolism. Our T32 mentors direct highly competitive
research programs of national and international stature. Our trainees can take advantage of a very strong
research infrastructure that allows them to address physiological, biochemical and cell biological problems with
emerging technologies and the latest instrumentation. The 56 mentors are chosen from a tightly interwoven,
highly integrated group of investigators, which cover all of the relevant areas in metabolism research and a
number of sub-specialties in endocrine research. Metabolism research at UT Southwestern has flourished over
the past 15 years, due to the programmatic expansion over the previous period from 2007-2022. The school has
made a major commitment towards complementing existing areas of expertise by targeted recruitment of key
personnel to fill existing gaps over the past decade. Here, we build upon the historic strengths of our training
program, while taking advantage of the programmatic expansion experienced at UT Southwestern. This T32 is
an important cornerstone of metabolic research at UT Southwestern. We have implemented a number of
changes that have proven highly successful to further improve the quality of our training experience. During the
previous funding period (2018-2022), 7 trainees completed the program, or are currently in the program; most of
which have successfully applied for external funding. The current epidemic of obesity and its pathophysiological
sequelae is on an exponential rise. It is paramount to train the next generation of metabolism researchers and
endocrinologists to cope with this enormous public health problem, and further, to develop innovative approaches
to combat metabolic dysfunction. Furthermore, we now appreciate that we are facing a serious public health
issue in light of the fact that Covid-19 further increases the potential to become a type 2 diabetic risk if certain
factors are already present at the time of infection. We aim to train the next generation of researchers that will

10829887,"Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed tumor type and a common cause of cancer-related
deaths in women worldwide. In the US, African American (AA) and Hispanic/Latina women exhibit a
higher proportion of Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) than White or Asian women. In addition,
AA women have a higher risk of dying from, and being diagnosed with TNBC. Since TNBC is an
aggressive subtype with no available molecular targets and lack of immunotherapy, we have focused
our recent drug screens to identify compounds that are cytotoxic against these cells. Using a live-cell
imaging screening assay developed by my group, we recently screened 4,600 novel compounds from
the Chembridge DIVERset drug-like library of compounds on the MDA-MB-231 TNBC line and
detected fifteen compounds with significant cytotoxic activity against these cells. The most potent of
the compounds (a pyrazole-3-carbohydrazyde named P3C) was subsequently evaluated on additional
cancer cell lines and found to be cytotoxic to most cancer cell lines. A recent search for structural
analogues of P3C resulted in the identification of a compound (P3C.1) with stronger anti-cancer
activity than the original. Although P3C and P3C.1 have similar cytotoxic activity on a variety of cancer
cell lines, they also differ in activity on a small subset of cell lines. Our data indicate that they both
induce apoptosis via increased reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial depolarization, caspase
activation, cell membrane disruption, and DNA fragmentation. However, our preliminary results
indicate that the pyrazoles activate distinct signal transduction pathways. Our central hypothesis is
that the identified pyrazoles induce apoptosis via distinct pathways. Therefore, the main objective of
this project is to determine the mode of action (MOA) of each compound by comparing their gene
expression profiles and effects on key signal transduction pathways. Understanding the MOA of these
compounds is critical when testing compounds in clinical trials and in drug combination therapy. In
addition, an important goal of this proposal is to determine if the compounds reduce/inhibit tumor
progression in mice implanted with human tumors with the hope of eventually translating this basic
research into effective anticancer therapeutics that can help reduce cancer health disparities."

The Neuroscience Graduate Group (NGG) at the University of Pennsylvania is the home of a highly successful
Jointly Sponsored NIH Predoctoral Training Program in the Neurosciences, which we refer to as the
Neuroscience Training Grant (NTG), that is helping to prepare exceptional predoctoral students in their first two
years of graduate school for productive careers in basic neuroscience research and related fields. The NGG is
part of Biomedical Graduate Studies (BGS), which provides oversight and resources to ensure effective
curricular development, quality control, and uniform admission standards across all participating Graduate
Groups, including the NGG. Direct management of the NTG is provided by two highly experienced co-PIs, who
have complementary administrative roles and are also part of a five-person Executive Committee that sets and
reviews policy and selects trainees. NTG faculty come from 42 Departments in 7 Schools of the University of
Pennsylvania plus the affiliated Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Faculty membership is governed by: 1)
expertise in a relevant field of study, 2) significant contribution to training, 3) commitment to the goals of the
program, and 4) extramural funding to support trainees. Junior faculty receive extensive guidance on mentoring.
NTG students are selected from the highly talented pool of NGG students, based on scientific interests and
plans, academic achievement, and diversity. Support for each NTG trainee encompasses their first two years in
graduate school, during which time they complete two years of coursework plus at least two lab rotations before
settling into a dissertation laboratory. Trainees are active participants in numerous complementary activities that
provide training in the responsible conduct of research, scientific rigor and reproducibility, and quantitative
methodologies including faculty-led workshops and a newly developed Quantitative Neuroscience Core course.
Trainees also participate in seminars, journal clubs, annual retreats, scientific meetings, paper and poster
presentations, social events that encourage interactions, and other activities central to successful scientific
careers. At the end of their period of support, trainees complete a comprehensive Candidacy Examination that
marks the start of their independent dissertation research. Both during and after the period of NTG support,
trainees receive extensive mentoring and guidance to help them navigate the challenges of establishing their
independence as scientists. The NGG and NTG have a strong record of success in recruiting and retaining
diverse and talented trainees whose extensive accomplishments include high academic achievement,
substantial involvement in community outreach, publishing and presenting their research to broad audiences,
earning fellowships and awards, and going on to successful neuroscience-related careers. We request continued
support for 12 trainees per year (typically 6 first-year and 6 second-year students), so we can build on and extend
this history of success in helping to train the next generation of leaders in the field of neuroscience."
10812413,"The G protein-coupled chemokine receptor, CXCR4, and the atypical chemokine receptor, ACKR3, play critical
roles in cell migration during immune responses and organ development, through coordinated responses to a
shared ligand, CXCL12. Both receptors contribute to numerous inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and are
under active investigation as therapeutic targets. Nevertheless, there is currently only one FDA-approved
CXCR4 antagonist (AMD3100/Plerixafor), and its use is limited to mobilizing hematopoietic stem cells for bone
marrow transplants, because many of its properties are suboptimal. Therapeutic targeting of ACKR3 is at a less
mature stage than CXCR4; in fact, most known compounds are agonists, and it is unclear how to antagonize
this receptor. Improved compounds targeting both CXCR4 and ACKR3 are therefore needed.
As an ""atypical"" receptor, ACKR3 is widely assumed to function only through β-arrestin (and not G proteins), and
is best known for its ability to “scavenge” CXCL12 from the extracellular environment. By doing so, ACKR3
prevents downregulation of CXCR4 and maintains its responsiveness to CXCL12 gradients. When co-expressed
in the same cell, ACKR3 can also alter CXCR4 signaling and trafficking via heterodimerization, sequestration of
β-arrestin, and other as-yet-undeciphered mechanisms. Given that ACKR3 binds CXCL12 in an architecture
similar to CXCR4, undergoes similar conformational changes upon activation, and shares all of the conserved
G protein-coupling determinants, its presumed Gi incompetency is striking. Even more striking is the exceptional
robustness of ACKR3 activation to ligand and receptor modifications, whereas CXCR4 activation is abrogated
by the subtlest of such changes. Because of this activation-prone nature, most non-chemokine (and even small
molecule) ligands activate ACKR3 association with β-arrestin, with unknown downstream consequences.
Despite the role of the two receptors in disease, the structural and molecular mechanisms underlying their
individual functions and their cellular crosstalk remain elusive. In this MPI proposal, the Handel and Kufareva
labs combine their experimental and computational expertise, respectively, with their in-depth knowledge of
chemokine receptors, to explain the distinct activation mechanisms of CXCR4 (Aim 1) and ACKR3 (Aim 2) from
the standpoint of structure and dynamics, to understand how to inhibit these receptors (Aims 1 and 2), and to
understand how ACKR3 regulates the function of CXCR4 (Aim 3). To achieve these aims, specific mechanistic
hypotheses are probed with a combination of structural (cryo-EM and crystallography), computational (modeling
and MD) and cell-based functional experiments, and complemented by unbiased discovery proteomics. These
studies will deliver unprecedented insight into the function of CXCR4 and ACKR3, which will have a direct impact
on the development of small molecule therapeutics and provide the rationale for blocking one or both receptors.
By revealing general principles, the proposed studies will also advance the understanding and targeting of other
therapeutically important chemokine receptors, which are considered challenging targets."
10773627,"Project Summary
Isolation of specific and well-defined cell types to produce next generation cellular therapies remains a significant scale up
and scale out challenge for autologous and allogeneic therapies.
Through primary customer interviews of cell therapy developers, we learned there is an unmet need for scalable cell sorting
systems that can isolate rare cell types on multiple markers in production of nuanced cellular therapeutics. With preliminary
studies, we demonstrated that our scalable core technology (digital magnetic sorting) achieves superior rare cell isolation
and can achieve parallelized multitarget sorting to address this need.
In this proposal, we aim to develop a functionally closed, quantitative cell purification system that can isolate rare and
specific cell types based on multiple markers at throughputs conducive for cell therapy manufacturing."
10804690,"Development of a PCR assay for quantitative detection of HBV cccDNA
There is an urgent and unmet need for an effective method to detect hepatitis B virus
(HBV) cccDNA in the blood. HBV infection affects nearly 350 million people worldwide. Chronic
HBV infection is a major risk factor for the development of severe liver diseases such as cirrhosis
and hepatocellular carcinoma, which has a poor survival rate. Current therapies are effective
at suppressing viral replication. However, they do not eliminate the virus due to their inability
to eliminate the plasmid-like episome, covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) which can serve
as a template for the continuous generation of infectious viruses. This cccDNA, which resides
in the host nucleus, is generated from relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA), a partially double-
stranded DNA found in circulating virions and transmitted into the host hepatocytes. The
need to remove cccDNA to cure HBV infection has prompted drug discovery groups to focus
efforts on developing compounds that can target and eliminate cccDNA. Even with the ongoing
development of novel drugs, there is still an absence of a quantitative, specific, and reliable
cccDNA assay that is both highly sensitive for the detection of cccDNA in the blood, as well as
being specific enough to not detect rcDNA. The goal of this SBIR is to develop an innovative
and sensitive cccDNA assay that would be suitable for routine testing by physicians to manage
patients with chronic HBV infection and facilitate anti-HBV drug development. We have designed
such an assay, and our preliminary studies have indicated specific detection of 1,000 copies of
cccDNA and no detectable amplification of 10,000 copies of rcDNA. Two aims are proposed
in this phase I application. Aim 1 is to develop an innovative quantitative PCR assay that has
a sensitivity of 0.1% of cccDNA to rcDNA. Aim 2 is to perform assay validation with liver biopsies
and serial measurement of cccDNA from peripheral blood of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients
on therapy. In phase II, we will further develop and evaluate the assay to monitor therapeutic
efficacy."
10766709,"Project Summary Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions within the mammalian small intestine regulate stem cell
dynamics for accurate balance between cell proliferation and differentiation. Mesenchymal cells, particularly
fibroblasts, secrete signals to regulate epithelial cells, such as Wnt for epithelial growth and Bmp for epithelial
differentiation. However, how fibroblasts themselves are regulated remains unknown. Studying fibroblast biology
is critical, as fibroblasts can drive intestinal polyposis, which is a common gastrointestinal condition with epithelial
hyperproliferation linked to elevated risk of intestinal carcinogenesis. Human juvenile polyposis and hereditary
mixed polyposis syndromes are associated with germline mutations that lead to Bmp signaling loss. Despite
common feature of epithelial overgrowth in polyps, mouse studies have demonstrated that specific loss of Bmp
signaling from fibroblasts, not from intestinal epithelium, is sufficient to drive polyp formation. The mechanisms
by which Bmp signaling loss from fibroblasts drives uncontrolled epithelial growth in developing polyps remain
unclear. The overall objectives are to (i) determine the underlying fibroblast-driven mechanisms of epithelial
hyperproliferation upon Bmp signaling loss in Aim 1, and to (ii) define the role of Bmp signaling to fibroblast
identity specification and maintenance in Aim 2. To induce polyp formation, an inducible Bmp signaling loss-of-
function mouse model through overexpression of the Bmp antagonist Noggin is utilized. Strikingly, within three
days of Bmp signaling inhibition, the intestine first undergoes an architectural change, an ectopic tissue fold, that
does not involve epithelial hyperproliferation. Rather, epithelial proliferation only increases after several weeks
of Bmp signaling loss. My finding is the first to suggest the role of tissue architecture in regulating stem cell
dynamics and epithelial homeostasis. The central hypothesis is that alterations in specific subset(s) of intestinal
fibroblasts disrupt local tissue architecture, resulting in polyp formation. The long-term goal is to understand how
spatially segregated, unique fibroblast subtypes regulate tissue homeostasis and contribute to disease
pathogenesis. As my preliminary data demonstrate that fibroblasts mislocalize and accumulate towards stem
cells, coinciding with ectopic fold formation, Aim 1 will examine changes in fibroblast-secreted Wnt ligand
distribution within the epithelium, and whether these changes result in epithelial overgrowth in developing polyps.
This aim will deepen our foundational knowledge on dysregulated crosstalk between epithelial cells and niche
players in intestinal pathogenesis. Aim 2 will employ a spatial transcriptomic approach to examine the effects of
Bmp signaling loss to fibroblast gene expression profiles and localization during polyp initiation and progression.
It will reveal the requirements for Bmp signaling in specifying/maintaining fibroblast subtype identity and spatial
distribution in intestinal homeostasis, and that when disrupted, drives epithelial hyperproliferation in developing
polyps. Completion of this project will advance our knowledge on fibroblast regulation and stem cell niche
dynamics, which could lead to the identification of novel target cell types in preventing/treating intestinal cancers."
10771302,"Project Summary/Abstract
Caries is a near-ubiquitous infectious oral disease with an enormous direct and indirect impact on human health
care, well-being, workforce, and the economy. The quality and longevity of dental restorative interventions
depend largely on the integrity and biomechanical properties of dentin, the tooth’s bulk soft tissue that largely
consists of type I collagen and mineral. Formation and sustainability of the widely used resin-based restorations
rely on micro-mechanical adhesion to the collagenous dentin structures. Our interdisciplinary research team has
produced extensive evidence for the utility of oligomeric proanthocyanidins as novel bioactive materials sources
from plants. This body of data supports the feasibility of a biomimetic strategy that enhances the performance of
adhesive-based restorations. Insights gained from the underlying pre-clinical studies led to the recognition of
modular oligomeric plant phenols (MOPPs) as the common structural motif of compounds that interact with
structural proteins such as collagen. Supported by separate exploratory phytochemical and biomechanical
studies as well as considering structural characteristics, this project seeks to explore two biologically
understudied classes yet chemically diverse of MOPPs, stilbenoids from vascular plants and phloroglucinols
from ferns, as potentially promising additional leads. The core hypothesis is that medium-oligomeric stilbenoids
and phloroglucinols have analogous yet distinctly different structural characteristics that make these MOPPs
suitable for dentin biomodulation and orthogonal tools for biological/biomechanical studies. The overarching goal
is to extend the dentistry toolbox with previously un(der)explored structural classes of chemically diverse
biomodulators with modular build patterns.
Approaching the overall hypothesis at the dentistry-pharmacy interface, the two Aims reflect the phytoanalytical
and biomaterial angles of an interactive approach: (Aim 1) Source, purify, and characterize new modular
oligomeric plant phenols (MOPPs); (Aim 2) Establish and compare mechanisms of interactions of MOPPs with
human teeth constituents (enamel, dentin and pulp cells). Employing innovative purification and advanced
structural characterization methodologies for the complex MOPPs and performing their parallel state-of-the-art
biomechanical evaluation, the project has significant ability to harness the structural complexity and define the
utility and modular natural biomodulation agents. The potential to introduce natural modularity of MOPPs for
tailored biomodulatory therapeutics and enhance their clinical applicability are innovative aspects of the project.
The studies will build a solid phytochemical and biological foundation for the potential oral biomedical
applications of stilbenoids and phloroglucinols as underexplored bioactive agents. The ultimate project outcome
is the establishment of new classes of MOPPs as tissue biomodulators for future preclinical development."
10791769,"ABSTRACT: In 2017 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared the ongoing opioid epidemic
a public health crisis and more than 100,000 people died due to opioid overdose in 2021. A critical part of the
solution is to understand the fundamental reaction and adaptation of brain circuits to stimulation by opioids. For
example, the desensitization of opioid receptors is a critical problem in pain management because it requires
increasing doses of analgesic compounds, which could contribute to developing a drug addiction. Recently, it
has been shown that the activation of mu and kappa opioid receptors in neurons causes the production of
reactive oxygen species (ROS) through a pathway involving NADPH oxidase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase.
Therefore, this distinct response, downstream from the receptor, could be utilized to detect specific opioid
receptor activation and modulation. However, we currently lack sensitive fluorescent sensors, which would allow
us to directly monitor pathways downstream from mu-opioid receptor (MOR) activation in real-time. Current
limitations of contemporary sensors are slow response time, low specificity, low signal output, low brightness,
and toxicity. My goal is to develop a genetically encoded sensor protein that detects ROS levels at
endogenous levels with response time and signal amplitudes that will enable monitoring of neuronal
systems upon MOR activation in brain tissue. I have developed a novel fluorescent ROS sensor with
significantly improved signaling amplitude, sensitivity, and response kinetics compared to previous sensors. I
used a newly identified insertion site on OxyR, a bacterial hydrogen peroxide binding protein, that putatively
improved allosteric coupling to the fluorescent reporter domain. We will increase the fidelity of this tool with new
green fluorescent protein (AausFP1) that exhibits exceptional quantum yield and brightness. I will optimize a
new ROS sensor at an unprecedented rate through a multifaceted approach that combines rational,
computational, and evolutionary protein engineering. My objective is to express this novel tool in MOR positive
neurons and to link ROS signals to MOR activity pharmacologically. I hypothesize that ROS signals in MOR
neurons will increase under morphine but not fentanyl through a pathway including c-Jun N-terminal Kinase,
Peroxiredoxin 6 and NADPH oxidase. Furthermore, I hypothesize that we will observe a decrease in ROS
transients under repeated drug exposure reflecting the desensitization of MORs. At the end, I will have a novel
and highly specific sensor for monitoring opioid receptor activity and adaptivity. My proposal is significant
because, for the first time, we will be able to monitor the adaptation of this clinically relevant signaling pathway
to opioid exposure. My approach is innovative because it combines novel protein engineering and monitoring
of opioid-triggered signals to dissect a difficult-to-access neuronal signaling pathway. Furthermore, this approach
could be broadly applied in future studies to monitor the activity of opioid receptors during drug exposure and
link the subsequent changes in neuronal signaling and plasticity to motivated behaviors, or analgesic tolerance."
10747337,"Project Summary
Staphylococcus aureus is a common human pathogen responsible for infections that are notoriously difficult to
resolve and associated with high rates of treatment failure. As the rise of antibiotic resistance for this pathogen
is quickly depleting treatment options, there is a critical need to identify factors which improve antibiotic efficacy
in order to decrease the rates of treatment failure and slow the development of resistance. By furthering our
understanding of how antibiotics work within the host environment, as well as identifying factors which
influence antibiotic efficacy, we should be able to reduce the rate of treatment failure for S. aureus infections.
Our preliminary data shows that manganese limitation potentiates the antibiotic killing of cell-wall acting
antibiotics. Furthermore, cultures grown in low-manganese conditions showed increased activity of autolysins,
enzymes important in peptidoglycan breakdown and cell wall homeostasis. Importantly, during host invasion,
essential metals such as manganese are limited from the pathogen through action of the host protein
calprotectin, which serves to limit pathogen spread and control infection.
We hypothesize that Mn limitation results in decreased negative regulation of autolysins, leading to increased
autolysin activity and increased susceptibility to cell-wall acting antibiotics. We predict that manganese
sequestration by the host sensitizes S. aureus to cell-wall acting antibiotics and that by limiting Mn consumed
through the diet of the host, we can increase the efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of S. aureus infections.
In Aim 1 we will elucidate the mechanism of antibiotic potentiation as driven by manganese limitation and in
Aim 2 we will examine the effect of manganese limitation on antibiotic treatment success in murine bacteremia
and skin wound models. Completion of these aims will determine the role of manganese availability in antibiotic
effectivity. The significance of this project stems from the need to understand how antibiotics work within the
host and how antibiotic efficacy can be improved to decrease treatment failure and slow the development of
resistance. The insight gained from the completion of this research project will contribute towards a greater
understanding of how host-associated factors influence antibiotic treatment.
The research and training plan detailed in this proposal will integrate the study of host-microbe interactions
with the study of antibiotic treatment, providing me the opportunity to develop advanced technical skills in
microbiology, the design of experiments, and data analysis. As my future goals include subspecializing in
infectious disease and working in the field of host-microbe interactions, this proposal will aid in my
development of the skill set necessary to become a successful mentor, teacher, and physician-scientist,
conducting research in microbiology that has the potential to positively impact patient care."
10784764,"Summary/Abstract
 The dominant paradigm in social visual neuroscience has been to present simplified stimuli, often
consisting of static images in isolation presented without context, passively, to subjects required to maintain gaze
fixation. While much has been learned using this paradigm, it cannot capture all aspects of how social vision (SV)
works. Specifically, active observers combine motoric information gathering behaviors (eye and head movement)
to optimally sample perceptual information in a complex, natural multisensory social environment. Indeed, there
are few places where active vision is more critical than in the study of the neurobiology of SV. Real world SV is a
prototypic active sensing process where we use our experience, along with all of our sensing and interpretive
capacities to gather social and affective information from other people in a complex and dynamic setting. Simply
put, SV, as typically studied, does not adequately approximate actively interacting with friends, family, or your
doctor. Recent advances in computer vision, machine learning, and computational analysis now provide means
to attack a critical goal of social neuroscience: how the social and affective system guides active information
gathering in natural social contexts. We propose a novel natural approach to studying SV.
 This project will leverage a powerful technique to measure activity in the human brain: direct recording
from electrodes implanted in the brains of surgical epilepsy patients. Surgical epilepsy patients who spend 1-2
weeks in the hospital while having their brain activity monitored afford the unique opportunity to record
multiscale neural activity during natural interactions with friends, family, doctors, nurses, experimenters, etc. In
addition, patients will play a social game to allow for the study of real world SV using a semi-controlled and
repeatable task. Furthermore, participants will engage in more standard laboratory SV paradigms to assess how
results from real world conditions compare to the results from traditional experiments. The neural recordings
will be acquired simultaneously with video and audio monitoring, and eye tracking. State-of-the-art computer
vision analysis will provide a continuous assessment of social cues (e.g., eye gaze and facial expression) from
people with whom the patients are interacting. Computational analyses and mechanistic neural measurements
will determine the correspondence between what is perceived by the patient, the neural coding, and the
neurobiological implementation of that code. This approach will allow us to bridge across three critical levels of
analysis required for understanding the SV information processing systems. We hypothesize that real world SV
is an extended, iterative process that combines active, dynamic motor/attentional sampling strategies with prior
and contextual information to actively plan information gathering, which both enables and constrains the flow
of information through the system. Our results will have fundamental implications both for basic social
neuroscience and for our understanding of how these processes may be altered in disorders of SV, such as mood
and anxiety disorders and schizophrenia."

Synucleinopathies are a major public health risk, with millions of people each year affected by Parkinson disease,
Parkinson disease with dementia (PDD), Lewy Body dementia, and multiple system atrophy. These diseases
impact both motor and cognitive function, for which there are no known cures and limited therapeutic options. It
is therefore vital to determine the disease etiology, which is hypothesized to arise from the misfolding and
aggregation of the protein α-synuclein into fibrils. The in vivo structural forms of these pathogenic fibrils will help
to understand mechanisms of misfolding and aid in the development of imaging ligands with higher structure-
specific binding. I will use solid state NMR (SSNMR) in combination with cryo-EM/ET to determine the structures
of patient derived in vivo PDD fibrils. I will then investigate how in vivo fibril quaternary structure governs the
stability and dynamics of mature diseased state fibrils and its effects on the aggregation pathway of α-synuclein
fibrils. I will also investigate the interactions of imaging ligands to these fibrils to determine the structural motifs
these compounds bind to by comparing binding site structure between in vitro and in vivo fibril preparations.
Training plan: I have a considerable amount of research experience with SSNMR of membrane proteins, and I
will add training in SSNMR methods required for structure determination of fibrils structures using novel
approaches combining simulated annealing and molecular dynamics with cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM),
cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) and SSNMR data. The National Magnetic Resonance Facility at Madison
(NMRFAM) provides a world-leading environment for training with access to high field SSNMR spectrometers
(600 to 900 MHz) and an ultra-high field (1.1 GHz) SSNMR spectrometer arriving in 2023. The infrastructure
here will allow me to make new discoveries to both structure and dynamics of diseased fibrils and their
interactions with imaging ligands. Furthermore, I will gain training in cryo-ET to obtain complementary data such
as fibril width, twist, mass-per-unit length, and utilize cryo-EM to solve structures jointly with SSNMR to atomic
resolution. These findings will be disseminated to the larger scientific community via publications and talks given
at interdisciplinary meetings. My training will take place under Prof. Chad Rienstra, an internationally recognized
leader in the field of biomolecular SSNMR, who has mentored dozens of graduate students and postdocs, many
of whom are faculty members at top tier institutions. Environment: The University of Wisconsin-Madison is a
highly ranked research university, with among the best environments available in the world for structural biology,
with NMRFAM, the Cryo-EM Research Center, and the Center for High Throughput Computing. Prof. Katherine
Henzler-Wildman, co-director of NMRFAM with Prof. Rienstra, has a strong background in insoluble protein
structure and dynamics. Close collaboration with the cryo-EM group of Prof. Timothy Grant on fibril structure
determination will be an added capability. The excellent research environment at UW-Madison with Prof.
Rienstra will prepare me to be a future leader in structural biology and biophysics of complex biomolecules."
10816991,"Project Summary
Bacteria are most commonly found in nature in multicellular communities termed biofilms. Biofilms are formed
when bacteria synthesize, secrete, and enmesh themselves with diverse biopolymers. Beneficial bacteria in the
microbiome assemble biofilms, while biofilms are unfortunately also linked to difficult-to-treat infections that
exhibit increased tolerance to antibacterials and can exhaust treatment options. However, there are no blueprints
for how bacteria build these tissue-like architectures and uncovering these details can accelerate discovery of
new anti-infectives. E. coli, in particular, are normal residents in the healthy microbiome, but emerge as
pathogens when they egress and colonize the urinary tract. E. coli, Salmonella species and other Gram-negative
organisms harness specific amyloid and polysaccharide machinery to elaborate mechanically robust
extracellular matrix architectures resembling baskets and blankets that surround cells and drive the formation of
tissue-like biofilms. Due to the complexity of biopolymer composites, there are significant challenges associated
with studying their structure and function, yet the ubiquity of these biopolymers makes them of high importance
for study. This research plan is directed to test molecular hypotheses for how bacteria employ curli and
phosphoethanolamine cellulose, a newly discovered chemically modified form of cellulose, to enmesh
themselves in extracellular matrix (ECM). The research plan will test hypotheses regarding functional roles that
we propose are ascribed to the zwitterionic phosphoethanolamine modification. Aim 1 is directed to evaluate the
temporal and spatial developments of matrix assembly beyond the bacterial cell surface using fluorescence
microscopy and creative functional biochemical assays. Aim 2 will implement a strategically designed solid-state
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) approach to detect molecular contacts between polysaccharides and protein
amyloids that are responsible for matrix cohesion. The functional benefit of ECM biopolymers will be determined
in Aim 3, where clinically relevant antibiotics and a novel vancomycin-conjugate will be evaluated for efficacy
against pEtN cellulose and curli containing biofilms. This work promises to formulate a molecular foundation for
future avenues of inquiry at the host-pathogen interface, involving possible immunomodulatory roles of bacterial
polysaccharides and amyloids, and possible biopolymer contributions to microbiome symbiosis and amyloid-
associated disease pathologies. The fellowship candidate will receive significant training in solid-state NMR
spectroscopy to study molecular interactions within E. coli biofilms and biochemical approaches to investigate
bacterial communities. The considerable support and mentorship structure provided through this fellowship, the
research sponsor (Prof. Lynette Cegelski) and institution (Stanford University) will facilitate the professional
development of the fellowship applicant and the rigorous scientific investigation of the proposed research."
10833081,"Project Summary:
Neural circuits in the spinal cord serve as the conduit through which the nervous system controls muscle
contraction to implement behavior. Defining spinal circuit organization is therefore central to understanding
the neural control of movement. One major challenge in resolving how spinal circuits direct motor output is
the highly heterogeneous nature of spinal interneurons, which shape fundamental elements of limb movement
underlying locomotion and skilled forelimb behaviors. Because our ability to resolve distinct interneuron cell
types remains limited, little is known about the synaptic and circuit organization of spinal interneurons or their
functional contributions to motor output. We recently discovered that spinal V1 interneurons, the largest
inhibitory interneuron population in the spinal motor system, constitute a molecularly heterogeneous group
that can be segregated into at least four mutually exclusive subsets (clades) defined by expression of the
transcription factors Foxp2, MafA, Pou6f2, and Sp8. V1 clades exhibit restricted and highly stereotyped
positions in the spinal cord, and several show distinct electrophysiological signatures. As such, V1
interneurons represent an ideal system in which to explore general principles of interneuron identity and
circuitry governing motor output, of relevance to other classes of spinal interneurons. Motivated by our
discovery of V1 interneuron diversity, this proposal aims to (1) define the molecular and cellular identity of
these clades and the mechanisms through which this diversity arises, (2) test the hypothesis that descending
motor pathways from the brain differentially innervate V1 clades, and (3) investigate how V1 interneurons
influence one key aspect of motor control – the speed of rhythmic locomotor output. Together, the proposed
experiments address a fundamental gap in knowledge about the identity, circuit organization, and function of
interneurons in the spinal motor system, and serve as a foundation for future efforts aimed at dissecting the
contributions of specific interneuron cell types to motor behavior, of relevance for developmental motor
disorders and spinal cord injury."
10813156,"Project Summary/Abstract
Combining isotopic labeling and gas cluster ion beam surface ionization mass spectrometry (GCIB-SIMS), we
found the purinosome metabolon consists of nine enzymes that channel phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate to
AMP and GMP. The metabolon greatly increases the pathway flux and unexpectedly favors partitioning of IMP
to AMP. Chemical imaging of the cell revealed “hot spots” of these metabolites. We presume that these are
located at the microtubule/mitochondrion interface based on temporal fluorescent imaging that found a
directional movement of the purinosome along the microtubules to the mitochondria. We uncovered two
mechanisms that govern purinosome assembly. One involves the participation of the chaperones HSP90/70
that act to fold two nascent enzymes prior to their incorporation into the purinosome. A second involves the
multiple phosphorylation that occurs on the majority of the pathway enzymes upon purinosome assembly. We
plan to exploit the unique isotopic labeling pattern that signals the presence of a functional purinosome to
survey human cell lines to ascertain the generality of this metabolon at endogenous levels. By extending our
chemical imaging capabilities, we will show that the cellular “hot spots” are loci of the pathway enzymes and
their respective metabolites. The determination of the actual number of enzyme copies within a purinosome will
be undertaken with a novel application of STORM. The actual organization of the metabolon will be probed by
a combination of intracellular photo- and enzyme- specific crosslinking. We will resort to APEX to validate the
identity of nearest neighbors within the purinosome and to discover other adjacent proteins that emanate from
nearby structures such as the mitochondrial membrane. Through a collaborative effort, cell lines that use a
functioning purinosome for purine synthesis will be examined in cells and in xenografts to ascertain the
metabolic requirements and the advantage of the metabolon for cellular proliferation. The proposed studies
have important ramifications for characterizing the importance of the purinosome to human cell viability."

Hepatoblastoma (HB) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are the most frequently diagnosed liver tumors in
children, with HBs most commonly present in young children less than 5 years of age, and HCCs are more
commonly seen in adolescents. HB- and HCC-patient outcomes and treatment options vary dramatically, with
5-year overall survival rates of over 70% for HB and under 30% for HCC patients. While a combination of
chemotherapy and surgery is effective for lower-risk HBs, 3-year overall survival for high-risk HBs is 50%. High-
dose chemotherapy, which is often ineffective for high-risk HBs, is associated with significant morbidity.
Complete surgical resection is the only chance for a cure for HCC. Molecular biomarkers can help optimize
treatments for patients that will not benefit from chemotherapy or that do not require high dosage chemotherapy
and identify patients that require a combination of aggressive surgery and chemotherapy.
In previous work, we, and our collaborators, identified prognostic biomarkers that distinguish between low- and
high-risk HBs at diagnosis. We proposed and retrospectively evaluated predictive models to classify patients
based on risk—including their need for aggressive therapies. These models identify patients that do not require
aggressive therapies, patients that will benefit from aggressive therapies, and patients with tumors that are more
likely to metastasize and become resistant to chemotherapy. We developed and certified molecular assays to
profile patients and tumors for predictive biomarker used by these models. Here, we propose to prospectively
validate these biomarkers, assays, and models to produce the first validated platform for the molecular diagnosis
and therapy choice for HBs and HCC. We will benefit from a close collaboration with clinical-trial produced data
in the USA and EU, including AHEP1531 (USA), ChILTERN (EU) and iPC (a EU-USA collaboration)."
10789913,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β-cells. Potential therapeutic
approaches to curtail or reverse the loss of β-cells include immune modulation, β-cell regeneration, or
combinations thereof. There has been substantial preclinical development of therapies that stimulate human β-
cell replication. However, absolute proliferation rates induced by such drugs remain relatively low, and it is
unclear whether current approaches will sufficiently expand β-cell numbers to control blood glucose without
exogenous insulin. Here, we build upon emerging evidence that cell metabolism supports proliferation to identify
and exploit metabolic bottlenecks that limit therapeutic β-cell expansion. Proliferating cells are known to activate
metabolic programs that produce cellular building blocks and generate signals that support cell division. In
preliminary data, we found that the metabolic enzyme ATP-citrate lyase (Acly) is required for expansion of
transformed β-cells. Other groups have shown that pancreatic deletion of Acly results in smaller islets, consistent
with a role for this enzyme in β-cell proliferation. Acly acts upon citrate to produce acetyl-CoA, which is a
substrate for lipid synthesis and histone acetylation. In this way, Acly couples mitochondrial metabolism to
production of cellular building blocks and signaling via the epigenome. In β-cells, Acly deletion results in
downregulation of lipid synthesis genes concomitant with reduced histone acetylation of their associated
regulatory elements, suggesting Acly regulates lipid synthesis through dual metabolic and epigenetic
mechanisms. Together, these observations build the model that Acly produces both anabolic and signaling
metabolites that support β-cell proliferation. We found that Acly is phosphorylated by mitogenic signals,
suggesting it could be activated during β-cell proliferation to drive requisite changes in metabolism. Our central
hypothesis is that mitogens remodel β-cell lipid metabolism through Acly, and that this effect is necessary for
optimal β-cell proliferation. Here, we will test how changes to islet lipid metabolism support β-cell proliferation in
primary human islets using genetic or metabolic interventions coupled with targeted metabolomics and genomic
assays. In Aim 1, we will monitor the effect of pro-proliferative drugs on islet lipid synthesis and test whether
metabolites affected by mitogenic signals limit β-cell proliferation. To assess the requirement for lipid synthesis
pathways downstream of Acly, we will determine how ACLY inactivation impacts human β-cell proliferation under
the same conditions. In Aim 2, we will assess how the islet epigenome is remodeled in response to β-cell
mitogens. Islets will be treated with pro-proliferative drug combinations, then we will perform ChIP-seq for histone
modifications previously implicated in governing β-cell proliferation. We will also determine the epigenetic
signaling function of Acly by testing its role in nutrient-stimulated histone acetylation in human islets.
Understanding the metabolic pathways that support or augment pharmacological β-cell expansion could inform
nutritional interventions to optimize β-cell regeneration by therapies currently in preclinical development."
10775740,"Current physical activity (PA) interventions for persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) focus primarily on reducing the debilitating symptom of dyspnea or shortness of breath. However,
over half of patients with COPD experience chronic musculoskeletal pain which limits achievement of PA goals
and optimization of physical function. Low PA is associated with poor outcomes–increased risk of COPD acute
exacerbations, hospitalizations, and death–independent of lung function. Funded by Rehabilitation R&D, we
have developed Every Step Counts (ESC), a web-based intervention to promote PA in Veterans with COPD.
ESC couples a dynamic website with a pedometer that objectively monitors daily step counts. Based on the
Behavioral Theory of Self-Regulation, the website provides individualized step-count goals, iterative feedback,
education on disease self-management, motivation, and an online community of social support. In RCTs, we
have demonstrated ESC’s safety, feasibility, and efficacy to increase PA over 3-6 months. However, not all
participants increased daily step counts. In secondary analyses, we identified pain as a significant barrier to
PA. Participants with co-occurring pain and dyspnea walked 1,200-1,400 fewer steps per day, compared to
those with no symptoms. In its current form, ESC does not focus on pain management. Tai Chi (TC) is an
attractive nonpharmacologic treatment for chronic musculoskeletal pain. TC improves neuromuscular function,
core strength, and lower limb proprioception. Importantly, the mindfulness embedded in TC uniquely addresses
cognitive and psycho-emotional processes critical for pain management (i.e., “extinction of fear conditioning,
acceptance-based coping strategies, increased ability to self-regulate affective appraisal of nociceptive input,”
and reduced pain-related distress and catastrophizing). We have shown that persons with COPD can safely
engage with TC delivered via either in-person classes or video instruction. We propose to integrate ESC and
TC to target biopsychosocial mechanisms of pain to break the chronic pain cycle and improve physical function
in persons with COPD. We will adapt ESC with pain management content, an online TC video library, and
synchronous TC classes led by an instructor via teleconference. We will randomize participants 1:1 to ESC-TC
or usual care for 6 months. Assessments of outcomes will occur at baseline, 2, 4, and 6 months in all
participants, and at 12 months in a subset who enroll early. Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of the ESC-TC
intervention in 136 persons with COPD and chronic musculoskeletal pain to improve the primary outcome of
physical function, measured by daily step count, compared to usual care at 6 months. Aim 2: Evaluate the
effect of the ESC-TC intervention on secondary outcomes of (a) pain intensity and interference, (b) dyspnea,
(c) health-related quality of life, (d) mobility, (e) depression and anxiety, (f) exercise self-efficacy, (g)
kinesiophobia, (h) pain catastrophizing, and (i) sleep quality. Aim 3: Explore the long-term effects of ESC-TC
on symptoms and risk of acute exacerbations and COPD-related hospitalizations at 12 months in
approximately 96 participants. Our innovative multimodal, web-based, non-pharmacologic intervention to treat
chronic musculoskeletal pain has potential to expand access to exercise as a rehabilitation strategy."
10907434,"Alcohol-induced changes in gut flora and intestinal metabolites increase portal endotoxin level, which is directly
associated with intestinal barrier dysfunction and is one of the well-recognized contributing factors to the
pathogenesis of ALD. Gut fucosylation is a key force in maintaining a homeostatic relationship between the gut
and its microbiota. Nevertheless, it is unclear how host fucosylation machinery contributes to alcohol-associated
barrier function and microbial translocation. It is shown that epithelial α1,2-fucosylation regulates the colonization
of E. faecalis, which causes more severe alcoholic hepatitis. Our initial studies found that alcohol consumption
reduces the levels of neurons-derived peptide VIP in the gut. Neuropeptide VIP has previously been implicated
in circadian regulation, food consumption and goblet cell mucus secretion. Our preliminary data further found
that neuropeptide VIP administration or deletion of VIP receptor (VIPR1) can regulate intestinal fucosylation.
Membrane-bound fucosylated glycoproteins on mucosal ECs function as important communication tools
between the host and luminal microbes. Many intestinal Bifidobacteria use α1,2-L-fucosidases to ferment the
glycans of host glycoconjugates to produce fucose for its colonization. We found that fucose-derived propionate
could contribute to the induction of IL-22 producing group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), which can regulate
epithelial integrity in ALD. Therefore, we hypothesize that a high amount of alcohol consumption is
associated with disturbances in gut VIP secretion, reductions in IECs fucosylation and beneficial
symbionts, and subsequently overgrowth of cytolysin-positive E. faecalis, all of which lead to intestinal
barrier dysfunction and contribute to the development of ALD. We postulate that prebiotic and probiotic
supplementation will attenuate alcohol-induced intestine and liver injury, in part by inhibiting of E.
faecalis colonization and increasing IL-22+ ILC3 in the intestine. Following specific aims will be carried out:
Aim 1: Determine the impact of VIP signaling on the gut fucosylation and the effects of this impact on intestinal
barrier integrity in ALD. We will document the impact of VIP/VIPR1 signaling changes on intestinal fucosylation
and integrity in ALD; We will explore the mechanisms by which fucosylation is enhanced by VIP. Aim 2:
Investigate whether probiotic fucosidase-producing Bifidobacterium attenuates ALD via inhibition of E. faecalis
colonization and activation of IL-22+ILC3. We will examine the effect of fucosidase-producing Bifidobacterium
and fucose-derived propionate on E. faecalis colonization; We will investigate whether fucosidase-producing
Bifidobacterium attenuates ALD via the activation of gut ILC3 and IL-22/ IL-22RA signaling. Aim 3: Evaluate the
efficacy of VIP-fucosylation-based therapeutic interventions in ALD. We will first evaluate and compare the
efficacy of dietary prebiotic 2'-FL with VIP supplementation in the treatment of experimental ALD. We will also
determine the effect of metabolite propionate treatment with/without dietary 2'-FL supplementation on ALD in
WT mice or ILC3-deficient mice. We propose that exploiting this mechanism will allow the design of novel
strategies to manipulate these forces to increase barrier function and/or prevent/delay the development of ALD."
10917042,"Black Americans are more likely to receive care in lower quality hospitals that confer worse health outcomes to
patients. The intractable hospital outcomes disparities have been described for decades and most recently
came to the forefront of public attention with COVID-19 mortality disproportionally affecting Black communities.
Despite multiple studies which attribute a large share of outcome disparities to quality differences in hospitals
where significant proportions of Black patients are treated (i.e., Black-serving hospitals), little is known about
what modifiable factors underlie the poorer quality care. This proposal takes a multilevel perspective to identify
the contributions of individual, social, and hospital determinants to identify modifiable factors that can be
targeted through `upstream' interventions to achieve health equity for Black individuals. We hypothesize that
disparities in hospital outcomes are due, in large part, to inequities in the modifiable nurse resources of
hospitals—with fewer nurse resources in Black-serving hospitals. This uneven distribution of nurse resources
is a vestige of racism that continues to pervade hospital care more than 50 years after the legal desegregation
of hospitals. We focus on nurse resources, since having enough nursing staff to deliver timely and effective
care, a favorable work environment in which nurses have clinical autonomy in their practice and strong
interdisciplinary teamwork, a skill mix rich in registered nurses, and high proportions of bachelors-prepared
nurses and advanced practice nurses, have all been associated with better patient outcomes, particularly for
minority patients. In this study, we evaluate the impact of hospital-level differences in nurse resources on
patient outcomes, including in-hospital and 30-day mortality, readmission, and hospital length of stay. This
observational study of over 900,000 older adult patients in nearly 250 hospitals investigates (1) whether
differences in nurse resources between Black-serving and other hospitals explain outcomes disparities; (2)
whether the outcomes-advantages of having superior hospital nurse resources are enhanced in the presence
of other hospital characteristics, including for example, physician staffing, greater numbers of APRNs, or
teaching hospitals; and (3) estimates the improvements in patient outcomes, such as lives saved, that could be
expected if nurse resources in Black-serving hospitals were similar to other hospitals. Nurse resources are
measured using survey data from over 16,000 nurses in nearly 250 hospitals to describe multiple aspects of
the clinical nurse resources. Using a unique hospital identifier, nurse responses will be linked with Medicare
patient records, demographic and social determinant of health indices. Our analytic approach uses multi-level
nested (hierarchically-related) linear and logistic regression models (with interaction terms) to accomplish our
aims. If our hypotheses are confirmed, the findings will add evidence to inform high-impact actionable
`upstream' solutions to dismantle structural remnants of racism that pervade our healthcare system, by
leveraging the most abundant patient care resource already existing in every hospital—nurses."

a lack of genetic markers. Our lab has mapped mesothelial progenitors to the lateral plate mesoderm expressing
the transcription factor Hand2, and further linked Hand2 function to mesothelium and pericardium formation.
These conceptual and technical advances in mesothelial biology enable us to investigate how pericardial and
cardiac structures come together to form a single functional organ system during development. My expansion of
this data suggests that pericardial and cardiac progenitors are distinct progenitor populations that later come
together to fuse together during embryogenesis. The objective of this proposal is to uncover the developmental
mechanisms governing progenitor patterning into the heart and pericardium and identify the role of canonical
Wnt signaling that controls the pericardial emergence. In Aim 1, I will use a combination of transgenic zebrafish
lines that label the developing heart and pericardium, in vivo time-lapse imaging, stable genetic knockdowns of
cardiac components, and multi-color lineage tracing reporters to examine the cellular origins and dynamics of
the developing pericardium. In Aim 2, I will investigate the interplay between Hand2 and canonical Wnt signaling
by documenting the expression dynamics of Wnt targets in Hand2 mutant zebrafish, overexpressing Wnt
components, and using CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis to mutate Hand2 binding sites. Together, this project will be
the first to fully characterize how pericardial development proceeds and incorporates the heart and the interplay
between Hand2 and canonical Wnt signaling in controlling pericardium development."

The Community Engagement Core (CEC) is a vital part of the Center for Environmental Health and Justice in
Northern Manhattan (CEHJNM). Since its inception, the CEC has promoted multidirectional communication
between CEHJNM members and the communities we serve, ensuring the Center is responsive to and aligned
with community needs. Our CEC is grounded in a deep, meaningful, and fruitful history of collaboration with
our primary partner organization, WE ACT for Environmental Justice (WE ACT). Through these collaborations,
our CEC has engaged in impactful community-based research and dissemination activities on multiple
environmental justice concerns including housing, air pollution, chemical exposures from beauty products, and
others. In this renewal, the CEC seeks to extend our work by building new partnerships and expanding
capacity to address ongoing and emerging environmental justice and public health concerns using
community-engaged research and innovative dissemination and engagement methods.
Community groups and environmental health researchers need to be equipped with the research skills and
engagement strategies to overcome longstanding hurdles to meaningful collaborations that focus on
community needs, leverage expertise and assets from community and academic partners, and jointly serve the
goals of achieving an equitable and just society where health disparities and environmental burdens are no
longer the norm. The goal of the CEC is to promote multidirectional communication between the CEHJNM and
community to ensure the Center is responsive to and aligned with community needs. The proposed efforts of
the CEC will fill several critical gaps: 1) identify emerging environmental health and justice (EHJ) issues in the
New York City area; 2) enlist environmental health researchers with a range of relevant skills and interests to
engage in collaborative, community-based research with translational potential; 3) train community members to
participate in environmental health research and translational activities; and 4) support STEM curriculum in
local schools to build a pipeline to college and EHJ careers among local youth.
The CEC proposes two main aims. The first aim is to enhance regional collaborations and networking in
environmental health and justice by establishing a publicly available database of stakeholders in the
New York area. Our second aim entails training and capacity building to advance environmental health
and justice literacy as well as collaborative research and action in the community. As part of this aim, we will
implement an Environmental Health and Justice Academy (EHJA) to train researchers, community
members and youth on the tenets of collaborative research, dissemination, and policy translation. We also
seek to increase environmental health and justice literacy of multiple stakeholders by broadly
disseminating the voices, stories, and research of EHJA trainees through multi-media platforms. Furthermore,
we will identify new EHJ foci and opportunities for strategic action by supporting collaborative projects."
10851731,"SUMMARY – PILOT PROJECT PROGRAM (PPP)
The goal of the Pilot Project Program (PPP) of the Center for Environmental Health and Justice in Northern
Manhattan (CEHJNM) is to provide seed funding and intellectual support to outstanding new research ideas
from existing members and potential new members. The PPP provides funding for research (≤$35K for full pilot
projects and ≤$10K for mini-pilots), access to CEHJNM state-of-the-art facility cores (FCs), and research
design, grant preparation, and intellectual support. The PPP specifically promotes projects that interact with
our local communities. We prioritize applications from (a) early-career faculty; (b) teams led by and/or including
scientists in key roles from groups historically underrepresented in science and academia; (c) faculty who are
not yet CEHJNM members. Funding advances our understanding of the health impacts of environmental
exposures with a focus on CEHJNM’s five scientific directions: Environmental Justice, Advancing the
Exposome, Environmental Data Science, Biological and Molecular Mechanisms, and Climate and Health. In
addition to supporting CEHJNM’s current directions, the PPP also encourages the development of research
outside of those directions as a way to develop novel areas of focus.
Over the lifetime of the CEHJNM, the PPP has been an extraordinary success. Between 2013 and 2021, the
PPP received 115 pilot proposals, of which 52 were funded. PPP awardees included investigators from 19
different departments across Columbia University (CU), thus fostering the development of new interdisciplinary
collaboration and the expansion of the CEHJNM community. More importantly, the PPP seeded novel ideas
that significantly advanced the impact of CEHJNM’s research. Innovations for this funding cycle include a new
funding mechanism, a change in leadership, and new review criteria to promote diversity. We will introduce a
new category of full-pilot awards, the Cross-Disciplinary Linked Pilots (Linked Pilots) soliciting two coordinated
pilot applications (≤$35K each) linking a mechanistic pilot to a human study. The PPP leadership now includes
a population scientist (Factor-Litvak) and a laboratory scientist (Re) to help support a full range of applications.
We will also modify our scoring criteria to formally include the diversity of the applicant team in the review
process.
The aims of the PPP are to: Aim 1. Foster innovative environmental health research that fills critical
translational gaps and fosters CEHJNM’s current and future research directions. Aim 2. Support early-career
faculty members, particularly those identifying with groups historically underrepresented in science and
academia, to develop creative, novel research projects. Aim 3. Attract faculty members from the CU
community with diverse backgrounds and expertise. Aim 4. Facilitate research on crucial environmental health
questions and concerns identified through multidirectional communications with community groups and
stakeholders."
10850672,"Project Summary
In the eight years since its inception, the Mount Sinai P30 Center on Health and Environment Across the
LifeSpan (HEALS) has greatly accelerated environmental health science (EHS) research. Using a life course
approach and the underlying philosophy that environment plays an important role in all diseases, we have
formed new transdisciplinary teams partnering with other Mount Sinai P30 Centers in Aging, Cancer, and Skin
Biology, as well as our Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA), to bring environment into more
research programs at Mount Sinai. We have prioritized diversity among Center Members, recruits, and trainees
and linked scientists with cross-disciplinary backgrounds to address complex research questions. We
expanded our NIEHS funding base—catapulting from 27th to 2nd in funding dollars—and more than tripled our
overall funding. This growth, largely fueled by our Pilot Projects program, accelerated career development for
our Center Scientists and other Members. The Center supports three Facility Cores: an Integrated Health
Sciences Facility Core that supports biomarker research and access to clinical populations/biospecimens, a
Biostatistics and Data Science Facility Core that supports analysis of environmental data and creates new data
analytical methods needed for exposomic research; and a clinically-oriented Phenotyping and Environmental
Modifier Facility Core that supports state-of-the-art measures of health and environmental modifiers (stress,
nutrition, etc.). Our Community Engagement Core is committed to multi-directional communication and
partners with diverse communities. These partnerships, along with strong links with physicians, enable us to
effectively translate Center research findings into evidence-based approaches for disease prevention and
treatment. In the next funding cycle, the Center will continue to build capacity, new research programs, and
expand further into each of the Core areas. With outstanding institutional support through our Institute for
Exposomics Research and ties to our CTSA, we will bring EHS into all Mount Sinai research programs. In line
with this goal, we anticipate a need for additional human resources and physical infrastructure to increase
Facility Core capacity and to remain at the cutting edge of exposure science and EHS—the Center is essential
to meet these needs. Finally, our program aligns with NIEHS strategic goals: our Research Groups
(Exposomics-Mixtures, Environmental Justice, and Clinical Environmental Research) emphasize the study of
multiple exposures working via multiple mechanisms and move EHS toward health equity research and
precision medicine initiatives. The Center also emphasizes shared biological pathways of exposures, individual
susceptibility, exposomics, environmental causes of disease, and community engagement, all of which are
central to NIEHS's mission. In closing, its remarkable success to date positions the HEALS Center for
expanded reach and impact through continuing to meet the changing infrastructure needs of our environmental
research community to accelerate EHS discovery and translation."
10850673,"Project Summary
The Mount Sinai Center on Health and Environment Across the LifeSpan (HEALS) Administrative Core
provides scientific direction, fiscal management, organizational initiatives, and career development programs.
Our goal is to bring EHS to more and more research programs locally and nationally because environment is
critical to all diseases. Since our Center's founding in 2014, we have built a strong NIEHS funding base with 28
active NIEHS grants- going from the 27th ranked institution in NIEHS funding 10 years ago to #2 today. We
also have 47 other grants from other NIH Institutes and extramural programs working in environmental health
science (EHS). The Center's Career Development Program supports a Center Scientist with funding and
access to career enhancement programs. This program has been particularly successful as four of six past
Center Scientists have received their first R01 and a fifth recently received a 9th-percentile score on her
application. To advance EHS under our life course theme, the Administrative Core supports three Research
Groups—exposomics/ mixtures, environmental justice, and clinical environmental research—that bridge silos
and bring EHS to all of Mount Sinai through seminars, workshops, and journal clubs to discuss cross-cutting
EHS issues. The Administrative Core also oversees 4 Cores: an Integrated Health Sciences Facility Core that
supports biomarker research and population health research, a Biostatistics and Data Science Facility Core
that supports environmental health/toxicology data analysis and generates analytic methods for exposomic
data, and a clinically-oriented Phenotyping and Environmental Modifier Facility Core that supports state-of-the-
art health measures. Our Community Engagement Core implements multi-directional communication and
partnership locally, and its Stakeholder Advisory Board supports the Administrative Core by providing counsel
on policy and environmental issues of local importance. Notably, our community emphasis promoted increased
community-based participatory research (CBPR) Pilot Project funding, with 12 CBPR pilots funded in the last 4
years. Overall, our Pilot Projects Program has been remarkably successful, with 48 of 78 funded pilot grants
awarded to ESIs and a greater than 40:1 return on investment. The Administrative Core receives scientific
guidance from an External Advisory Board of EHS experts and administrative and institutional guidance from
an Internal Advisory Board, composed of senior Mount Sinai Faculty who are directors of other NIH-funded
P30 Centers. Our Center leverages the Mount Sinai Institute for Exposomics Research (see Dean's letter) to
bring additional support to accelerate the Center's scientific breakthroughs in EHS. Our continued expansion is
ensured by the robust infrastructure and leadership within the Administrative Core to leverage institutional
resources and propel the Center forward. In this renewal cycle, we will focus on bringing EHS to additional
research programs through partnerships with our CTSA, other Mount Sinai based P30 Centers and with a new
partnership with City University of New York, the largest Hispanic serving institution in New York."
10894608,"PROJECT SUMMARY: While 1.4% of people have the congenital defect of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV),
BAV patients make up 50% of the patients that receive aortic valve replacements. Moreover, patients
with BAVs develop aortic stenosis (AS) earlier, and thus require replacements at younger ages than
patients with normal tricuspid aortic valves (TAV). Given the limited durability of replacements, BAV
patients have a high procedure burden that negatively affects their length and quality of life. Therefore,
development of a pharmacological therapy will reduce morbidity and mortality from AS.
Our long-term goal is to understand the BAV disease process at the cellular level to develop effective
treatments that mitigate AS. Since no pharmacological treatment has been forthcoming, our hypothesis
is that abnormal valve interstitial cell (VIC) deformation patterns present in BAVs have a crucial role in
the biochemical signaling events in AS. Since AS is associated with VIC activation into myofibroblasts
and transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB) signaling, this study addresses the relationship between
mechanically-conditioned cellular morphology and TGFB signaling in two specific aims:
1. Determine what parameters of mechanical conditioning experienced in varying aortic valve
 anatomies affect VIC morphology. The level of myofibroblast activation will first be determined in
 native human valve leaflet explants from BAV and TAV. The morphologies of cells from native
 tissues will be compared to that of cells mechanically conditioned in a novel 3D high-throughput
 biaxial oscillatory stretch screen (3D HT-BOSS) to determine what cyclical biaxial stretch, matrix
 stiffness, and VIC basal contractility is required to produce morphologies seen in BAVs and TAVs.
2. Ascertain how altering mechanical pattern will modify VIC response to TGFB. Quantitative
 proteomics will be employed to develop steady-state models of VIC TGFB signaling from VICs
 freshly isolated from native human valve leaflets. Microscopy of 3D HT-BOSS samples will then be
 employed to analyze shifts in: 1) EC50 of αSMA protein and 2) nuclear localization of TGFB-
 mediated transcription factors upon exogenous TGFB stimulation.
Through this investigation, underlying drivers of AS and novel target pathways for pharmacological
treatment will therefore be uncovered.
Furthermore, the training that the fellowship applicant, Dr. Toni West, will receive will enable her to
make the leap to becoming an independent investigator. Dr. West will be conducting research in the
lab of her sponsor, Dr. Michal Sacks, and in the lab of her collaborator, Dr. Aaron Baker, at the
University of Texas. As part of her training, Dr. West will travel to Columbia University, where her co-
sponsor Dr. Giovanni Ferrari runs the biobank she will be collecting tissues and cells from."
10791787,"Project Abstract. Medicaid expansion is a critical antipoverty tool that protects individuals from health care
costs and reduces food and housing insecurity, significant contributors to poor health and health disparities.
Medicaid expansion increases access to primary care, a hypothesized mechanism by which this public
insurance coverage for low-income individuals reduces social needs. However, social needs and access to
primary care are influenced by the sociocultural and built environments as well as health care system supply.
This study applies the NIMHD’s Research Framework to understand how these domains of influence
differentially shape access to primary care across those with or without social needs and in turn explores a
possible mechanism in which Medicaid expansion reduces food and housing insecurity, primary care use.
This work will leverage a well-established state-university partnership and unique data set consisting of the
experiences of newly enrolled Medicaid expansion members in Virginia. The following existing data will be
linked for this study by Medicaid member identification number: 1) pre-enrollment surveys asking members
about their experiences in the year prior to Medicaid expansion enrollment (n=1,255), 2) a follow-up survey
asking members about experiences in the year after enrollment (n=580), 3) all encounter and pharmacy claims
data for these same Virginia Medicaid members, and 4) publicly-available measures of sociocultural, built
environment, and health care system domains of influence linked to members’ census tracts or counties. The
proposed research is supported by Virginia Medicaid as it aligns with the agency’s commitment to advance
health equity through increasing primary care and reducing social needs. This proposed work aims to: 1)
Assess how sociocultural environment, built environment, and health care system domains modify the effect of
food and housing insecurity in the year prior to Medicaid expansion enrollment on primary care utilization in the
year after enrollment, and 2) Explore whether primary care utilization reduces food and housing insecurity after
the first year of enrollment in Medicaid expansion. Ultimately this work will provide much needed evidence to
policymakers about the disparities in access to primary care across sociocultural and built environment factors
as well as provide insight into how Medicaid expansion is reducing social needs. Addressing social needs
through health care policies and primary care system design will improve population health and is necessary to
achieve health equity. This application describes an excellent research and training environment for the
proposed work, supported by a collaborative mentorship team that includes both faculty members and Virginia
Medicaid’s Chief Medical Officer. This proposal will provide integrated, robust clinical and research training in
health disparities, health policy, and geospatial statistics to a physician-scientist dedicated to practicing family
medicine and pursuing a faculty position focused on advancing health equity through health policy."
10808883,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a fast-growing disease with no FDA-approved treatments. Numerous
studies have linked NAFLD-associated hepatocyte lipotoxicity with mitochondrial dysfunction during the last few
decades. Though the onset of inflammation that drives the progression from NAFL to NASH is considered
multifactorial, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) released by
injured hepatocytes are essential in activating Kupffer cells and promoting peripheral immune cell infiltration.
Sphingolipids are biochemical signaling mediators and can regulate mitochondrial function in metabolic
diseases, including NAFLD. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a well-studied molecule with dualistic roles in cell
function, dependent on the location of the sphingosine kinase (SphK) isoforms, SphK1 and SphK2. While SphK1-
generated cytosolic S1P signaling is thoroughly described in the literature, few studies assess the role of SphK2-
derived S1P. SphK2 is localized to the cell nucleus and mitochondria. In the context of NAFLD, nuclear SphK2
is anti-inflammatory by inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and preventing the transcription of
proinflammatory genes. In contrast, the role of SphK2 within the mitochondria is not well defined. Previous in
vitro studies evaluated the effect of cytosolic S1P, rather than mitochondrial S1P, on mitochondrial function.
While SphK2 function has been assessed in hepatocytes, these studies have only defined short-term effects of
SphK2 on hepatic steatosis. Our long-term goal is to understand sphingolipid regulation and define the
mechanisms that influence NAFLD disease progression. The central hypothesis of this application is that
dysregulation of mitochondrial SphK2 promotes NAFLD disease progression. Two specific aims are
proposed to test the hypothesis. Aim 1 examines the role of SphK2 in regulating mitochondrial function in
hepatocytes under metabolic stress. We will determine if exposure to palmitic acid alters mitochondrial
sphingolipid metabolism in hepatocytes and further assess the impact of SphK2 depletion on mitochondrial
complex IV function and assembly in hepatocytes. Aim 2 determines the impact of hepatic SphK2 on modulating
the immune response under metabolic stress. First, we will measure the ability of SphK2 depleted hepatocytes
to induce cytokine synthesis in Kupffer cells. Second, we will use spectral flow cytometry to determine SphK2-
dependent variations on the hepatic immune cell profile in the WDSW model. Lastly, we will use an adenoviral
vector system to determine whether overexpressed hepatocyte SphK2 exhibits protective effects in NAFLD
pathogenesis. To date, these functions of hepatocyte SphK2 have not been defined in the literature. Completing
our proposed study will contribute to our understanding of SphK2 in hepatocyte mitochondrial function and
highlight how SphK2 influences inflammation in NAFLD. Our novel findings are essential to fundamental
hepatocyte biology and may influence future studies targeting sphingolipid signaling in developing innovative
pharmacotherapies for NAFLD."
10850789,"Abstract
Diarrheal disease is a major health issue worldwide resulting in nearly 500,000 deaths annually
in children under 5 years of age. Those who survive have higher risk of stunted growth and
cognitive development. Identification of the gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens that cause diarrheal
disease helps guide effective treatment. Currently, in the developed world, this is done using
multiplexed PCR laboratory tests which are expensive, slow and require a sophisticated high
complexity laboratory. Unfortunately, such laboratory tests are not available in remote and
resource limited regions in the developing world where mortality due to diarrhea is the highest.
Thus, we propose to develop an integrated, low-cost, point-of-care (POC) test to identify the GI
pathogens that cause diarrheal diseases. This test will be useful in resource-limited settings of
the developing world as well as in primary care and urgent care settings of the developed world
where it will be useful to detect the GI pathogens in real time, in the clinician's office so the
patient can be treated with the right drugs, right away, without loss of patients to follow up. The
major problem with detecting gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens is the complexity of stool samples,
often filled with particulate and molecules such as bile salts. Such contaminants can inhibit
signal amplification and detection if not properly removed from the sample. In previous SBIR
projects, GoDx has developed sample preparation chemistry, DNA amplification and detection
assays on lateral flow paper strips for a suite of GI pathogens. Our next step is to develop a
pathogen detection device that fully integrates sample processing and signal amplification,
which can be used rapidly at the point of care (POC). To achieve this, we propose to develop a
stool sample prep device that can robustly provide viable DNA for amplification and detection all
while requiring minimal user action to do so. The technology proposed here will be able to
extract and enrich DNA from a swab of stool in a matter of minutes without the need for
centrifuges or pumps. In Phase 2 of this project, we will fully integrate the GoDx’s amplification
and detection assays with the sample prep technology developed here, providing a seamless,
minimal step POC device for the detection of GI pathogens that cause diarrheal diseases
around the world."
10892037,"PROJECT SUMMARY
GAPs (GTPase activating proteins) play an essential role in the GTPase cycle, allowing for the regulation of
complex processes such as signal transduction; consequently, their dysfunction has significant ramifications. In
the case of p120RasGAP (RasGAP, p120; RASA1), the first GAP described, dysfunctions have been linked to
vascular diseases such as capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndromes (CM-AVM) and vein of
Galen malformations (VOGM). The protein consists of an N-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2)-SH3-SH2 cassette,
followed by pleckstrin homology (PH), C2, and GAP domains. Despite its importance and relatively long history
as a target of study, p120RasGAP has not been adequately analyzed at the structural and biochemical levels.
In particular, although full-length p120RasGAP has been shown to have greater activity than the GAP domain
alone, the contributions of the PH and C2 domains have not specifically been isolated. I hypothesize that the
GAP activity of p120RasGAP is controlled through conformational changes induced by the protein’s
regulatory domains, which are in turn affected by lipid head groups and/or other binding proteins. Specifically,
my preliminary data demonstrate that the C2 domain may play a role in GAP regulation. I will test these
mechanisms in two aims. In Aim 1, I can already express and purify constructs of the GAP, C2, and PH domains
of p120RasGAP, and preliminary enzymatic analysis suggests that the C2 domain accelerates enzymatic
activity. I will conduct detailed enzymatic studies in vitro using GAP assays to assess the roles of these domains.
I will then assess the effect of disease-causing mutations on enzyme activity. Additionally, I will quantify the
affinities of the PH and C2 domains for different lipid head groups and assess C2 calcium sensitivity. These
data will then be used to conduct in vitro GAP assays using vesicle-bound Ras to test the role of membrane
association in PH and C2 regulatory behavior. In Aim 2, I have already obtained and am refining the first crystal
structure of the C2-GAP region of p120RasGAP. This crystal structure demonstrates that the C2 and GAP
domains are connected by a flexible linker and illustrates that the C2 domain is ideally positioned to interact with
the allosteric lobes of Ras in an “opposable thumb” formation. I will also obtain a crystal structure of the C2-
GAP region in complex with HRas to observe this binding directly. Based on analysis of these structures, I will
validate interactions made by the C2 domain via site-directed point mutagenesis and GAP assays. Taken
together, these aims will provide a comprehensive analysis of the roles of the PH and C2 domains in regulation
of p120RasGAP and reveal interactions responsible for the observed changes in activity. These studies will
elucidate molecular bases for vascular diseases including CM-AVM and VOGM."
10995259,"Project Summary
 Enantioenriched amines are prevalent functional groups found in various bioactive compounds and
pharmaceuticals. Current methods for accessing them come with limitations, such as poor atom-economy, poor
selectivity, poor reactivity, or requirement for high-pressure gases. Transition metal catalyzed cross-coupling
reactions represent a powerful approach towards accessing enantioenriched amine compounds, which could
overcome some of the inherent issues with current state-of-the-art. However, the discovery of new asymmetric
transition metal catalyzed processes often requires exhaustive ligand screening and search for an optimal set of
conditions that enable satisfactory activity, chemoselectivity, and stereoselectivity. In some processes, the best
metal catalysts employed are those without any added ligands or with ligands to which no chiral equivalents
exist, presenting challenging scenarios for enantioinduction. This proposal outlines an alternative approach
towards the development of new transition metal catalyzed methodology, utilizing hydrogen-bond donor (HBD)
catalysis to activate C(sp3)–O bonds towards a Ni-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction. This dual catalytic platform
is a conceptually unexplored approach towards cross-coupling chemistry, wherein the role of the HBD is to
accelerate the oxidative addition while simultaneously imparting stereoselectivity to the step through ion pairing.
These roles have traditionally been assigned to ligand properties as the driver of reaction development, however
this proposed research will demonstrate the feasibility of leveraging both catalytic modes to cooperatively engage
mild electrophiles in an enantioconvergent C(sp3)–C(sp2) cross-coupling to generate amine compounds. Suzuki-
Miyaura and Mizoroki-Heck type couplings of readily-accessible hemiaminal substrates will be explored by
leveraging HBD-mediated substrate ionization for the generation of iminium ions. HBDs have been demonstrated
to be effective catalysts for the generation of iminium ions, and their subsequent engagement in enantioselective
trapping by standard nucleophiles. Unlike these traditional reaction profiles, the trapping of iminium ions by a
metal is proposed here. Interestingly, various stereoselective Ni-catalyzed couplings of C(sp3)–O bonds have
been reported to perform the best under “ligandless” conditions or with olefinic ligands that are not easily
converted to chiral equivalents, thus highlighting the strategy of this approach. Successful execution of this
proposal will reveal a new method for accessing enantioenriched amines and establish a proof-of-concept for
the synergistic cooperation of HBD-catalysis with transition metal catalysis."

The proposed BTRR is a collaboration between staff of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS)
and the staff of the existing Structural Molecular Biology (SMB) Resource at the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL). The proposed BTRR will be managed as a single
resource under the existing LCLS organization. It will be comprised of three TR&D projects that
will be centrally driven by an evolving portfolio of Driving Biomedical Projects (DBPs). Guidance
from an External Advisory Committee (EAC) as well as from a local Executive Committee will be
an integral part of the strategic planning of the Resource. The proposed BTRR spans the use of
two existing X-ray facilities at SLAC and beamtime award will follow established processes for
each lightsource, with each having separate Proposal Review Panels comprised of external
experts that make recommendations to the respective management of each lightsource.
The proposed BTRR will strengthen an already strong collaborative effort between SSRL-SMB
and LCLS staff. The synergies between the two SLAC lightsources have been exploited for years
with collaborative developments on sample delivery systems for rapid scanning, as well as
common pursuits of liquid jet delivery capabilities and operations. For the proposed BTRR, SMB
staff will take leading roles in some of the TR&D efforts and be involved in all aspects of the BTRR
from strategic planning to technical decisions. SMB is in itself a funded Resource. The proposed
BTRR will create a separate Resource that will leverage the experience and expertise of existing
and future SMB staff. SMB staff will be part of the proposed Resource in a matrixed fashion,
functionally reporting to the BTRR management while administratively continuing to report to
SMB. Central to the coordination of these efforts will be the direct involvement of SMB in strategic
planning for the proposed BTRR. This will ensure staff working on the proposed BTRR are fully
integrated within the proposed BTRR efforts.
The Administration and Management component of this proposal will include the creation of an
External Advisory Committee as well as a Local Executive Committee which will help provide
guidance to the BTRR management team. Administrative and financial management support will
be provided for the BTRR via this component."
10867284,"ABSTRACT: TR&D-1
To enable beamtime at the oversubscribed LCLS source to be used for scientific discovery, not
experiment optimization, the activities under this TR&D are aimed at developing the tools
necessary to fully prepare for biomedical experiments and to characterize samples both before
and during LCLS beam time. This ranges from understanding the sample quality and properties,
as well as the state of the sample during complex sample delivery, or during a dynamic process
being studied. The existing capabilities of SLAC will be enhanced via this TR&D, providing new
tools in sample preparation and characterization, as well as new diagnostics to understand the
state of the sample. Furthermore, capabilities at SSRL will be leveraged and augmented to use
the synchrotron X-ray beam as a key tool to prepare for LCLS beamtime and for new science.
Finally, spectroscopic capabilities for sample characterization at LCLS will be expanded.
The proposed TR&D scope is at the cutting-edge of the biomedical structural biology field by
exploiting X-ray FEL capabilities to solve new structures and study the dynamics of molecules
under near-physiological conditions at ambient temperatures. The proposed developments will
make use of state-of-the-art X-ray FEL capabilities and complement them with offline capabilities
that themselves represent cutting-edge advances. The TR&D will increase the combined
technologies’ impact on biomedical research by providing higher readiness levels to LCLS
experiments for higher quality data in a shorter time. By increasing efficiency, the “extra” beam
time access will be used for additional higher-risk, higher-reward experiments. It will also allow
more rapid access to solve emerging scientific questions. By taking X-ray FEL sample preparation
and delivery from an art to a quantitative science, it is expected that LCLS and this BTRR will
have a significant impact in the structure determination of complexes and membrane proteins,
provide accurate active site structures of metalloenzymes, and provide enhanced and more
broadly available capabilities to observe macromolecular dynamics using the combined powers
of LCLS and SSRL."
10867288,"ABSTRACT: TR&D-2
TR&D-2 tackles the challenges of sample delivery for data collection at the LCLS X-ray FEL. High
intensity X-ray FEL beams used to probe sample structure will destroy the sample after exposure
to a single X-ray pulse. As a result, experiments at LCLS require a sample delivery system that
can replace the damaged sample between every X-ray pulse. Crystal injectors were the first
crystal delivery method used for serial femtosecond diffraction and are commonly used at X-ray
FEL facilities because they can efficiently deliver a large number of crystals, reduce background
scattering and enable new classes of time resolved studies. Sample injectors produce a thin
stream of crystals (or sample solution) by ejecting a suspension through a small orifice. X-ray
pulses at a high repetition rate interrogate the crystal stream and a diffraction pattern is produced
each time a crystal and an X-ray pulse coincide. While it is possible to collect serial data at
cryogenic temperatures with rapid scanning fixed target systems, injectors can replenish room
temperature samples at even faster rates. Furthermore, many biomedical problems require the
unique features offered by sample injectors including methods that use rapid mixing to study
biomolecular dynamics.
TR&D-2 focuses on advancing injector-based sample delivery methods to enable research
following the DBP themes, specifically, solving new structures of membrane proteins and other
radiation sensitive biomolecules and enabling the study of protein dynamics including those of
metalloenzymes. This will be achieved via the development of remote access capabilities for data
collection for Lipidic Cubic Phase (LCP) and other viscous media samples, as well as through the
thorough testing and optimization of rapid mixing injectors. TR&D-2 aims to maximize the
efficiency in the use of the unique LCLS beam, promoting greater access to biomedical
community and new scientific discovery."

TR&D-3 will focus on automating the LCLS structural biology experiment, using injector-based
sample delivery, streamlining the process of solving new structures, and examining dynamic
processes of biomolecules using mixing injectors and photo-excitation to trigger reactions.
Significant effort is required to fully automate the LCLS experiment that requires the addition of
new controls and feedback sensors combined with adept implementation of advanced algorithms
to monitor the experiment and make corrections or flag for intervention when appropriate. The
extremely effective MC beam lines at SR sources show what decades of innovation in these areas
can accomplish. The SSRL SMB program is experienced in experimental automation and were
the first SR beamlines in the world to offer a remote-access program to SR users, establishing a
new paradigm for SR access and structural genomic. TR&D-3 intends to duplicate the successes
at SR sources in automation, and achieve similar accomplishments at LCLS, including automated
sample delivery, data collection, data analysis and feedback for experiments at room temperature.
Shorter times to collect datasets with real time feedback of data quality and completeness (and
in the case of time resolved experiments, difference data metrics) will allow more structures to be
determined, which in turn will allow users measuring a dynamic process, such as an enzymatic
reaction, to get a more complete structural time series. More effective and, consequently, shorter
data collection times will also allow more samples, users and access to the unique capabilities of
LCLS leading to a broader scientific impact in biomedical applications.
With the study of dynamics under near physiological conditions being at the core of LCLS
applications, this TR&D will provide enhanced visible light excitation capabilities and injector
alignment to support time resolved studies, including the use of mixing injectors and laser
illumination to trigger reactions. The use of laser-released caged compounds will drive dynamics
studies of GPCRs and RNA polymerase-II. Laser-induced temperature jump capabilities will drive
the goal of understanding protein dynamics by exciting them out of equilibrium and tracking the
time-evolution of the system. Overall, TR&D-3 will aim to achieve the scientific goals of all the
DBPs through improved reliability and automation of the entire experimental process."
10867294,"ABSTRACT: DRIVING BIOMEDICAL PROJECTS PORTFOLIO
Nine Driving Biomedical Projects (DBP) are selected in this component of the proposed BTRR.
These DBPs were selected based on high scientific merit as well as their need for X-ray methods
to obtain structural and dynamic information that will reveal the detailed function of various
biomolecules of interest. As such, they fulfil the primary purpose of providing scientific context
and motivation for the technologies to be developed by the proposed BTRR. The DBPs will also
provide necessary test beds for the developed technologies and create a virtuous cycle of iterative
technology development that will lead to new broadly available capabilities for the biomedical
community.
The DBPs are organized along three themes. 1-Structure determination of large macromolecules
and membrane proteins. 2-The determination of accurate active site structures of
metalloenzymes, such as ribonucleotide reductase and cytochrome c oxidase, and complex
macromolecular machines, such as RNA polymerase-II. 3-A common research area of all DBPs
involve time-resolved (TR) studies that include research to follow dynamic processes involved in
adenine riboswitch signaling, the transport mechanism of N. gonorrhoeae MtrF, antibiotic binding
to β-lactamase and examination of interaction specificity of CypA variants.
These DBPs will drive method developments in efficient structure determination using the Linac
Coherent Light Source (LCLS). They will also drive the development of robust rapid mixing
capabilities that will reveal antibiotic binding dynamics or enzymatic reactions with high spatial
and temporal resolution, as well as new methods in light activated caged compound release and
understanding conformational space dynamics in biomolecules using light to push them out of
equilibrium.
Overall, the proposed DBPs cover a breadth of scientific problems of high interest to the
biomedical community and NIH and they represent a strong set of requirements that will push the
BTRR technologies towards tools that will serve the biomedical community for the long term."

10756508,"Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), a member of the human γ-herpesvirus family is also termed
as human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8). KSHV is an etiological agent of an endothelial tumor called Kaposi’s
sarcoma (KS) and a highly aggressive lymphoproliferative B cell lymphoma called primary effusion lymphoma
(PEL). KS is the most common vascular malignancy causing high morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected patients.
PEL is a rare tumor of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues and is associated with a poor prognosis. PEL cases
have been dramatically reduced in the US since the widespread use of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART)
but KSHV still causes significant mortality in the developing world. There is a critical need in KSHV targeting
specific antiviral drugs, which are very well tolerated with no severe adverse events for immunocompromised
patients with KSHV associated malignancies. KSHV exhibits two distinct phases in its life cycle. During latency,
a minimal number of latency genes such as vFLIP (ORF71), vCyclin (ORF72), latency-associated nuclear
antigen-1 (LANA-1; ORF73), and Kaposin are expressed. By contrast, during the lytic phase, KSHV expresses
a wide array of immediate-early (IE), delayed-early (DE), and late genes; undergo active replication and produce
virion progeny. KSHV has been shown to utilize multiple host growth factors, cytokines, angiogenic factors, and
cell signaling and metabolism-related proteins for creating a beneficial environment for its replication, survival,
and latency. Our exciting studies discovered that: 1) KS skin lesions express remarkably robust expression of
nucleolin compared to healthy skin tissue; 2) KSHV de novo infection in primary endothelial cells induced a high
level of nucleolin and phospho-nucleolin, and more importantly, 3) Incubation of KSHV infected cells with G-
quadruplex forming anti-nucleolin aptamer AS1411 reduced KSHV latent (ORF73) and increased lytic (ORF50)
gene expression and we obtained similar results in nucleolin silenced KSHV infected PEL cells. 4) AS1411
treatment was efficacious in inducing cell death in KSHV infected PEL cell lines. Based on our preliminary results,
we hypothesize that KSHV induces host factor nucleolin to support its latency and life cycle and targeting
nucleolin with AS1411 would have therapeutic potential in KSHV associated malignancies. To test this
hypothesis, we have formulated two specific aims in which we will 1) To determine the regulatory mechanisms
of nucleolin expression upon KSHV infection and its role in KSHV latency, and 2) To evaluate the
chemotherapeutic potential of using AS1411 to treat KS and PEL. Our studies are significant and will have
a positive impact by advancing the unexplored and novel targeted theranostic field of aptamers in KSHV biology
and understanding their antiviral and anticancer potential can also be applied to other viral malignancies."

Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD) is a genetic and selective predisposition to clinical
disease caused by weakly virulent mycobacteria, such as Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccines and
environmental mycobacteria (EM). Patients with MSMD are occasionally vulnerable to other intra-macrophagic
pathogens (e.g. salmonella). The pathogenesis of MSMD remained unclear until 1996, when its first genetic
etiology was deciphered in children with interferon-γ receptor 1 (IFN-γR1) deficiency. Genetic studies over the
last 25 years have identified 16 MSMD-causing genes, including 14 autosomal (IFNG, IFNGR1, IFNGR2,
STAT1, IL12B, IL12RB1, IL12RB2, IL23R, IRF8, SPPL2A, RORC, ISG15, TYK2, JAK1) and 2 X-linked genes
(NEMO, CYBB). The high level of allelic heterogeneity at these loci has defined 31 distinct disorders. There is
however physiological homogeneity, as all disorders impair IFN-γ immunity. Mutations in 5 genes (RORC,
ISG15, TYK2, JAK1, STAT1) can underlie an atypical, syndromic form of MSMD, with an associated phenotype.
With hindsight, MSMD is a misnomer, as most genetic etiologies show incomplete penetrance for MSMD. This
serendipitously led to the discovery of genetic etiologies of bona fide tuberculosis. Remarkably, only about half
of the 900 international patients studied in our lab carry MSMD-causing lesions in the exons and flanking intron
regions at any of these 16 loci. In this renewal application, we hypothesize that unexplained MSMD cases can
result from novel monogenic inborn errors of immunity, possibly but not necessarily involving IFN-γ mediated
immunity. We aim to identify new MSMD-causing genes by following a genome-wide (GW) approach, based
primarily but not exclusively on whole-exome sequencing (WES). We will enroll at least 50 MSMD patients each
year. We will search for novel genetic etiologies by testing a hypothesis of genetic homogeneity, i.e. searching
for genes mutated in two or more families. We will also test a hypothesis of genetic heterogeneity, i.e. searching
for genes mutated in a single family. This search will benefit from our 12-year-long development of computational
tools to analyze WES. Causal relationships between candidate genotypes and MSMD will be established
experimentally in great mechanistic depth at the molecular, cellular, and immunological levels, taking advantage
of cutting-edge technologies and our 25-year-long study of MSMD. In patients without candidate genotypes by
WES, we will search for candidate regulatory variations in known and unknown MSMD-causing genes by whole
genome sequencing (WGS). Our preliminary results are exciting, as we have identified MSMD-causing mutations
in genes known to be crucial for IFN-γ immunity (TBX21, IRF1) and in other genes that probably disrupt IFN-γ
immunity by novel mechanisms (ZNFX1, MCTS1). From an immunological standpoint, this research will provide
novel insights into the mechanisms of human immunity to mycobacteria. From a medical standpoint, this work
will provide molecular diagnoses for MSMD patients and genetic counseling for families, while offering the use
of therapeutic IFN-γ, at least in patients whose genetic disorder does not abolish cellular responses to IFN-γ."
10831960,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
People with HIV (PWH) need consistent access to care and antiretroviral therapy (ART) to achieve the sustained
viral suppression (VS) critical for individual health (reduced morbidity, comorbidities, and mortality) and public
health (preventing transmission of HIV). The United States (US) has significant geographic disparities in HIV VS
for PWH with low incomes who rely on state AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAPs), ranging 53% to 99%.
ADAPs support 26% of PWH in the US with a $2.4 billion annual budget. As a key part of the US HIV healthcare
delivery safety net, ADAPs provide free ART by direct provision or through ADAP-subsidized insurance plans.
ADAP implementation varies widely because individual state ADAPs have decision-making flexibilities for health-
care delivery programs and policies. Additionally, how ADAPs perform for different subgroups remains unknown.
Understanding how ADAPs can optimize VS could reduce healthcare costs, because each HIV infection averted
saves $402,000. To support ending the US HIV epidemic, our long-term goal is to use epidemiologic, including
causal inference framework, and qualitative methods, to identify how to improve VS for all PWH, including those
with low incomes, through healthcare delivery programs. With a focus on disparities and health equity, our over-
arching research question is what specific healthcare delivery programs and policies for PWH with low incomes
increase sustained VS rates and reduce VS disparities related to race/ethnicity? Our team has studied ADAPs
since 2014. Our study results have been used to advocate to successfully change healthcare laws. The Principal
Investigator, the only researcher with federal funding to study this aspect of HIV healthcare delivery, and the
interdisciplinary team will use expertise in novel causal epidemiology and qualitative methods. We have partner-
ships with the National Alliance of State & Territorial AIDS Directors (NASTAD) and six state health departments
providing access to multistate individual-level data (comprising 20% of ADAP clients; including ADAPs at VS
rate extremes), and for a national study, we will interview AIDS/ADAP leadership. We will complete the following:
Aim 1: we will decompose disparities in sustained VS related to race/ethnicity. We will quantify the mediating
effect of a modifiable factor, ADAP healthcare delivery programs. Aim 2: we will quantify potential improvements
in sustained VS for individual state ADAPs informed by state ADAP client mix. Using simulation for all state
ADAPs, we will estimate the impact on sustained VS of ADAP clients changing to specific ADAP programs. Aim
3: we will perform interviews of AIDS/ADAP Directors across the nation. Using qualitative analyses, we will iden-
tify the ADAP programs and policies that improve VS and improve health equity. Successful completion of this
work will provide evidence to inform state/federal regulation and resource prioritization toward the goal of helping
people achieve VS and interrupting HIV transmission. Our findings would allow state ADAPs, advocates, policy-
makers, and Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative leaders to adopt best practices identified from our study and to
develop new interventions (laws, guidance, funding) to optimize VS- translating data into policy and action."
10814904,"Carbohydrates, glycans, and their conjugates play critical roles in a very broad
spectrum of biological processes, many of which are central to human health,
development and disease states. The diversity of glycan-dependent biological
processes is reflected by the even-more diverse spectrum and complexity of the
implicated glycans and glycoconjugates, collectively known as the glycome. The study
of glycan dependent biological processes and their eventual regulation and/or
exploitation in human medicine is enormously hampered by difficulties in isolating and
structurally characterizing meaningful quantities of pure unique glycans, known as
homogeneous glycoforms, from biological sources. It is imperative therefore that simple
practical technologies for glycan synthesis be developed that combine robustness with
ease of operation such that specialist and non-specialists alike will be able to access
glycans with relative ease. This proposal aims to develop exactly the kind of scalable
robust methodology that is required to address the chemical synthesis of a broad cross
section of the glycome. The focus is on the development of direct photochemical
methods without the need for external additives thereby reducing the system to its
essentials – a glycosyl donor and glycosyl acceptor – and eliminating complexity to the
greatest extent possible. The technologies to be developed are designed to employ
light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as light sources and ultimately to be applicable under flow
conditions so as to enable practical scaled-up syntheses of biologically important
glycans."

which is
indicated that on average 77%-95% of patients benefit from hypnotic pain management relative to control

education or pain management training. As a result, this clinically efficacious intervention is rarely used by
providers to help patients in need. Objective: The goal of the proposed R25E is to train cancer care providers
in hypnosis to manage cancer pain. The Specific Aims are to: 1) Refine and implement a Hypnosis for Cancer
Pain (HCaP) training program; 2) Evaluate the effectiveness of the HCaP training on providers' knowledge,
skills, attitudes, and self-efficacy for using hypnosis to manage cancer pain; and, 3) Evaluate the impact of the
HCaP training program on trainees' real-world practice, using a mixed-methods approach. The HCaP training
content is guided by sociocognitive theory. Training will focus on the following domains: 1) Understanding
Cancer Pain; 2) Understanding Hypnosis; 3) Using Hypnosis for Cancer Pain Management; 4) Using Hypnosis
for Managing Symptoms, Thoughts, and Behaviors Associated with Pain; and, 5) Hypnosis Metacompetencies
(e.g., therapeutic alliance, empathy, cultural sensitivity). The evaluation plan for HCaP is guided by Miller's
pyramid of clinical competencies, and will focus on three levels of evaluation: Knowledge and Practical
Understanding, Skills, and Clinical Practice. Methods: Cancer care providers (N=400; including medical, allied,
and psychosocial providers) from across the country will be recruited via professional organizations, listservs,
and conferences. Trainees will participate in a blended training program including multimedia E-Learning and a
2-day live workshop, with evaluations linked to each modality. Trainees will also be evaluated at 3 months
following the workshop. Long-term goals: The proposed R25E is a critical first step toward improving quality of
care and quality of life for cancer patients in pain. Connection to NCI mission: This project is consistent with the
Healthy People 2020 goal of improving quality of life of cancer patients and survivors."
10817892,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Obesity is growing at epidemic rates worldwide and leads to a broad spectrum of other disorders,
which collectively form metabolic syndrome. Central to these pathologies is the adipose tissue. In mammals,
there are two functionally distinct types of fat: white adipose tissue, which stores excess calories, and brown
and its related beige adipose tissue, which dissipates energy for thermogenesis. Numerous studies in rodents
have demonstrated that increasing the amount or activity of brown or beige fat holds excellent therapeutic
potential for obesity-related metabolic diseases. Adipose tissue undergoes dramatic remodeling in response
to environmental challenges. Cold exposure is an effective way to increase brown fat mass and activity. as
well as to induce browning of white adipose tissue. While it has long been postulated that growth factors
produced by the adipose niche play a critical role in the remodeling of brown and white fat upon cold
challenge, the identity of such factors have remained mostly unidentified. Recently, we discovered that
fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 9 is a cold-induced adipokine and can induce UCP1 expression independent of
brown adipogenesis. In addition to adipose progenitors, FGF9 also stimulates thermogenic program in mature
adipocytes. Importantly, expression of FGF receptor 3 (FGFR3), the receptor that mediates FGF9’s effects, is
also induced by cold in both the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells and adipocytes, suggesting that FGF9
functions as an autocrine/endocrine factor within the adipose niche. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of the
adipose SVF, we identify FGFR3’s abundant expression in the vascular endothelial cells. Based on these
exciting findings, we hypothesize that FGF9, produced by adipocytes, functions as a niche factor to promote
brown and white adipose tissue remodeling and modulate thermogenic program in mature adipocytes, in
response to cold challenge. The primary goals of this grant are to 1) determine the role of FGF9 in regulation
of thermogenic program in mature adipocytes and delineate the underlying transcriptional and epigenetic
mechani, 2) determine the role of FGF9-induced angiogenesis in adipose remodeling, and 3) use both gain-
and loss-of-function mouse models and nanotechnology to define the in vivo role of the FGF9-FGFR3 axis in
energy metabolism and explore the potential of targeting this pathway to develop new therapies to treat
obesity and its many related co-morbidities. Completion of the proposed studies will lead to a new
understanding of adipose remodeling and could provide potential therapeutic approaches for obesity, type 2
diabetes, and other related metabolic diseases."
10807972,"Obesity-induced insulin resistance is the major determinant of metabolic syndrome, which precedes the development of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and is thus the driving force behind the emerging diabetes epidemic. Current anti-diabetic therapeutics are available, but are inadequate to control the disease in most patients and there is a large unmet medical need for better methods of treating diabetes to prevent morbidity and mortality. Our recent work has led to the discovery that obesity induces a dynamic change in secretion of hepatic extracellular vesicle (EV) miRNAs that exert profound impacts on insulin producing cells and peripheral insulin sensitivity. Depletion of hepatic extracellular miRNAs in the hepatocyte-specific Rab27KO mice resulted in impaired glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity at the early onset of obesity. We further demonstrated that 4wks high-fat diet feeding (4wks-HFD)-induced hepatic EV miRNAs can reduce the insulin resistance of obese recipient mice. In addition, the 4wks-HFD EV treatment significantly enhanced the insulin
secretion and proliferation of beta cells in vitro and in vivo. By contrast, prolonged obesity induced secretion of pathogenic hepatocyte EV miRNAs that blunted insulin sensitivity of lean recipient WT mice. Consistently, the mice without hepatic extracellular miRNAs by knockout of hepatic Rab27 showed a reduction in insulin resistance after 16 weeks HFD feeding. miRNA-free EVs derived from YBX1KO hepatocytes had minimal effects on the metabolic phenotypes of recipient mice, suggesting miRNAs as key cargoes within these EVs. Using a novel thiouracil tagging method, we identified that miR-3075-5p, a highly enriched miRNAs in 4wks-HFD EVs, can be efficiently incorporated into target cells and improves cellular insulin responses through repressing Fa2h expression. In addition, the miR-434-3p-Map2k6 regulatory axis plays a critical role in
promoting proinflammatory activation of macrophages, which can subsequently exacerbate tissue
inflammation and insulin resistance. These results lead to the conclusion that hepatic EV miRNAs are important endocrine molecules regulating functions of insulin-producing and -targeting cells in obesity. This proposal sees to build on this newly identified hepatic EV miRNAs regulatory system to reveal the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of obesity-induced insulin resistance. We will further determine the mechanisms by which hepatic EV miRNAs modulate functions of beta cell and insulin sensitizing cells in response to obesity. With the proposed experiments, we will develop miR-3075-5p as an insulin sensitizer molecule and explore the pathogenic effect of miR-434-3p in obesity. This therapeutic strategy could be used for the treatment of obese patients with insulin resistance pre-diabetic state. This would lead to improved glycemic control adding a new component in our therapeutic armamentarium for the treatment of this widespread metabolic disease. Finally, using the thiouracil tagging method, we will identify the hepatic extracellular miRNAs in circulation as biomarkers predicting the insulin resistance state in obesity."

First responder, military, and law enforcement personnel regularly carry backpack loads of up to 60% body
weight. Use of the hands and fingers is often needed during or immediately after load carriage, but loads
applied via backpack straps can constrict blood flow and compress the brachial plexus nerves of the upper
limb. These factors can potentially lead to pain, injury and impaired use of the upper limbs. Understanding the
acute effects of heavy load carriage on upper limb physiology will aid development of field-based functional
measures to reduce the risk of injury and prevent long-term loss of hand function. Persons who regularly carry
heavy backpack loads for occupational purposes report incidences of pack palsy, a disability causing lack of
sensation and weakness in the hands. The proposed work aims to investigate relationships among
physiological changes, manual functional deficits during pack carriage, and pack palsy. It is unclear how the
magnitude and duration of backpack carriage affects acute changes in grip strength, pinch strength, manual
dexterity and light touch sensory threshold. The overall hypothesis is that walking with backpack load will
cause changes in upper limb blood flow, edema, and nerve conduction. Further, we expect these physiological
changes will result in measurable differences in manual dexterity, strength, and light touch sensory threshold
that will change with increasing load in the backpack and duration of time walking with load. To address the
hypotheses, I will determine the relative acute changes in upper limb blood flow, edema and nerve conduction
before and after walking with heavy backpack load. I will also identify quantitative changes in blood flow, grip
strength, pinch strength and manual dexterity at load levels of 15% and 30% body weight as compared to a
control condition. I will explore the effects of walking time with backpack load on upper limb blood flow and light
touch sensory threshold of the fingers which may be affected by nerve compression from backpack straps.
This much needed research will improve understanding of upper limb physiological and neuromuscular
changes with backpack carriage. The innovative methodology will allow study of multiple upper limb
physiological changes simultaneously. Increased understanding of backpack carriage could improve
prevention of brachial plexus injury and therefore reduce incidences of weakness or loss of hand function.
Application of this work could lead to early diagnosis of brachial plexus compression by means of functional
measures. Results of this work may improve hand function, injury prevention, and treatment of the upper
extremity for those who carry heavy backpacks in an occupational or recreational setting."

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a major contributor to excessive disability, morbidity, and mortality in the United
States. Currently, almost 10 million Americans misuse opioid substances and 2.7 million Americans suffer from
OUD. In the past year alone, U.S. opioid overdose deaths have increased by nearly 30%, resulting in an annual
mortality rate of >100,000, akin to a death every 5 minutes. Given the scope of the U.S. opioid epidemic, there
is an essential need for proactive, routine, evidence-based OUD screening by an individual’s prescribing primary
care provider or mental health clinicians. However, screening for opioid misuse is underperformed, laborious,
and is susceptible to demand characteristics and concerns about stigmatizing the patient. To combat these
issues, BEAM Diagnostics, Inc. developed Beacon-OUD, a commercializable digital screening tool for OUD. The
tool is based on the theoretical behavioral framework of reinforcer pathology, a widely adopted behavioral
economic approach to addictive behavior. Beacon-OUD is: (1) quick and easy-to-deliver to patients, with
automated, standardized scoring to reduce time barriers; (2) accessible, easy-to-comprehend and self-
administer; (3) non-stigmatizing and assesses risk without disclosing sensitive information; (4) oriented to current
and future, not past, OUD behavior; and 5) interoperable and integrated with a patient’s medical record to
improve the standards for OUD assessment and patient-centered care. In Phase I of this project, we conducted
a clinical study, validating Beacon-OUD as demonstrating robust predictive accuracy of opioid misuse and
receiving positive reports of feasibility and acceptability from providers. The goal of this Phase II SBIR is to
extend Beacon-OUD’s development into a fully realized commercial product, both as a stand-alone tool and as
an integrated tool within an electronic medical record (EMR) system at a large multi-site healthcare system
serving approximately 1M outpatients per year. Aim 1 will optimize the user-experience and accessibility of
Beacon-OUD as a product, produce comprehensive clinical reference materials, and complete a Spanish-
language translation. Aim 2 will integrate Beacon-OUD into EPIC, a widely used electronic medical record
system within a health system partner to improve usability, workflow capabilities, and record-keeping of opioid
misuse directly in a patient’s medical chart. In addition, Aim 2 will launch education and implementation initiatives
to promote Beacon-OUD’s use primary care. Finally, BEAM will complete an Exploratory Aim seeking to validate
and expand Beacon-OUD’s clinical utility as a measurement-based care tool for OUD treatment prognosis. At
the conclusion of this Phase II project, BEAM will have brought Beacon-OUD to market as a digital assessment
for OUD measurement, both as a stand-alone product and an EMR-integrated version."

 The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop new tools to study how T cells defend against pathogens
and eradicate cancerous cells within our bodies. ~106-108 unique T cell clones circulate in the adult human body
seeking evidence of foreign peptide fragments on the surface of other cells. Once the T cell encounters a target
cell with foreign or mutant peptides, it initiates activation mechanisms that unleash a potent immune response.
The very first step in T cell activation involves recognition between the T cell receptor (TCR) and the short
peptides (8-11 amino acids) presented by the major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) protein. Because T cells
are highly migratory and antigen recognition occurs when the T cell physically contacts a target cell, it is no
surprise that the TCR-pMHC complex experiences molecular forces that influence antigen potency. Indeed, our
lab and others have shown that TCR activation relies on pN force transmission to its cognate pMHC. Current
screening technologies to identify antigenic peptides measure affinity without regard to mechanical force and
are thus poor predictors of antigen potency. To address this problem, we will develop mechano-ID to specifically
tag T cells based on the magnitude of mechanical forces transmitted through the TCR-pMHC complex. Mechano-
ID integrates advances in proximity tagging with molecular tension probes pioneered by the PI. The fundamental
principle behind this proposal is the concept that a well-defined TCR force unfolds a DNA hairpin, exposing a
cryptic binding site that recruits enzymes. These enzymes, in turn, will generate reactive species, such phenoxy
radicals that covalently tag proteins within a ~20 nm radius. Thus, mechano-ID detects energized biomechanical
forces and nearby interactome rather than static protein-protein interactions. Preliminary data shows the
feasibility of mechano-ID applied to primary T cells. In Aim 1, we will optimize mechano-ID to enhance its yield
and specificity for force-induced tagging of TCR-pMHC mechanical events. Parameters such as reagent
concentrations, timing, and the mechanical stability of the nucleic acid probes will be investigated. The assay
will be integrated into a spherical bead platform to boost yield. In Aim 2, we will demonstrate mechano-ID for
screening of T cell-antigen specific interactions. The altered peptide library of the SIINFEKL pMHC antigen will
be tested to establish a direct correlation between antigen potency and mechano-ID signal. Chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR) T cells will tested to further demonstrate mechano-ID in the area of cancer immunotherapy. The
outcome of this proposal is an innovative method that allows one to tag cells based on mechanical phenotypes
–thus opening the door to linking genotype to the mechanotype and enabling the field “mechanomics”. Finally,
we note that mechano-ID transcends T cell biology and will be broadly useful in the study of virtually any
mechanotransduction process."
10767314,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The overarching goal of the research presented in this application is to understand what make some
genomic loci more susceptible than others to environmental chemical perturbation. Using inorganic arsenic
(iAs) as a model environmental toxicant of high human relevance, we will seek to mechanistically investigate
how epigenetic crosstalks dictate locus-specific sensitivity to arsenic.
 iAs is a model epigenetic toxicant owing to its well described impact on global DNA hypomethylation
coinciding with a reduction in the levels of the universal methyl donor SAM, used towards DNA and histone
methylation. However, this model of epigenetic mechanism of iAs has been acknowledged as largely
unsatisfactory since (1) even in the context of global DNA hypomethylation, some loci show hypermethylation
while others show no change, and (2) the effect on histone methylation are non-uniform with many methylated
histone marks showing increases while others show a decrease. Here, we propose to build on compelling
preliminary data obtained through highly quantitative Mass Spec and metabolomic studies that show that in
mouse ESCs, at levels where sodium arsenite does not cause a significant increase in ROS levels, a
pronounced decrease in SAM, DNA methylation, and in several histone marks, such as H3K36me2/3, are
observed. However, H3K27me3 levels are increased while H3K9me3 levels are unchanged. Furthermore,
RNA-seq studies revealed even in the context of profound transcriptional changes, repetitive elements that are
repressed by deposition of H3K9me3 remain transcriptionally silenced following sodium arsenite exposure.
Thus, we hypothesize that epigenetic crosstalks can differentially compete for the reduced SAM pool
caused by iAs exposure, thereby driving locus sensitivity.
 To test this hypothesis, we will use mouse ESCs where crosstalks are well characterized. In aim 1, we will
characterize the genome-wide changes in DNA methylation and in 3 distinct histone PTMs. We will also test
whether these epigenetic alterations caused by iAs require the metabolic activity of the arsenic
methyltransferase AS3MT. In aim 2, we will use a combination of knock-down, over-expression, and profiling
approaches to mechanistically interrogate in the context of arsenic exposure the role of the well-characterized
crosstalks between DNA methylation and histone PTMs at distinct genomic loci. Finally, in aim 3, we will
examine the reprogrammability of arsenic-induced epigenetic alterations as ESCs are differentiated into early
stage germ cells and go through profound waves of epigenetic remodeling.
 At the completion of these aims, we will have established the comprehensive profile of changes in DNA
methylation and 4 histone PTMs following arsenic exposure. We will also have determined how epigenetic
crosstalks mediate locus-specific sensitivity to arsenic and their ability to be reprogrammed in PGCs. This work
will firmly establish the central role of epigenetic crosstalks in the response to environmental insults."

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory disease. Its impact is greatest in the young, the
elderly and the immunocompromised. As yet, there are no vaccines to prevent infection, or effective antivirals to
treat those who become infected. A greater understanding of the viral factors that facilitate replication and impact
pathogenesis could aid development of effective interventions.
RSV is a member of the non-segmented negative strand RNA viruses. Its polymerase complex transcribes the
viral genome to produce subgenomic, capped and polyadenylated mRNAs. A key factor in the RSV transcription
machinery is the viral M2-1 protein, an elongation factor, which is required for the polymerase to complete
transcription of longer genes and in doing so to access downstream regions of the genome. While this
transcription elongation function of M2-1 and its structural and biochemical properties are well established, recent
findings have hinted at an additional, unexplored role for M2-1 in post transcriptional regulation.
RSV transcribes its genome in cytoplasmic inclusions. High resolution microscopy studies revealed that M2-1
accumulates together with newly synthesized RSV mRNAs and cellular translation proteins, eIF4G and
cytoplasmic poly A binding protein, within inclusion body associated granules that are spatially separated from
the RSV genome RNAs and polymerase. This finding suggests that following transcription of an RSV mRNA,
M2-1 might remain associated with it to facilitate transfer to the translation machinery. Further, recent work
revealed that in addition to binding to RSV mRNAs, M2-1 binds to specific regions within a subset of cellular
mRNAs, including mRNAs involved in immune responses to viral infection. Intriguingly, a key feature of M2-1 is
a Zn-finger domain containing an unusual cysteine-cysteine-cysteine-histidine (CCCH) motif, that is typically
found in cellular proteins involved in post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA involved in immune responses.
These findings, combined with published data that shows that RSV M2-1 interacts with cellular proteins involved
in mRNA metabolism, leads us to the hypothesis that M2-1 exerts a post-transcriptional role in RSV and/or
cellular gene expression. The goal of this project is to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will determine if M2-1 affects
RSV protein expression independently of its effects on RSV transcription elongation. Aim 2 will characterize the
effects of RSV M2-1 on protein expression from CXCL5 and CANX, two of its cellular mRNA targets.
Together, these experiments will yield new insight into the role of the RSV M2-1 protein with implications for
understanding a key aspect of the RSV replication cycle and mechanisms underlying RSV pathogenesis. In
addition, given that the distinctive Zn-finger CCCH motif is shared in proteins of other related viruses, this project
could have an impact beyond RSV biology, providing novel insight into the filoviruses and other pneumoviruses."
10844455,"In the vertebrate peripheral nervous system (PNS), specialized glial cells called Schwann cells form the myelin
sheath, which is required for fast action potential propagation as well as neuronal health and survival. The
importance of myelin in normal nervous system function is perhaps best underscored by myelin loss and
inefficient remyelination of axon tracts observed in diseases such as demyelinating peripheral neuropathies.
Such disruptions of myelin can lead to permanent neuron loss, significant pain and morbidity, and ultimately
paralysis. Currently, no treatments exist to prevent demyelination or to enhance remyelination, in part because
of our incomplete understanding of the genetic and molecular control of myelination.
To identify new regulators of myelinating glial cell development, we previously performed a large-scale forward
genetic screen in zebrafish. Through this screen, we identified new mutants in dedicator of cytokinesis (dock1)
and previously showed that these global mutants exhibit severe defects in radial sorting and reduced
myelination in the PNS during development. Moreover, our preliminary analyses suggest a critical function for
Dock1 in nerve repair following injury in adult zebrafish. Dock1 encodes a highly conserved atypical guanine
nucleotide exchange factor that can activate the small Rho GTPase Rac1. To date, no role for Dock1 function
in Schwann cells has been described, although Rac1 is a known regulator of Schwann cell development. Here,
we propose to use zebrafish and mouse models to dissect the mechanisms by which Dock1 controls PNS
development and repair. We aim to define the function of Dock1 in Schwann cells (Aim 1), uncover pathways
up- and downstream of Dock1 function (Aim 2), and test if Dock1 is required for myelin maintenance or repair
following nerve injury in the mammalian PNS (Aim 3). Together, these experiments will define fundamental
mechanisms underlying axon-Schwann cell interactions in development, injury, and repair and can lay the
foundation for new therapies to treat human neuropathies and peripheral nerve damage."

The molecular mechanism of pathogenesis of preeclampsia (PE) is largely unknown, and effective prevention
and treatment strategies remain elusive. PE is a pregnancy-associated hypertensive condition and complicates
approximately one in 20 pregnancies in the US and is a leading cause of pregnancy-related maternal mortality
and neonatal morbidity/mortality worldwide. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a vasoconstrictive peptide of 21 residues,
and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in EDN1, coding for a precursor for ET-1, are associated with PE.
Edn1H/+ mice in which Edn1 expression is elevated to 3X normal have normal blood pressure, despite elevated
circulating ET-1. However, Edn1H/+ dams develop full spectrum of PE-like phenotypes in their late pregnancy.
In addition, the embryos from Edn1H/+ dams, regardless of their Edn1 genotypes, lag in development during
early implantation stage with disoriented ectoplacental cones. We reported that nicotinamide (amide form of
vitamin B3, Nam), inhibitor of ET-1 downstream of ADP ribosylcyclase, ameliorates the PE-like phenotypes in
two separate mouse models of PE, and our preliminary data show that Nam decreases urinary albumin
excretion and increases the number of survival fetuses when Edn1H/+ dams were treated during the entire
pregnancy. These observations have led us to hypothesize that PE in Edn1H/+ dams originates from abnormal
placentation caused by a high maternal ET-1 expression at early implantation stage, and that Nam can correct
this damage and protect dams from later PE development. Accordingly, Specific Aim 1 will test this
hypothesis by dissociating early effects from later effects of Nam on PE of Edn1H/+dams by treatments with this
vitamin starting at different gestational stages and for different durations. Pregnancy outcomes including blood
pressure, urinary albumin and fetal number and weight will be determined at 18.5 day post coitus (dpc). In
addition, the expression of components of ET-1 system and Nam’s effects on them at implantation stage will
be examined. Specific Aim 2 will investigate the mechanism of effects of ET-1 and Nam on differentiation
from human trophoblast stem cells into designated trophoblast cells by using 2- and 3- dimension culture
system. Pharmacological dose of ET-1 alone, or ET-1 plus Nam will be added to the specific conditioned
medium. Cells will be examined by their morphology, motility, and expression of markers of different types of
trophoblasts. Specific Aim 3 will investigate the mechanism of effects of ET-1 and Nam on impaired uterine
decidualization and angiogenesis. The markers of endometrial stomal differentiation, the structure of blood
vessels and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in uteri at the implantation stage of
pregnancy will be examined. Primary cultured endometrial stromal cells will be treated with pharmacological
dose of ET-1 alone, or ET-1 plus Nam, and the markers of differentiation and the expression of VEGF will be
determined. The proposed research will broaden and deepen our understanding regarding the role of the
maternal genetic factor ET-1 on PE and identify a potential intervention strategy for PE."
10823260,"An estimated 1.5 million people die each year from invasive fungal infections (IFIs), with millions more afflicted
by debilitating mucosal and subcutaneous mycoses. Current antifungal therapies have serious deficiencies
including limited spectrum of activity, patient toxicity and the emergence of fungal isolates with genetically
encoded resistance. A larger concern is the modest efficacy of all three major classes of antifungal drug, as
this is likely a major driver of the excessively high rates of mortality in patients with IFIs, and persistence of
mucosal infections. For unexplained reasons, the majority of treatment failures occur in patients infected by
fungal isolates that are seemingly sensitive to the selected antifungal therapy, as determined by in vitro
susceptibility testing. For example, approximately one-third of patients with a disseminated Candida infection
involving isolates deemed susceptible according to current clinical breakpoints, fail to respond to treatment with
an azole antifungal. Several host-related factors have been proposed to explain the discordance between in
vitro susceptibility tests and patient outcomes, such as inadequate drug distribution to the site of infection or
severity of patient immune dysfunction. However, there is only limited evidence to support these arguments,
and many treatment failures remain unexplained. While drug-drug interactions are a serious concern from the
perspective of patient toxicity, the effect of most co-administered medications upon fungal physiology and
antifungal susceptibility, is largely unknown. Using a simple screen of mainly off-patent medications, we
recently found that a staggering 139 of the 1280 compounds examined exhibit antagonistic interactions with
fluconazole in at least one medically important Candida species. Our preliminary studies have also revealed
that non-antifungal medications can have a profound impact upon fungal physiology and upon the outcome of
infection in mice. The objective of this study is to uncover the full scope of antifungal drug-drug antagonistic
interactions and assess their potential clinical impact upon treatment outcomes in patients with IFIs. In aim 1
we will conduct a comprehensive and systematic set of screens to identify currently approved medications that
antagonize the activity of the most relevant antifungal drugs, in four of the most prevalent human fungal
pathogens. Those acting at pharmacologically relevant concentrations will then be selected, and the extent to
which antifungal activity is diminished compared. Aim 2 will focus upon defining the molecular mechanisms by
which antifungal antagonists act and examine their effects upon fungal physiology. Finally, in aim 3 we will use
a mouse model of invasive candidiasis and conduct a retrospective analysis of patient outcomes to determine
if coadministration of antagonistic drugs is sufficient to influence the clinical efficacy of antifungal therapy. The
long-term goal is to improve patient outcomes through establishing integrated treatment protocols that
minimize clinically relevant antagonistic drug-interactions to and therefore maximize antifungal efficacy."

Musculoskeletal health is a key determinant of mobility and quality of life which affects every individual,
regardless of age. Up to 20% of the 6 million fractures occurring annually in the US will result in nonunion or
slow healing and require intervention for bone regeneration. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are one
alternative to bone grafts because of their osteogenic, chondrogenic, and proangiogenic potential. Compared
to monodisperse cells, MSC spheroids better resist apoptosis and secrete 100-fold higher levels of angiogenic
factors while retaining their multipotency. However, MSC spheroids are not yet sufficient to bridge large bone
defects, suggesting the need for effective programming methods to enhance their bone-forming potential.
Furthermore, it is unclear whether bone healing is more effective by jumpstarting cartilage formation or
attempting to induce osteogenic differentiation of resident or transplanted cells. Local delivery of inductive
growth factors such as BMP-2 and TGF-b1 accelerates tissue formation, but the necessary supraphysiological
concentrations and associated complications impair their widespread clinical use. Our data demonstrate that
MSC spheroids loaded with cell-secreted extracellular matrix (ECM) are more responsive to potent mitogens
and exhibit enhanced osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation while using markedly reduced dosages and
reducing contraindications. Thus, our central hypothesis is that MSC spheroids can be differentiated in situ
toward the osteogenic or chondrogenic lineage by presenting inductive cues adsorbed to incorporated ECM,
which will yield potent cellular building blocks to regenerate large lost bone volumes. Aim 1. Adapt cell-
secreted ECM to locally present inductive factors to MSCs within spheroids to enhance osteogenic or
chondrogenic differentiation. We will test the role of ECM quantity and BMP-2 and TGF-b1 dosage on growth
factor retention and presentation of loaded morphogens and correlating their resulting effect on osteogenesis
and chondrogenesis in vitro. Aim 2. Potentiate MSC osteogenic or chondrogenic differentiation by
manipulating ECM-driven morphogen presentation. We will identify and quantify changes in integrin expression
and growth factor receptor activity in MSC spheroids containing ECM-adsorbed BMP-2 or TGF-b1. We will
then assess changes in MSC differentiation when decoupling the synergy of cell adhesion and growth factor
availability. Aim 3. Establish the therapeutic potential of ECM-adsorbed exogenous morphogens to instruct
MSC spheroids in situ for bone formation. We will determine the capacity of MSC spheroids containing ECM-
adsorbed BMP-2 or TGF-b1 to persist, undergo osteogenic or chondrogenic differentiation in situ, and repair
large bone defects. We will use noninvasive imaging and histology to describe the superior pathway to
promote robust bone formation in long bone defects. The proposed research is innovative because it provides
a novel strategy to reduce the quantity of recombinant growth factors needed to guide cell function, while
establishing whether MSCs directed toward cartilage or bone achieve faster bone repair in long bones."
11039527,"Project Summary/Abstract
Genetic disorders and genetic diseases are caused by insertions, deletions, and base substitutions of a single
gene or multiple genes. Cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive hereditary disease, is caused by mutations
of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. In healthy cells, CFTR maintains
chloride and bicarbonate transportation as an ion channel. Genetic defects of CFTR result in complicated
respiratory and systemic organ failure. Point mutations, or single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), account for ~60%
of the pathogenic variants causing CF. CF patients can be partially treated by the administration of small
molecule drugs to improve symptoms, including chronic pulmonary disease and pancreatic insufficiency.
However, CF mutations leading to the premature termination codon (PTC) affect at least 10% of CF patients,
whose symptoms cannot be relieved by any of the modulators. Gene therapy is a promising and permanent
alternative approach that confers therapeutic benefits to patients who suffer from genetic diseases. The CRISPR-
Cas9 system can efficiently cause double-strand breaks (DSBs) to facilitate homology-directed repair (HDR) for
accurate gene-editing outcomes. However, safety concerns arising from the DSBs cause unwanted mutations.
To surmount this problem, base editors (BEs) use a nickase Cas9 (nCas9) that nicks only the protospacer
adjacent motif (PAM)-containing strand, and thus eliminates the risk of DSBs and random indels. BEs use a
natural or engineered DNA deaminase fused with a nCas9 and can introduce a C-to-T or an A-to-G conversion
within the activity window by the cytosine or adenine deaminase. Both cytosine BEs (CBEs) and adenine BEs
(ABEs) can enable base transitions with high efficiency and have already proven successful for a few genetic
diseases in proof-of-concept studies. However, before applying BEs to the treatment of human genetic diseases,
including CF, several challenges must be overcome. First, indiscriminate conversion of multiple ‘C’s or ‘A’s within
CBE or ABE’s characteristic deamination activity window, usually more than five nucleotides, results in undesired
bystander editing. Second, the targeting scope of BEs has been largely constrained by the NGG PAM
requirement of nSpCas9, the canonical Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes. A large proportion of the base
transition pathogenic mutations is thus unavailable for editing. Third, the lack of multiplexity of BEs impedes its
practicality in processing multiple mutations simultaneously for the treatment of complex genetic diseases. In
this proposed research, we aim to develop precise and multiplex BEs that will make it possible to target the vast
majority of human genome sites (Aim 1 & 2). We will apply high-precision BEs to generate and correct
homozygous and compound heterozygous CF disease models that mirror individual patients, which will also
greatly facilitate pharmacological research and drug discovery for personalized CF treatment (Aim 3). In
summary, high-precision BEs will contribute to personalized gene therapy for cystic fibrosis as well as many
other genetic diseases."
10848215,"Project Summary/Abstract
Unprecedented rates of obesity are occurring in childhood and disproportionally affect Black youth,
Hispanic/Latinx youth, and youth from economically marginalized backgrounds beginning as early as infancy.
Obesity in infancy is not outgrown, tracks into adulthood, and places infants and children with obesity at a
higher risk for significant medical comorbidities (e.g. cardiometabolic complications) in adulthood. The
healthcare cost of obesity is ~$260 billion annually across the lifespan. Recent evidence suggests that infancy
may be a critical period for the development of this high weight trajectory, as 10% of infants meet criteria for
high weight-for-length; with the incidence being even higher among infants of color (16.3%), infants of
Hispanic/Latinx ethnicity (12.1%), and economically marginalized infants (12.2%). Several modifiable
predictors of obesity risk have been identified in infancy, including rapid weight gain in the first year, parental
use of food to regulate infant distress, early introduction to solid foods, and insufficient infant total cumulative
sleep. These risk factors are higher among Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and economically marginalized infants.
Thus, obesity prevention starting in infancy has been advocated. The proposed research project addresses a
novel opportunity for prevention in pediatric primary care, by pilot testing a promising, innovative infant obesity
prevention intervention that utilizes a responsive parenting paradigm (e.g. promotes healthy infant regulation)
to target the development of healthy feeding and sleep behaviors in infancy. The intervention will be delivered
within pediatric primary care via an emerging model of integrated behavioral health. A responsive parenting
approach to obesity prevention is strengths-based and focuses on accurate caregiver interpretation of infant
cues, feeding behaviors, soothing, and sleep, rather than potentially stigmatizing messaging related to obesity,
and thus, is more salient to caregivers of infants than an obesity-focused intervention. We will conduct a pilot
RCT comparing our responsive parenting intervention to treatment as usual in 138 infants who are from
communities of color (e.g., non-White; Hispanic/Latinx) or economically marginalized backgrounds (i.e.,
publicly insured). Families will receive four prevention sessions with the integrated behavioral health specialist
at their routine primary care well-child visits during the first six months of life. The primary outcome is
conditional weight gain (an indicator of rapid weight gain) at 9 months of age. The responsive parenting
approach, delivered by an integrated behavioral health expert, has been culturally adapted for infants and
caregivers who are economically marginalized and/or from communities of color through focus groups. The
delivery of this intervention via integrated behavioral health in a pediatric primary care setting has the potential
to have a significant public health impact in terms of preventing pediatric obesity later in life; and thus,
improving health outcomes and reducing health disparities."
10772149,"Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has transformed our ability to track the spread of pathogens in healthcare
settings. With the ability to identify patients linked by transmission has come the capacity to determine with
high confidence the role of certain hospital locations, contaminated infrastructure, and colonized healthcare
personnel in mediating the spread of infections in hospitals. Moreover, broad integration of genomic with
clinical data has the potential to identify not just pathways of transmission, but also patient characteristics and
hospital practices that influence organism-specific transmission rates. However, to realize the potential of WGS
as a tool for precision infection prevention will require overcoming critical barriers. The most significant
challenges stem from the role that epidemic lineages play in the overall antibiotic resistance epidemic. It has
been shown that the majority of antibiotic resistance in healthcare settings is due to the importation and spread
epidemic lineages that have reached high-prevalence in regional healthcare networks. Due to the high
prevalence of a small number of strains, it becomes challenging even with WGS to determine whether two
infected patients are linked by transmission within the hospital, or if one or both patients acquired their
infections during a previous community or healthcare exposure. The standard approach for discerning if two
patients are linked by transmission is to employ species-specific thresholds for the number of single nucleotide
variants (SNVs) separating two patients isolates; above which they are concluded to not be linked by
transmission and below which transmission is deemed likely. However, there is a great deal of evidence that
applying these SNV-thresholds can lead to both false-positive and false-negative transmission inferences.
Sources of error include the difficulty of discriminating between recent transmission at a connected healthcare
facility and higher than expected SNV differences between true transmission pairs due to mutation
accumulation during long-term colonization. Here, we seek to develop, validate, and apply sampling,
sequencing and analysis strategies to enable accurate transmission inference in high-prevalence endemic
settings. In Aim 1 we will build on preliminary data showing that we can group patients linked by transmission
in an SNV-threshold free manner, and evaluate several methods for detection of intra-facility transmission
clusters. In Aim 2 we will develop and apply population sequencing strategies to comprehensively detect and
track the spread of multiple strains between patients. In Aim 3, we will expand the analysis of population
sequencing data to incorporate sharing of unfixed alleles into transmission inference. Lastly, we will apply our
optimized genomic epidemiology toolkit to determine the relative contribution of importation, patient-to-patient
transmission, environmental contamination and intra-patient evolution to colonization burden with five high-
priority MDROs in an ICU over the course of a year. In total, we expect the results of this proposal to enable
the routine use of genomics to track and prevent the spread of infections in hospitals."

The mission of the Mount Sinai Center on Health and Environment Across the LifeSpan (HEALS) is to
promote team-based environmental health science (EHS) research that embraces a life course approach to
EHS. Within the Center, the Integrated Health Sciences Facility Core (IHSFC), serves as a key linchpin in
the Center's activities, providing researchers with expert consultation on exposure science, toxicology, life
course human development, biomarkers of exposure and biological response, lab feasibility assessment and
access to clinical and epidemiologic population resources. The IHSFC promotes research translation with the
Community Engagement Core(CEC) and connects Center Members with additional Mount Sinai Core
resources, such as those found in our Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA). This work is facilitated in
part through our very close CTSA relationship, as Dr Rosalind Wright, Center Deputy Director and Phenotyping
and Effect Modifier Facility Core (PEMFC) leader is also the CTSA director. Dr Maida Galvez, our CEC Leader,
also leads Community Engagement in the CTSA giving us substantial access to, and expertise in, clinical and
translational research resources. Working with Center Members we adapt our expertise and resources to fit
measures that are ideal for different life stages with a focus on particular critical periods (pregnancy, infancy,
early childhood, adolescence, midlife, elderly) during which individuals are commonly more susceptible to
environmental exposures. Exposure assessment offerings include targeted and untargeted exposure assays,
tooth based biomarkers that reconstruct early life environment, and satellite based remote sensing “big data”
models that assess air pollution and weather among other variables. The IHSFC also fosters studies that
emphasize environmental justice, as well as environmental clinical research (i.e. the role of environmental
factors on patient response to treatment and/or disease progression). We help Center investigators establish
teams of cross-disciplinary collaborators who together will extend the boundaries of environmental health
sciences. The IHSFC has developed innovative methods to comprehensively measure past exposure to
environment insults and facilitated access to clinical populations and biospecimen archives that have led to
new R01 grants in EHS. The IHSFC does not replicate services provided by other Mount Sinai core labs, such
as those supported by our CTSA. Rather, the IHSFC leverages and supplements CTSA resources to facilitate
Center Member access to additional relevant core labs (e.g. CTSA sequencing core) as well as the Mount
Sinai institutional biobank (BioME). The IHSFC is a resource that allows researchers to build highly efficient
and collaborative teams that conduct research that positively impacts health across the lifespan. In sum, the
IHSFC serves as a gateway to a variety of expertise and resources under a single administrative umbrella,
providing an intellectual milieu that promotes collaboration and brings EHS to research programs across the

The mission of Mount Sinai's P30 Center on Health and Environment Across the LifeSpan (HEALS) is to
accelerate team science–based research utilizing life course–informed models of health. The Biostatistics and
Data Science Facility Core (BDSFC) plays a key role in that mission by modeling complex exposure and
phenotype data generated by Center Members across a spectrum of study types (basic, clinical,
epidemiologic), exposures and health outcomes. Services include study design, covariate selection, data
analysis as well as developing methods when needed to address our Center's research themes (mixtures/
exposomics, clinical environmental research, and environmental justice). Environmental conditions are not
distributed equally and the risk of higher toxic exposures is not random. Higher rates of poor air quality, poor
water quality, poor nutrition and the probability of exposure to toxic chemicals tracks along racial and
socioeconomic gradients. By embracing a life course approach, our Center promotes research that addresses
both the early life and later life environments that determine developmental health trajectories. We also
emphasize the complexity of environmental health which crosses space (geospatial variability) and time
(longitudinal effects, life stage effects) while bridging public health (prevention of disease) with medicine
(diagnosis and treatment variability). Our approach is based upon the fundamental principle that “all diseases
have an environmental basis.” While we offer standard data analytic services (e.g., linear models, longitudinal
mixed effects models, power calculations, study analysis planning) the statistical methods and study designs
needed for analyzing the complex, high-dimensional data that arise in much of our Center's work are still
relatively new and require knowledge of advanced statistical techniques and the ability to curate and interpret
complex biologic data – expertise maintained by the faculty of the BDSFC. Core faculty and researchers
engage in research motivated by questions and methodological challenges that arise from center
collaborations and innovations by our Center Cores. Core faculty and staff provide statistical and data science
training for postdoctoral fellows working on environmental health sciences (EHS) related projects. Providing
such services via a core facility allows the P30 Center to build and maintain specialized resources (e.g.,
expertise in measuring and advanced statistical, data science and epidemiological methods related to
evaluation of environmental mixtures). Thus, to support the overall goals of the P30 Center, the BDSFC
proposes the following specific aims: (1) to ensure that Center projects are grounded in sound
biostatistical/data science principles and use state-of-the-art methods for design and analysis of EHS data; (2)
to conduct mission-critical biostatistical/data science methods research for further quality assurance of all
research and data analysis methods; and (3) to assist in the training of biostatistical/data science principles
and analysis methods to Center investigators, fellows and post-doctoral trainees."

the P30 Center on Health and Environment Across the LifeSpan. Since Center inception in 2014, the PEMFC
has evolved to guide selection of age-appropriate, valid, time-effective, and low-burden approaches to
measure health and disease across the lifespan with a focus on particular critical periods (pregnancy, infancy,
early childhood, adolescence, midlife, older-adult). This includes Center-supported space and phenotyping
equipment covering a growing list of identified target priority areas (obesity, respiratory, allergy, sleep,
cardiovascular, endocrine, neurodevelopment/psychological phenotypes). The Core also facilitates research to
elucidate the impacts of key interactions between chemical toxicants and environmental modifiers,
specifically social determinants (e.g., psychological stress, social networks, gender) and nutrition. A related
focus is to uncover mechanisms underlying health inequities observed in our local communities and more
globally, linking to our Community Engagement Core. In this funding cycle, we will promote growth in
large-scale population-based environmental health research, phenomics, and decentralized
phenotyping. Our P30 Center sits within a health system comprising eight hospitals and over 400 practices
that uses a unified Epic electronic health record. We are thus positioned to leverage an integrated clinical data
warehouse linked with unique biobanks, providing an unprecedented foundation for integrating our healthcare
delivery and data science efforts to generate novel environmental research. Coupling this with our Center's
expertise in studying environmental exposures (ambient pollution, temperature, crime, built environment),
capturing spatio-temporal variability and incorporating timescales from days to years, we can accelerate large-
scale place-based transdisciplinary health research. We also harness institutional infrastructure in digital health
(apps, wearables) and data science (machine learning) to facilitate decentralized phenotyping. The scope of
responsibility for the PEMFC includes: 1) developing, maintaining, and providing access to pediatric and adult
health assessments that include self-reports, observational data, and performance-based measures; 2)
tailoring protocols to specific research needs; 3) advising psychometric analyses including the use of multiple
phenotypes in a phenomic or true multivariate analysis; and 4) providing access to unique covariates from
high-resolution and well-validated geospatial datasets. The PEMFC curates measures together with a
summary of the psychometrics as well as detailed protocol(s) for data collection, data reduction and scoring
procedures, and incorporation into analyses. To facilitate data sharing, interoperability, and harmonization for

communities disproportionately burdened by environmental exposures. To achieve our mission and advance
the overall goals of the Center, the CEC will implement specific plans over the next 5 years. (1) We will
systematically integrate community voices spanning community members, policy-makers, public health
officials, healthcare professionals, and educators into Center academic forums, to more effectively
communicate diverse community issues and concerns to Center Members and inform and guide them in
developing research activities that address community needs. The CEC will build upon the successful EHS
Accelerator model to address priority community concerns that strengthen, mobilize, and expand outcomes from
the entire Center by sharing them with our diverse set of networks, including the NIEHS P30 Center Network and
Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Network, other regions of the PEHSU, the American Academy
of Pediatrics, and more. (2) We will work together with Center Members and our community partners to
translate and disseminate Center research results into environmental public health knowledge to
increase awareness and understanding of environmental health research being conducted at the Center
and inform needed change. The CEC will offer consultations to assist in the development of translational tools.
Together with regional and national partners, we will center EHS in programs and policies across diverse sectors
(clinical, medical education, community, and policy), as outlined in the NIEHS Translational Research
Framework, to ensure that low-income, predominantly Black and LatinX communities disproportionately
burdened by environmental exposures directly benefit from the knowledge gained from Center research. Finally,
(3) we will advance the field of community engagement and environmental health communication to
promote evidence-based models for national implementation and demonstrate impact through
measurable outcomes. Toward this end, the CEC works with a continually expanding network of partners to
accelerate change, address environmental health inequities, and promote health and well-being across the
lifespan."

The Pilot Projects Program (PPP) of the Mount Sinai P30 Center on “Health and Environment Across the
LifeSpan” provides funding for “start-up” research projects targeting important environmental health science
(EHS) issues, particularly those that fit our life course theme and research groups. The PPP is supplemented
with >$100,000 of institutional funding annually which allowed us to award an average of $397,000 (direct
costs) in EHS pilot grants annually this grant cycle. Going forward, in this proposal, we will partner with three
other NIH- funded Mount Sinai P30 Centers (i.e. Cancer, Aging, and Skin Biology), City University of New
York (CUNY), and our Clinical Translational Science Aware (CTSA) to co-fund EHS-focused pilot grants (e.g.,
aging and the environment, clinical translational environmental health). These partnerships not only further
augment EHS pilot grant funding, they also build new collaborations and attract researchers with no previous
EHS research experience to our Center. PPP applications are peer-reviewed using NIH review criteria and are
prioritized if 1) they are likely to lead to a larger extramural grant, 2) if the PI is an early stage investigator
(ESI); 3) if the proposal is a multi-PI grant with a postdoctoral fellow who pledges to use the project for a K
grant application, and 4) if the proposed pilot is a Community-Based Participatory Research project (CBPR). In
the Center's first 8 years, we distributed 78 pilots totaling ~$2.4 million. In return, these pilots have led to 43
NIH grant applications, 19 of which are already funded. We have doubled our NIEHS overall funding from
2018 to today, and tripled our NIEHS funding since the Center was founded. The PPP also enhances Facility
Core usage and provides a strong vehicle for career development. Our ESI support mechanisms have been
remarkably successful, with 48 of 78 funded pilot grants awarded to ESIs. Our Center has fueled many new
cross-disciplinary pilot grant collaborations among its Members, and Pilot Project PIs have come from multiple
departments, including Genetics (Drs. Faith and Pandey), Global Health (Dr. Vreeman), Oncology (Drs.
Muhammed and Lujambio), Otolaryngology (Dr. van Gerwen), Dermatology (Dr. Chipuk), Neuroscience (Dr.
Morishita), Pediatrics (Drs. Berin, Chu, Satlin), and Nephrology (Drs. Nadkarni and Zhou) among others.
These PIs had no prior EHS research experience before receiving a P30 pilot grant. Our CBPR funding set-
aside program and prioritization efforts increased CBPR funding from 3 grants in the Center's first 4 years, to
12 CBPR grants in the last 4 years. The PPP Core created many of the supports that accelerated our
remarkable growth over the Center's first 8 years. We have clearly demonstrated our ability to leverage pilot
grants for future NIH awards and to bring new investigators into EHS. Going forward, we will increase our total
outlay in pilot funding through cross-disciplinary partnerships with other Mount Sinai P30 Centers, CUNY and
our CTSA, ensuring that our Center expands into cross-disciplinary research programs, meets pressing EHS
research needs and engages communities while bringing EHS into greater regional and national attention."
10833626,"Most youth and adults in the U.S. do not meet recommended levels of physical activity, despite
the significant and extensive health benefits associated with being sufficiently active.
Interventions to increase physical activity are critical to improving an individuals' and population
health. However, generally efficacious interventions may not be consistently effective across
individuals. Personalized behavioral medicine in which interventions are tailored to the context
in which individuals are attempting to improve health behaviors remains a nascent field. Among
context factors, built and social environment factors within the home neighborhood are related
cross-sectionally to individuals' physical activity (e.g., residents in more walkable neighborhoods
are generally more active). However, cross-sectional observational studies do not identify
whether or which environmental factors are facilitators or barriers to attempts to increase
physical activity. The proposed InSPACE project examines whether and which home
neighborhood built and social environment factors affect individuals' response to physical
activity interventions. We propose to recruit and engage with 50+ physical activity intervention
trials across the country to generate comprehensive and consistent measures of objective built
(e.g., residential density) and social (e.g., median household income) neighborhood
environment linked to individual participants within each trial. Advances in the availability of
national spatial data and an innovative user-friendly tool to create and attribute environmental
measures to anywhere in the U.S. (the Automatic Context Measurement Tool) makes InSPACE
timely and feasible. Environmental, physical activity outcome, and demographic data will be
harmonized across trials and pooled to allow for robust testing of environmental effect
modification of physical activity intervention not possible within single trials. In addition, pooled
data will allow for testing of whether critical individual-level demographic factors, such as age
and race/ethnicity, interact with neighborhood environmental factors in affecting physical activity
intervention outcome. Guided by an expert scientific advisory council, findings from InSPACE
have the potential to rapidly and efficiently identify who will be responsive to existing efficacious
physical activity interventions in what contexts and encourage innovation in changing
interventions to better match individuals' environmental contexts when attempting to increase
physical activity."

10799562,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
The mu opioid receptor (MOR) is widely expressed throughout the nervous system and mediates both analgesic
and addictive effects of opioids. Despite the current opioid crisis in the United States, opioid drugs offer
unparalleled analgesic efficacy and are prescribed for a variety of pain conditions. To dissociate opioid analgesic
and addictive effects, it is essential to determine which neural circuits and cell types mediate each of these
effects. MOR signaling in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is of particular significance due to the mPFC function
as a key integrative node in ascending and descending pain circuits and its strong connectivity to subcortical
reward circuitry. However, how opioids eventually alter the activity of glutamatergic mPFC output neurons to
modulate opioid addiction and pain behaviors is unknown. The main outputs of the cortex include two distinct
populations of layer 5 glutamatergic projection neurons: intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) neurons.
IT neurons predominantly project intracortically and to striatum, while PT neurons project broadly and are poised
to directly modulate neural activity throughout the brain. Despite evidence supporting a MOR-dependent role for
mPFC in pain and addiction, preliminary data suggest that MOR is not expressed directly on IT or PT cells.
This project aims to (1) determine how opioid exposure impacts mPFC IT and PT cell activity in mice and (2)
delineate the contribution of mPFC IT and PT cells to opioid addiction and analgesia. In order to determine how
opioids modulate IT and PT cell activity, dual-color calcium imaging will be used as a proxy for neuronal activity.
Neural dynamics of each population will be characterized at baseline, during acute and chronic morphine
exposure through subcutaneously implanted pumps, and during naloxone-precipitated withdrawal. To assess
the contribution of IT and PT cells to opioid addiction, mPFC IT or PT cell activity will be chemogenetically
suppressed in addiction models including morphine conditioned place preference and oxycodone self-
administration. Finally, the contribution of IT and PT cells to morphine analgesia and opioid-induced tolerance
and hyperalgesia will be assessed through chemogenetic suppression of mPFC IT or PT cells after acute and
chronic morphine exposure in assays for thermal (hotplate) and mechanical (von Frey) pain. This project will
establish foundational knowledge in the dissociation of the addictive and analgesic effects of opioids,
illuminating targets for nonaddictive pain therapies.
Through this research proposal and associated training plan, I will gain excellent training in neuroanatomy,
addiction and pain behaviors, and neural dynamics in a supportive training environment at the University of North
Carolina MD/PhD Program. This training will provide me with the technical and professional skills necessary to
become a leader at an academic medical center and pursue my goals of practicing pain medicine and
researching innovative non-addictive therapies for pain as a physician-scientist."
10770382,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aging changes the adult brain at the molecular and cellular levels, driving cognitive impairments and drastically
increasing susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Our lab, and others, have
shown that broad systemic manipulations, such as heterochronic parabiosis, young blood plasma and exercise
plasma administration can improve learning and memory cognitive functions in aged mice. Collectively, these
findings raise the exciting possibility for systemic factors to restore brain function in aging with potential
applications for degenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease. Our lab recently described a liver-to-
brain axis, in which administration of blood plasma derived from voluntary exercised mice exerts beneficial
effects on the aged hippocampus, in part, through liver-derived circulating blood factors. In particular, we
identified Glycosylphosphatidylinositol Specific Phospholipase D1 (Gpld1) – a plasma enzyme that cleaves GPI-
anchored proteins (GPI-AP) from the cell surface – as an exercise-induced, liver-derived blood factor in aged
mice and active elderly humans. Selectively increasing systemic Gpld1 was sufficient to restore learning and
memory cognitive functions in the hippocampus of aged mice. While these exciting findings support a potential
therapeutic role for systemic Gpld1 in aging, its cellular and molecular targets remain largely elusive.
Surprisingly, our findings indicate that Gpld1 does not readily enter the brain, suggesting an indirect mechanism
of action. Interestingly, GPI-APs are enriched on endothelial cells, raising the possibility that Gpld1 may be acting
on the brain vasculature to improve cognition in the aged brain. Indeed, my preliminary data indicate that
systemic Gpld1 restores expression of the GPI-anchored phosphatase ALPL, a regulator of vascular function, to
more youthful levels on hippocampal blood vessels of aged mice. The purpose of this proposed study is to
investigate the effect of systemic Gpld1 on the brain vasculature, as a critical mediator of its benefits on the aged
brain. I hypothesize that targeting vascular GPI-anchored Gpld1 substrates ameliorates age-related vascular
dysfunction and rejuvenates cognitive function in the aged hippocampus. This will be investigated with two
Specific Aims: 1) Investigate the effects of increasing systemic Gpld1 on vascular dysfunction in the aged
hippocampus. 2) Determine the rejuvenating potential of targeting the GPI-anchored Gpld1 substrate ALPL on
cognitive function in the aged hippocampus. Ultimately, these studies will have significant translational potential,
identifying molecular and cellular mechanisms downstream of Gpld1 as novel therapeutic targets to counter
cognitive impairments in the aging brain and aging-associated neurodegenerative diseases, including
Alzheimer’s disease."
10939176,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Vision is a dynamic process, constantly encoding visual stimuli that depend on both one's self motion and the
ever changing visual scene. Past studies have suggested that locomotion modulates visual processing in
numerous brain regions, contributing to modulations of gain, spatial resolution processing, and potentially
attentional state, to name a few. The caveat of many of these investigations is that they were performed in
restrained experimental conditions that limited animals to head-fixation and limited locomotion on a spherical
treadmill. Therefore, the impact of natural, freely moving locomotion on visual processing remains unknown.
We have developed methods to record visual responses during free movement. We will apply this to
investigate how two key visual brain regions, primary visual cortex (V1) and superior colliculus (SC) are
modulated by natural locomotion, and compare two distinct experimental in vivo electrophysiology conditions:
head-fixed and natural locomotion. In Aim 1, I will use in vivo electrophysiology in V1 to analyze visual
responses in both experimental conditions as well as specifically analyzing the impact of locomotion on
suppressed-by-contrast cells. In Aim 2, I will use in vivo electrophysiology in SC to analyze visual responses in
both experimental conditions and compare the locomotor modulation of narrow-field vertical neurons and wide-
field vertical neurons. Together, these aims will determine the impact of natural locomotion on visual
processing in V1 and SC on a global level and at a cell type specific level. The proposed experiments will also
inform future studies aimed at dissecting the neural circuits underlying natural vision and provide experimental
paradigms that may be utilized to study free moving visual neuroscience in a variety of tasks."
10823220,"Emerging evidence implicates a pivotal role of cerebral inflammation in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke.
Microglia and macrophages (Mi/MΦ) are important mediators of post-stroke neuroinflammation and assume
diverse functional states in response to specific microenvironmental signals, thereby regulating inflammation,
injury progression, and brain repair. The key molecular switches and networks that determine the overall
functional state of Mi/MΦ after stroke are poorly understood. Identification of these signaling mechanisms may
reveal novel therapeutic targets to improve long-term stroke outcomes by boosting beneficial Mi/MΦ functions
and harnessing the power of restorative neuroinflammation.
Signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) is a transcription factor that is potently activated in
canonical interferon signaling and defined as an important mediator of macrophage M1 polarization. Despite
clear implication in regulating immune responses, the role of STAT1 in ischemic stroke has been studied solely
for its contribution to acute neuronal death during the first 24 hours. To date, how STAT1 controls Mi/MΦ function
under the temporally evolving long-term recovery period, the primary endpoint of clinical stroke, is unknown.
Our pilot studies show for the first time that: 1) STAT1 is activated (phosphorylated) primarily in Mi/MΦ at the
subacute stage (1-5 days) after transient focal cerebral ischemia (tFCI). 2) Mi/MΦ-specific knockout (mKO) of
STAT1 does not reduce acute brain infarct yet improves long-term outcomes after tFCI in mice of both sexes. 3)
Uniquely, STAT1 mKO not only downregulates proinflammatory genes in post-tFCI Mi/MΦ, but also elevates a
panel of pro-repair genes, including Arginase 1, a key protective and pro-repair factor. 4) Intraperitoneal
administration of fludarabine, a brain-penetrant and selective STAT1 inhibitor, upregulates Arginase 1 in Mi/MΦ,
alleviates the brain invasion of peripheral immune cells, and improves both short-term and long-term outcomes
after tFCI. Given these observations, we propose three specific aims to test the novel central hypothesis that
genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of STAT1 improves long-term outcomes after ischemic stroke
by promoting inflammation-resolving and pro-repair microglial/macrophage responses.
Aim 1: Test if inducible deletion of STAT1 selectively in Mi/MΦ improves long-term stroke outcomes. Mice with
tamoxifen-inducible STAT1 knockout in Mi/MΦ will be subjected to tFCI induced by 1-h middle cerebral artery
occlusion (MCAO). Outcomes will be assessed for 5 weeks after tFCI. Aim 2: Test if STAT1 knockout alleviates
proinflammatory Mi/MΦ responses but promotes the beneficial pro-resolving/pro-repair activities of Mi/MΦ via
Arginase 1 signaling, using the in vivo tFCI model and in vitro primary cultures and co-cultures. We will also test
if Mi/MΦ-specific overexpression of Arginase 1 boosts pro-repair Mi/MΦ responses and neurological recovery
after tFCI. Aim 3: Test the therapeutic potential of the selective STAT1 inhibitor fludarabine in long-term (5 weeks)
stroke outcomes in young adult and aged mice (20 months old) of both sexes following STAIR guidelines."
10909814,"The proposed randomized control trial will examine the efficacy of a brief behavioral treatment for reducing
suicidal ideation and for increasing reasons for living in older Veterans at risk for suicide. Two common issues
in older adults, functional disability and executive dysfunction, increase suicide risk and will be examined as
moderators and mediators of treatment outcomes. The proposed study will examine Problem Solving Therapy
(PST) using a protocol that teaches skills to address emotional and practical barriers to effective problem
solving. The VA usual care practice of collaborative safety planning will be the control condition, herein referred
to as enhanced usual care (EUC). For participant safety, Veterans enrolled in PST will also receive EUC. The
study design is random assignment to the treatment, PST plus EUC, or the control condition, EUC only. Both
the treatment and the control are evidence-based interventions delivered in six sessions. The study will occur
at VA Palo Alto (primary site) and VA Syracuse/VA Canandaigua (secondary site).
 Longitudinal assessment of suicidal ideation and reasons for living will occur at eleven timepoints:
baseline, after each of the six weekly treatment sessions, posttreatment (7 weeks), at 1-, 3-, and 6-
month follow-up. The recruitment goal is 150 Veterans over a five-year period with 75 participants
randomized to each treatment. Veterans must be 60 years or older, report suicide ideation, and meet
diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and/or posttraumatic stress disorder to be
eligible. Veterans will be excluded and referred for other services if they have psychotic symptoms,
bipolar disorder, severe OCD, or elevated symptoms indicative of borderline personality disorder; an
alcohol/substance use disorder; severe or unstable medical conditions; recent head injury (past year)
or history of a head injury with loss of consciousness for 24 or more hours; terminal illness; positive
cognitive screen indicative of possible dementia; or if they are unable to participate in the study or
follow-up sessions. Recruitment will occur through multiple strategies at VA, Vet centers, and in the
community to ensure the feasibility of recruiting a total of 75 Veterans at each site. To meet this recruitment
goal, the primary and secondary site will each enroll 2 to 3 Veterans per month.
 Fidelity ratings of audiotaped treatment sessions will be made by independent raters on 20% of sessions.
Mixed effects modeling will be used to estimate the effect of treatment versus the control for the outcomes of
suicidal ideation and reasons for living. Models will covary for demographics, medical and psychiatric
comorbidity, and psychotropic use. For the primary aim, models will determine whether PST plus EUC is
associated with a larger treatment effect compared with EUC only for suicidal ideation and reasons for living.
Secondary aims will determine if baseline functional disability and executive dysfunction moderate treatment
outcomes, and whether a change in these two variables from baseline to posttreatment are significantly
associated with (mediate) change in suicidal ideation and reasons for living. The tertiary aims will use
qualitative methods to assess Veteran satisfaction with the treatment and control including the types of
problems with which treatment helped them, and suggestions for improving it for future Veterans. The current
VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) for suicide do not list treatment options specifically for older
Veterans despite the majority of VHA patients being 55 years or older. Thus, evidence-based outcomes from
the proposed work have potential to inform the CPG recommendations for using PST with Safety Planning
and/or Safety Planning alone with older Veterans. Dissemination of the treatment could be supported by
expanding existing VA training infrastructure in problem solving based interventions."
10840368,"Project Summary/Abstract
All tumors contain a mixture of different cell types. Within the malignant cell population, clonal evolution
leads to the emergence of clones with different genetic lesions, and various biological processes shape
the co-occurrence of different cell states that are characterized by specific transcriptional/epigenetic
landscapes. This heterogeneity underlies the persistence of small populations of tumor cells through
treatment, leading to disease recurrence, which is a major clinical challenge. To better understand clonal
structures and transcriptional/epigenetic states in primary human tumors, there is an unmet need for
technologies that comprehensively profile these modalities at single-cell resolution. The PI/PDs Peter
van Galen and Vijay Sankaran have pioneered the use of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants as
naturally occurring cell barcodes to reconstruct clonal relationships between cells, and demonstrate
simultaneous profiling of transcriptional (scRNA-seq) and epigenetic (scATAC-seq) cell states. As such,
they are uniquely positioned to realize the potential of these technologies to illuminate the complex tumor
ecosystem and identify vulnerabilities of different malignant cell types. The long-term goal of this
research is to guide new therapeutic approaches that can effectively eradicate heterogeneous tumor
cells. The overall objective is to establish enabling technologies that can be used across a wide range of
tumors to transform our understanding of cancer biology. Drs. Van Galen and Sankaran, supported by a
strong network of collaborators, will jointly work towards this objective through two specific aims: 1)
Advance and validate experimental methods to simultaneously dissect the transcriptome, epigenome,
and clonal structures in cancer and 2) Proof-of-principle profiling of acute myeloid leukemia clones at
diagnosis that subsequently drive recurrence. In the first Aim, the investigators will build on their recent
accomplishments to establish optimized and validated procedures for multi-omic analysis of primary
human cancer cells with clear performance measures. In the second Aim, paired diagnosis-relapse
samples from a well-defined cohort of acute myeloid leukemia patients will be analyzed to demonstrate
the simultaneous dissection of longitudinal patterns of clonal evolution with transcriptional/epigenetic cell
states - a key proof-of-principle for this technology. The approach is innovative by leveraging naturally
occurring mtDNA variants to layer clonal relationships onto current state-of-the-art assays for single-cell
analysis. The proposed research is significant because the successful completion of the project would
equip the scientific community with new tools for the comprehensive molecular/cellular characterization
of cancer. The expected output is a repeatable, reliable approach for single-cell analysis of primary
human cancer cells at three core modalities, yielding transcriptional, epigenetic, and clonal resolution.
This will be enabling for NCI-funded projects in a range of tumor systems."
10818351,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acts of school violence have increased over the past decade and over 20% of students report being bullied at
school. School violence has a far-reaching impact on the entire school population, including staff, students and
families. It was noted that the largest crime-prevention results occurred when youth at elevated risk were given
effective prevention programs. As such, there is a critical need for developing a rapid and accurate approach to
interview students, assess their risk characteristics, and provide supportive evidence for prevention.
Our study focuses on detecting and preventing youth aggression, the predominant form of school violence.
Several risk assessment scales, ranging from simple clinical impressions to structured professional judgments,
have been proposed to identify youth violence. However, these assessments heavily rely on clinicians' subjec-
tive impressions and their predictive validities remain a major issue. In addition, none of the risk assessments
include direct analysis of the words (language) used by students and hence, provide little information to sup-
port subsequent prevention. Our long-term goal is to develop an Automated RIsk Assessment (ARIA) system
to analyze participant interviews, detect elevated-risk students, and provide risk characteristics (e.g., impul-
sivity, negative thoughts) to assist prevention. In our earlier study we developed a risk assessment approach to
interview students and evaluate their risk of aggression. The overall objective of this study is to validate our risk
assessment approach with real-world evidence, and to develop an AIRA system to automate the assessment
process. We hypothesize that our risk assessment approach will have sufficient predictive validity in predicting
aggression at school, and a computerized system leveraging machine learning and natural language pro-
cessing (NLP) will be able to detect high-risk students, identify violence-related predictors from linguistic con-
tent, and improve subsequent prevention by assisting recommendations. The hypothesis will be tested by pur-
suing three specific aims: 1) Evaluate the predictive validity and generalizability of our risk assessment
approach with prospectively collected school-based outcomes; 2) Develop a high-performing ARIA system
to identify risk characteristics and predict risk of school violence; and 3) Compare actionable recommenda-
tions and school outcomes with and without using the ARIA system in a prospective observational study.
The study is highly innovative in that it will be among the first efforts that leverage NLP and machine learning to
analyze interviews, identify risk characteristics from student language, and predict violence outcomes. The study
will have a significant impact on several fronts. Successful validation of our risk assessment approach on multiple
sites (Aim 1) will provide a valid mechanism to detect youth aggression at school. The AIRA system developed
in Aim 2 will enable accurate and scalable risk screening for individual students. Aim 3 is a bench-to-practice
translational aim to rapidly transfer our findings to clinical practice. The study will help establish a nationwide
solution for school violence risk assessment, which will benefit healthcare institutions, schools, and students."
10814165,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hematopoiesis is responsible for producing the varied cell types found in blood. In adults, this process primarily
takes place in the bone marrow and is characterized by successive rounds of differentiation beginning with the
hematopoietic stem cell through to lineage commitment. This process involves progressive narrowing of lineage
potency as progenitors eventually commit to the production of a single cell lineage. Disruption of hematopoiesis
can lead to benign and malignant pathologies. We focus on the bipotent megakaryocytic-erythroid progenitor
(MEP), which has the potential to differentiate into a lineage committed erythroid progenitor (ErP) or a lineage
committed megakaryocytic progenitor (MkP). MEP fate specification has been studied to a limited extent,
uncovering only a small number of influences that contribute to this process. One understudied aspect of human
MEP fate specification is the role of epigenetics. KDM1A (LSD1) is known to be important for erythroid
maturation, but its role in MEP fate specification is unknown. Preliminary data using primary human cells show
that inhibition of LSD1 in primary human ErP results in the ability of erythroid committed progenitors to undergo
granulocytic-monocytic and megakaryocytic commitment. In contrast, LSD1 inhibition does not affect MkP
commitment to the megakaryocytic fate. This suggests that LSD1 only antagonizes alternative lineage potential
during erythropoiesis, and not megakaryopoiesis, even though LSD1 mRNA is expressed at similar levels in
MEP, ErP, and MkP. The goal of this proposal is to establish the mechanism by which LSD1 promotes erythroid
commitment while silencing alternative myeloid and megakaryocytic lineage potential. I will achieve these goals
utilizing a mix of functional (cell culture), genetic and epigenetic approaches to determine where and how LSD1
regulates gene expression and fate specification in MEP, ErP, and MkP. Computational analyses will determine
candidate gene targets, and potential genomic sites to force epigenetic modifications using different fusion
proteins based on the catalytically inactive Cas9 endonuclease (dCas9). These results will establish the
epigenetic mechanisms that govern erythroid lineage commitment mediated by LSD1. They will also shed light
on the distinct lineage-specific epigenetic mechanisms that mediate and maintain fate specification in
hematopoiesis."

Community engagement is a strong focus of the proposed Resource, emphasized during all
aspects of the proposed BTRR activities through the Driving Biomedical Projects, Collaboration
and Services projects, workshops, a robust web presence, hands-on training and rapid
dissemination of results and capabilities. The Community Engagement goals are to involve the
research community throughout the Technology Research and Development process from initial
design and development strategies, testing and feedback, and training, with the ultimate goal to
provide the broadest possible access to Resource technologies bringing those technologies into
the community for use as quickly and effectively as possible. The proposed aspects of Training,
Collaborations, Service, and Dissemination work towards these goals.
The developed technologies will be made available to any and all users of the SSRL and LCLS
National User Facilities which will ensure a long-term sustainable access to the developed BTRR
capabilities. The access thus enabled will be complemented by reaching out to scientists who
could benefit from the developed technologies via conference attendance, workshop and remote
training as well as detailed website. This will ensure that access is provided to a qualified and
renewable community with challenging biomedical problems. Specific collaboration projects are
identified as an initial community of users who will benefit greatly from the proposed BTRR
developments and BTRR staff will work directly with these groups to ensure technologies are
robust for general use.
A continuous effort to evaluate and improve the community engagement tools will ensure the best

11084122,"Project Summary – Developmental Research Project Program 
The overall mission of the Developmental Research Project Program (DRPP) is to execute a competitive Pilot 
Project research program that leads to research independence and further builds research capability, capacity and 
engagement in DE-INBRE thematic areas of cancer, cardiovascular and neuroscience. The DRPP’s goal is to ensure 
that Delaware takes the next major step toward the State’s goal of building a diverse, self-sustaining biomedical 
research enterprise, thereby improving health care and promoting health-based economic development. 
The DE-INBRE DRPP’s support of Pilot Project investigators has been a key resource for establishing research 
capabilities across the state. The DRPP is primarily intended to support the efforts of Delaware’s junior biomedical 
investigators to become independent investigators. The pilot program employs novel approaches to increase the 
research opportunities for young faculty. 
Under the ongoing program, the Research Independence Award provides support to a cohort of new and/or early- 
stage investigators. The goal is for the junior investigator to effectively utilize the resources of Delaware’s biomedical 
research network – as well as the scientific and technical strengths of collaborating investigators and/or mentors 
to engage undergraduate students – while the investigator advances towards obtaining research independence by 
receiving an NIH R01 or institutionally equivalent award. 
In INBRE IV, a new Research Engagement Award mechanism targeting the NIH R15-like grants will be implemented. 
The purpose is to increase the collaborative research engagement of faculty and undergraduate students at 
Delaware’s Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs). It is intended to serve as a stepping stone towards research 
independence for PUI faculty to obtain NIH R15 or like funding, to compete effectively for the DRPP Research 
Independence Award, and to ultimately obtain research independence. 
Specific Aims 
 1. Build and strengthen Delaware’s biomedical research capacity and capability in cancer, cardiovascular health, 
 and neuroscience within the DE-INBRE network. 
 2. Increase the research base of investigators receiving grant funding in cancer, cardiovascular health, and 
neuroscience. 
 3. Engage investigators and students at Delaware’s PUIs with key network resources."

biomarker technologies based on fast multi-modal multi-contrast imaging and spectroscopy approaches, as
well as the training in their use.
Daily operation of all aspects of the NCBIB is the responsibility of the MPIs of this core, Drs. Peter van Zijl and
Hanzhang Lu, both experts in magnetic resonance technology development with longstanding experience in
managing NIH grants and multicenter and multi-disciplinary collaborations. They head the Resource Executive
Committee in which they will manage this task through close interaction with the other PIs heading the four
technical research and development (TRD) projects. The full committee meets bimonthly or whenever
necessary. The TRD PIs are all in close proximity and meet/interact closely at least on a weekly basis. The
general goals of the Resource are formulated by this Executive Committee with guidance from the internal and
external advisory committees. The main goal is to create an environment that allows biomarker technology
development through the push-pull interaction between the physicists and engineers of the TRDs and the
application scientists and clinicians heading the collaborative projects. In addition, the Resource supports
many service projects as test beds of the methodology in important areas of application. The committee also
assures that technology is further disseminated through presentations, training courses, and software and data
transfer to interested sites (See Training and Dissemination Section).
The Resource has a set of carefully designed operating procedures to establish the above-mentioned
collaborative and service projects and for the management of the facilities in terms of safety and equitable
access to the scanners and facilities. Plans for long-term maintenance of the facility assure that the NCBIB can
function successfully.
The progress of the Resource will be overseen by an External Advisory Committee (EAC) consisting of experts
in biomarker development and in the technical fields of our TRDs. This committee will meet annually to advise
on scientific progress and on the progress of the center in terms of its goals of collaboration, service, training
and dissemination. A yearly report will be submitted to NIBIB as part of the annual progress report. In addition
to the EAC, we have several local committees that provide oversight, including a protocol review committee
that evaluates all research projects in terms of human safety and research quality.
The Resource has very strong institutional support, as outlined in letters by the president of Kennedy Krieger
Institute and the Chairs of Radiology and Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University."

Lead Principal investigator: Peter van Zijl, Professor of Radiology
Co-investigators: Xu Li, Manisha Aggarwal, Hye-Young Heo, Jeremias Sulam, Susumu Mori
Consultant: Filip Szczepankiewicz (Lund University)
While TRDs 1 and 2 focus on MR approaches that measure actual physiological constants and metabolite
 signals, the definition of a Quantitative Imaging Biomarker (QIB) goes much further. In TRD3 we therefore
 exploit the inherent power of MRI to probe tissue composition and microstructure, the characteristics of
 which can be accessed through a multitude of MRI phenomena and parameters that can be seen as
 candidate biomarkers. The intensity and frequency of the water signal in an MRI voxel depend on the
 local microscopic fields and field differences imposed by tissue compartments and molecules. In addition,
 the motion of water measured by MRI is affected by compartment size and permeability, which may
 change in disease and thus contain potential biomarker information. The overall goal of this TRD is to
 design pulse sequences and analysis approaches to efficiently quantify MRI parameters that assess
 tissue composition and microstructure. We have the following specific aims:
AIM 1: Development of compartmental filtering and diffusional encoding methods to probe tissue
microstructure.
AIM 2: Development of integrated susceptibility and diffusion tensor imaging (STI and DTI) for fiber
 tractography, aiming at high resolution white matter fiber tractography in vivo. Gray matter iron content
 and blood oxygenation will also be assessed from these high-resolution susceptibility images
AIM 3: Development of fast multi-parameter acquisition and analysis approaches for simultaneous
 quantification of the MR-derived parameters in Aims 1 and 2 plus T1, T2(*), and Magnetization Transfer
 Ratio (MTR).
The parameters obtained will be used to synthetically generate multiple image contrasts (synthetic MRI),
including conventional ones with which the radiologists are familiar for reading and that currently can be
acquired only separately. Eight CPs will be involved in optimizing the methods and testing these approaches
for biomarker potential. Eight SPs will use them to extend the information content in their studies. The
developed tissue markers together with the diagnostic parameters of TRD1 and TRD2 will be made available
to TRD4, which will develop statistical and deep learning technologies to combine them and make them
available in age-dependent multi-parameter brain atlases."
10828792,"TRD 4: Platforms for multi-modal and multi-scale imaging data
Lead Principal investigator: Susumu Mori, Professor of Radiology; Co-Principal investigators: Brian Caffo,
Professor of Biostatistics; Jeremias Sulam, Assistant professor of Biomedical Engineering
Co-investigators: Andreia Faria, Michael Miller, Tilak Ratnanather, Laurent Younes
The role of TRD4 is to develop new technologies and platforms to integrate and analyze complex multi-modal
and multi-scale imaging data via collaboration with other TRDs and CPs. In the past two decades, we have
witnessed remarkable advances in image acquisition, processing, and analysis technologies for brain MRI. As
we enter a new decade, however, there remain several key areas in combining information across the macro-
meso-micro scales, and discovering predictive models for which we require significant advances in existing
tools and technologies. One of the significant opportunities going forward is to leverage the rapidly evolving
data science technologies which are now emerging and opening new frontiers for researchers. This will require
advances not only in collections of software to analyze each dimension but also a new generalized framework
to integrate and explore the data. Another important development in recent years is the surge of heavily data-
driven approaches such as deep learning. We believe this is a great time to invest time and resources to
evaluate their capability by comparing them with conventional engineering approaches. More importantly, there
is great potential in combining these two approaches to test improvements in precision, accuracy, and/or
efficiency. We are uniquely positioned to take a lead in this sphere by leveraging our experiences and
resources (tools and data) accumulated in the past 20 years. Our specific aims will be: (1) To integrate and test
deep learning (DL) approaches in image data acquisitions and analyses to solve inverse problems for
estimation of latent variables in brain MRI. These variables include enhancement of SNR, anatomical
resolutions, and underlying anatomical features such as axonal alignments; (2) To develop technologies and
platforms for characterizing models that predict the key factors determining brain diseases by integrating
multiple imaging modalities, time-domain data, and non-imaging information through statistics. Our models will
focus on etiology, pathology and prognosis considering retrospective, cross-sectional and prospective data; (3)
To integrate DL approaches to brain mapping strategies such as registration, image segmentation, and lesion
detections. Using our rich resources for annotated image libraries (atlases), conventional segmentation /
detection tools, and expertise, we will develop DL-based approaches and evaluate their efficacy, including
comparison with conventional approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Improvement of the
performance by combining these two approaches will be tested. Furthermore, we will develop a framework for
diffeomorphic image registration that can incorporate extracted features (i.e. labels and lesions) to perform
brain mapping of cases with severe pathological conditions."
10827418,"Abstract - CURATION COMPONENT
The utility of the Gene Expression Database for Mouse Development (GXD) is proportional to its data content,
the quality of data annotations, and the level of data integration that we provide. To foster GXD’s mission to
facilitate insights into molecular mechanisms of development, differentiation and disease, the Curation
Component will continue and expand GXD’s curation of expression data and anatomical ontologies and ensure
high-quality data annotation and integration.
We will (1) continue the curation of classical types of expression data. We will collect and integrate
expression data from RNA in situ hybridization, in situ reporter knock-in, immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR,
Northern blot and Western blot experiments. Data will be acquired from the literature, via electronic data
submissions from laboratories, and by collaborations with projects that generate these data at a large scale.
We will continue to ensure high-quality data annotation and integration through our editorial processes and
quality controls. We will (2) continue and expand the curation of whole genome expression assays. Using
the detailed controlled vocabularies and ontologies employed in GXD/MGI, we will annotate GXD-relevant bulk
and single-cell RNA-seq and microarray expression data sets from GEO and ArrayExpress by attributes of the
samples used, thus maintaining and expanding GXD’s up-to-date, searchable index to allow researchers to
effectively find data sets of interest. We will continue to select consistently-processed, high-quality RNA-seq
expression data sets from EBI’s Expression Atlas for inclusion in GXD. We will (3) continue the curation of
anatomical ontologies and incorporate new anatomical concepts and relationships. We will enhance
and refine the Mouse Developmental Anatomy Ontology and add “develops-from” relationships between
anatomical structures of successive developmental stages to enable the analysis of differentiation pathways.
We will maintain and refine the integration of expression and phenotypic data by referencing common
anatomical objects, thus enhancing our tools for the direct anatomy-based comparison of expression,
phenotype, and disease data. We will begin to annotate expression data at the cell type level by combining
anatomy and cell ontology terms. We will extend the cell type (CL) ontology as needed by our annotation of
expression data, in collaboration with the CL developers."
10827422,"Abstract - TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT COMPONENT
The Technology Development Component of the Gene Expression Database project (GXD) delivers to users
the integrated expression data generated by Curation and Computation Components, via an intuitive and
versatile web navigation paradigm. Users can refine their expression data searches in many ways (by
properties of the mouse sample and/or by properties of the gene studied), and the summary of their search
results has links to a variety of associated data (images, references, specimens, etc.). GXD provides an
integrated combination of expression data from classical expression studies (RNA in situ hybridization and
immunohistochemistry assays, northern blot, western blot and RT-PCR experiments) with high throughput
RNA-Seq (HT) data, such that a user's search returns data from both classical and HT studies. This is a rare
feature among expression resources, and it allows users to seamlessly exchange between these assay types,
fostering comparison and confirmation. The Technology Development Component has four major parts (Aims)
that can be sub-divided into interface components that deliver the following features: (1) Providing new ways to
search and view expression results by mouse developmental anatomy. These include searches for genes
expressed in tissues that follow differentiation paths and genes expressed in highly resolved cell types. (2)
Adding new search and display functions for quantitative expression analyses, comparisons and profiling. This
will give users ready access to gene sets that show altered expression patterns between defined sample states
(between wild type and specific mutants, for example). (3) Providing graphical views of complex expression
data, such as GXD's tissue x stage and tissue x gene matrices, and interactive RNA-Seq heat maps, to help
users interpret expansive, integrated expression results. (4) Expanding the ability to analyze gene expression
in the context of important biological concepts, such as gene function, phenotype and disease associations,
and biological source parameters (like, tissue, stage and genotype), and adding a critical co-expression
perspective to biological pathway and protein-protein interaction data by integrating with GXD data (genes
must be co-expressed in the same cell, for their gene products to interact). (5) Enhancing users’ ability to
compare expression between mouse and other important developmental species, such as zebra fish, frog and
chicken. And lastly, (6) Allowing users to access GXD data for their own lists of genes and to use their GXD
search results at other resources. All interface Aims proposed will be developed and administered with a
balance of function and performance to ensure a productive GXD user experience."
10885000,"Implicit bias (IB) negatively impacts the medical care and health outcomes of Black patients.
Physician IB compromises the quality of patient-physician communication, eroding trust and
confidence, impairing treatment decisions and adherence, and causing patient harm. Studies
show that non-Black physicians, on average, have moderate levels of IB toward Black patients.
Since most Black patients see non-Black physicians, this means that most Black patients see
physicians with IB towards them. The main way in which IB is communicated and reinforced is
via paraverbal behaviors (i.e., how people deliver speech, such as tone, pitch, volume) and non-
verbal behaviors (i.e., how people use their body, such as eye gaze, hand gestures, and body
leaning), as opposed to verbal behaviors (i.e., what people say) during interactions. Current IB
training is ineffective because they rely on relatively brief interventions that seek only to in-
crease physicians’ awareness about their having IB. While this is a necessary first step, by itself
it is insufficient. IB training must also show learners the behaviors they unwittingly display due to
their IB, and teach them concrete remediation strategies.
MCI’s work under this grant will produce the first-ever effective IB training system. MPathic-
IBCH is a new AI-based technology that will enhance two-way communication using adaptable
virtual human (VH) interactions, and present detailed, actionable, personalized feedback on
learners’ unwitting display of negative nonverbal and paraverbal behaviors. To recognize se-
lected facial expressions associated with learner IB, MCI will implement a proprietary system
based on the Emotion Facial Action Coding System (EMFACS) which analyzes combinations of
facial action units for real-time emotional state analysis. We will further enhance the responsive-
ness of VHs with an EMFACS-based facial rigging design that parallels the detection design.
This SBIR FastTrack will accomplish this by: (Ph1-1) Identifying key paraverbal and nonver-
bal communication behaviors systematically associated with pro-White/anti-Black IB. (PH1-2)
Developing and evaluating an MPathic-IBCH prototype to capture a key communication behav-
ior identified in prior research and to differentiate medical students based on their race IB levels;
(Ph2-1) Developing and integrating MPathic-IBCH into a blended IB/Cultural Humility curricu-
lum; (Ph2-2) Building MPathic-IBCH into a fully-featured, web-deployable application with im-
proved nonverbal and speech prosody detection, AI, 3 full scenarios, and integrating it into a
learning environment; and, (Ph2-3) Deploying blended curriculum with MPathic-IBCH and evalu-
ating the effects on student learning, communication behaviors, and attitudes as measured by
SP performance ratings, scores within MPathic-IBCH, and self-reflections and experiences."
10788372,"ABSTRACT
A major problem facing both physicians and men with metastatic prostate cancer is predicting whether a
specific therapy will be effective. Currently, when a man develops metastatic castration resistant prostate
cancer, the initial therapy is frequently an inhibitor of androgen receptor activity such as enzalutamide or
abiraterone acetate. Following progression on hormonal therapies, taxane-based chemotherapy is frequently
employed. While these therapies improve overall survival and delay progression, there is great heterogeneity
between patients in the chances of clinical benefit, as defined by response rates and durations of responses.
While most men develop resistance to these second generation hormonal therapies within 1-2 years, some
men derive many years of benefit, while others do not respond or respond only transiently. Thus, an unmet
need is the ability to identify those men most likely to have durable benefits from these therapies, while sparing
those men unlikely to benefit the costs and toxicities associated with these agents. Predictive biomarkers
provide such an opportunity to optimize care delivery in this setting and reduce the heterogeneity of this
disease. In addition, such biomarkers will permit the design of novel approaches and clinical studies designed
to improve outcomes in those men in greatest need."

The NIMH T32 Traumatic Stress Research Program’s primary goal is to equip postdoctoral fellows with the
research skills, resources, and opportunities necessary for their development into independent translational
and clinical scientists producing mental health research that will have a transformative influence on the
traumatic stress field and public health. Housed in the National Crime Victims Research and Treatment Center
(NCVC) at MUSC, the program has trained postdoctoral fellows in state-of-the-art scientific methods in
traumatic stress research—in both child and adult populations—for the past 34 years. This application
proposes 5 years program continuation (Years 36-40) and seeks support for six postdoctoral positions of two-
year duration. Through mentorship and training with a large number of talented and prolific faculty who have
made a career commitment to traumatic stress-related mental health research and its associated sequelae, the
program’s objectives are to develop competence in several areas: a) sampling methods and data collection
modes; b) familiarity in the measurement and integration of neural, psychophysiological, and behavioral units
of analysis; c) foundational skills in working with ‘big data’; d) ethical and cultural issues in trauma research; e)
development, evaluation, and implementation of effective interventions; and f) translating findings for public
policy. Fellows select specialized training in one of two research tracks—Epidemiology Risk and Resiliency or
Treatment Development, Evaluation, and Dissemination/Implementation. Training is outlined in each fellow’s
Individual Development Plan and guided by the fellow’s selection of a Primary Mentor among our diverse
Program Faculty at MUSC leading timely studies in the area of traumatic stress, as well as a Secondary
Mentor from among other MUSC faculty and additional academic institutions. Secondary Mentors add great
breadth to training opportunities through their complementary expertise in areas of science spanning:
addiction, brain stimulation, neuroimaging, genetics, dissemination and implementation science, health
disparities, psychopharmacology, and HIV. Fellows also benefit from a full array of core, selective, and elective
training options that include course work, workshops, training in the responsible conduct of research, diversity
training, and retreats. The caliber of the program is clearly reflected in the record of notable accomplishments
and scientific contributions made by its previous fellows, both within the most recent 5-year funding period and
over its 34-year duration: 100% of fellows who have completed training over the most recent renewal funding
period and 95% of trainees who have completed the program in the past 15 years are employed in research
positions. A primary strength of the program is the innovative body of research among the MUSC NIMH T32
faculty, including a large number of federally-funded projects that address some of the most significant
questions facing the traumatic stress field and that closely align with NIMH Research Strategic Priorities."

The goal of the ENRICH (ENhancing Research In Cancer-related Health professions) Program is to immerse
trainees in the scientific process, foundational discovery, multidisciplinary translational frameworks, and the
breadth of opportunities for careers in cancer research, capitalizing on the environment and commitment from
the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) and the O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center (O’Neal). The
ENRICH Program capitalizes on the existing infrastructure of O’Neal and our cancer research community of
exceptional scientists leading paradigm-shifting translational, basic, clinical and public health research
enriched by partnerships with the O’Neal Cancer Training and Career Development Office, UAB Physician
Scientist Development Office, and UAB Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences Training Academy, to
establish an innovative 10-week summer Program for 30 medical, dental and master-level graduate students
from a diverse spectrum of disciplines including public health, basic science, health professions, nursing and
pharmacy from UAB and Samford University. The ENRICH Program is unique in that it will provide a
community of trainees each summer with a mentored, cancer research-focused experience (Aim 1)
complemented with a structured forum focused on transferrable skills including communication, personal and
professional development, rigor and reproducibility and research ethics. By including topics in cancer biology,
clinical research, epidemiology, outcomes, and implementation and dissemination science, we have the
opportunity to showcase the convergence of multidisciplinary translational science to the trainees (Aim 2). We
will evaluate the short-, intermediate- and long- term impact of the ENRICH Program by implementing a
comprehensive evaluation of the ENRICH Program (Aim 3). Through these efforts, ENRICH will prepare a
diverse and highly-skilled workforce to attain competence in inquiry-based cancer research, knowledge of the
state-of-the-art tools to apply to hypothesis-generation, and have a notable impact on the quantity and quality
of next generation of scientists and cancer care professionals – individuals that will knowledgeably and

10833520,"Project Summary/Abstract
This is the fourth renewal application of a structured intensive one-year training program in Biomedical Imaging
research based in the Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging at UCSF. The program is motivated by
an increasing shortage of clinician scientists who are critically needed to develop and translate innovative
imaging technologies to optimally diagnose and treat diseases. Over the last 17 years the “Biomedical Imaging
for Clinician Scientists (BICS)” program at UCSF has been highly successful in training leaders in Academic
Radiology, with the current department chair being one of the first group of T32 trainees. It should also be noted
that 77% of the T32 trainees are now faculty at academic institutions throughout the US, while only 18.5% of
UCSF radiology residents who did not complete the T32 training are at academic institutions. The T32 program
will be open to clinician scientists at the resident and fellow level interested in biomedical imaging research. The
primary long-term objective of this program is to train clinician scientists who will become leaders in Biomedical
Imaging. To achieve this, candidates with demonstrated potential in biomedical imaging research will be recruited
and mentored by a designated team of experienced researchers including clinician and basic scientists. Each
trainee will be affiliated with one of the existing research groups and clinical sections within the Department of
Radiology, and collaborate with researchers from both within and outside of the department in multidisciplinary
high impact research projects spanning the spectrum of biomedical imaging ranging from molecular imaging to
artificial intelligence. All T32 trainees will also undertake formal course training in research design and statistical
methods including scientific rigor and responsible conduct of research, as well as grant writing. The T32 program
integrates rigorous research training with robust mentorship to support the trainees in career development. Each
trainee is paired with a project specific research mentor as well as a career development mentor who together
help the trainee develop a career path for success in academic radiology. Given its unique resources, UCSF
Department of Radiology is ideally positioned to provide such a training program, supported by the large research
program and the high number of established researchers within the Department. The depth and diversity of the
clinical and research work within the Department of Radiology provides an optimal environment for the T32
trainees. The T32 trainees will be based within the new Life Sciences Mission Bay and China Basin campuses
of UCSF, which offer unique resources for collaborative research. These new resources will further increase the
ability of the Department to attract researchers and continue the long tradition of ground breaking, cutting edge
Biomedical Imaging Research. This training grant will not only strengthen biomedical imaging research at UCSF
but also increase the number of highly trained and qualified clinician scientists across the US."
10828851,"Arterial aging is characterized by diminished endothelium dependent dilation (EDD) and large artery stiffening.
The endothelium is a critical modulator of arterial function participating in the control of vascular tone, nitric
oxide production and bioavailability, large artery stiffening, inflammation, and barrier function. Deterioration of
the glycocalyx, a gel-like structure bound to the luminal surface of the endothelium, is accompanied by age-
associated vascular dysfunction by altering these functions of the vascular endothelium. Although the
glycocalyx is primarily known for its role in the microvasculature, it also impacts central cardiovascular
features, and deterioration or phenotypic changes in the glycocalyx with advancing age that likely impair larger
arterial function. The thickness of the glycocalyx decreases in the microvasculature of both mice and humans
with advancing age and this appears to be accompanied by alterations in its constituent molecules. Although
there is no consensus on whether the content of hyaluronan (HA), one of the primary glycosaminoglycan
components of the endothelial glycocalyx, decreases across the lifespan, there is evidence of a phenotypic
shift from high (HMW-HA) to low molecular weight. The importance of maintaining a youthful, HMW-HA, profile
is demonstrated by observations that HMW-HA has anti-aging, vasoprotective properties. Among the three HA
synthase (HAS) enzymes, HAS2 produces the majority of HMW-HA. However, although reductions in HAS2
gene expression have been reported in non-vascular tissues with aging, arterial data concerning the effects of
aging on HAS2 expression are limited. Thus, despite evidence suggesting that alterations in the glycocalyx; its
constituent, HA; and the enzyme responsible for its production, HAS2, are coincident with age-related arterial
dysfunction, their causal role remains elusive. Here, we will utilize endothelial specific, loss and gain of function
mouse models to elucidate the role of HAS2 and HA phenotype in alterations in the glycocalyx, arterial
function, inflammation, and permeability across the lifespan of mice. We will also interrogate the role of a HA
receptor, CD44, in these effects. Last, we will assess the efficacy of dietary supplementation with HMW-HA to
improve these aspects of arterial function in advancing age and explore underlying mechanisms. The results
will elucidate novel mechanisms of age-related vascular dysfunction as well as demonstrate proof-of-concept
for a new therapeutic to ameliorate age-associated arterial dysfunction that is easily translatable to humans."
10832618,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal describes a five-year career development plan designed to provide Scott Denstaedt, MD with
training in new techniques through mentored research and didactics to facilitate a career as an independent
physician-scientist studying mechanisms of long-term pulmonary complications in patients surviving sepsis.
Research plan: Despite modern supportive care, recovery from sepsis is associated with increased risk for
hospital readmission and death. Nearly one in ten patients with sepsis will be re-hospitalized within 90-days
with pulmonary conditions including pneumonia, aspiration pneumonitis, and/or respiratory failure. We do not
understand the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these complications and have no targeted
therapies to prevent them. Dr. Denstaedt has developed a mouse model in which survivors of sepsis have
enhanced (primed) immune responses to lung injury. Specifically, twenty-one days after sepsis there is
enhanced lung permeability and neutrophil recruitment following intranasal lipopolysaccharide. Dr. Denstaedt’s
prior work demonstrated that chronic brain dysfunction after sepsis is associated with innate immune priming
and persistent elevations of the danger signal protein S100A8/A9. The central hypothesis of this proposal is
that persistent S100A8/A9 signaling through TLR4 primes inflammatory monocytes predisposing to enhanced
lung injury. Aim 1 investigates how changes in inflammatory monocytes persisting in the lung after sepsis
predispose to enhanced alveolar damage after sterile or infectious lung injury. Immunostaining and fluorescent
microscopy with stereology, gene expression, and epigenetics assays will be performed to evaluate pathways
of inflammation and cell death. A causal link between primed monocytes and enhanced lung injury will be
examined in vivo by monocyte depletion and in vitro by monocyte/epithelial cell co-culture. In Aim 2,
S100A8/A9 inhibition and cell-specific TLR4 deletion will determine the effect of S100A8/A9-TLR4 signaling on
enhanced lung injury and priming after sepsis. Inflammatory phenotypes predisposing to injury will be
assessed by microscopy, gene expression, and epigenetics assays. The role of plasma S100A8/A9 from post-
sepsis patients in priming human monocytes will be examined by gene expression and epigenetics assays.
Applicant: Scott Denstaedt, MD has completed training in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine. He has
acquired extensive research experience in the last four years studying chronic brain dysfunction in a model of
long-term sepsis survival. The proposed training will provide new knowledge in lung injury and epigenetics to
examine the underlying mechanisms of post-sepsis pulmonary complications. Technical training includes
advanced microscopy and stereology, primary cell co-culture, state-of-the-art epigenetics assays, cell-specific
inducible knockout mouse modeling, and in vitro human translational studies. The training plan, mentorship
team, and mentored research will advance his career toward scientific independence, including a translational
R01 proposal focused on reversing mechanisms of long-term pulmonary complications in sepsis survival."
10830965,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
One of the promising strategies to treat retinal diseases is to generate desired neuronal types, which are
damaged or lost during disease, and develop cell replacement-based therapies. A comprehensive
understanding of how distinct retinal types are formed during development can greatly inform these therapeutic
strategies. While mitotic retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) are thought to be intrinsically different, the fates of
retinal cells are not determined in RPCs. Many newly born postmitotic cells are still plastic. It is currently not
clear how newly born postmitotic cells attain their final fate states. We propose to uncover the genes and
pathways that regulate fate decisions in newly born postmitotic cells during development and determine
whether they can also promote cell reprogramming in adult retina.
 We collected genes that are enriched in newly born postmitotic cells in the retina based on published
single cell RNA-seq data, and developed novel methods to study their function specifically in newly born
postmitotic cells in vivo by utilizing retroviral-based genetic approach and light sheet microscopy. A zinc finger
transcription factor Myt1 (Myelin transcription factor 1) was found to be enriched in newly born postmitotic cells,
but not RPCs, during development; it can promote neurogenesis, especially the formation of bipolar cells, while
repressing glial fate in newly born postmitotic cells at neonatal stages. We hypothesize that Myt1 ensures the
neuronal fates in newly born postmitotic cells and can contribute to neuronal reprogramming in mature retina.
In the proposed studies, we will test this hypothesis through two aims. In Aim1, we will elucidate the function of
Myt1 in fate determination, and test the hypothesis that Myt1 promotes bipolar cell fates by titrating down, but
not completely shutting down Notch signaling pathway, and by actively repressing glial genes in newly born
postmitotic cells. In Aim2, we will determine whether Myt1 together with Ascl1 and Brn2 can promote direct
reprogramming of Müller glial cells into neurons in mature mouse retina.
 Taken together, this proposal aims to elucidate the plasticity of postmitotic cells in mammalian retina. We
will focus on understanding how zinc finger transcription factor Myt1 promotes specific neuronal fates in newly
born postmitotic cells during development and determining whether Myt1 can enhance neuronal
reprogramming from glial cells in mature retina. This work will improve our understanding of basic biology and
provide new candidate genes and possibilities for the regeneration of retinal neurons. Notably, mutations in
human Myt1 gene are associated with Oculo-Auriculo-Vertebral Spectrum diseases, which are developmental
disorders with ocular defects such as microphthalmia. Elucidating the function of Myt1 in retinal development
can also shed light on the disease mechanisms."

CD8+ T cells are the main drivers of acute cellular rejection (ACR) of transplanted tissues. While T cells can
recognize alloantigens directly (through direct responses to allo-HLA) as well as indirectly (through allopeptides
bound to self-HLA), the major consensus is that direct recognition plays a major role in ACR. However, much is
unknown about the biology of T cells responsible for direct ACR. For decades, alloreactive T cells have been
viewed as either responding primarily to unique determinants on allo-HLA (HLA-centric responses), or to a
plethora of non-self peptides presented by allo-HLA (peptide-centric). Recent data though has suggested that
many alloreactive T cells are allospecific, responding to unique peptide/allo-MHC complexes present on the
surface of allografts. Moreover, additional data suggests that alloreactive T cells may share reactivities with
immunodominant viral epitopes and may in fact derive from pre-existing memory pools. While there is growing
clarity around the structural features and immunological origins of alloreactive T cells, the lack of knowledge
regarding the specificities of alloreactive T cells is a major reason for our limited biologic insight into T cell-
mediated ACR. We are now poised to make a substantial breakthrough in this area and capitalize on it to better
understand ACR and alloreactivity in general. In initial studies, using scRNA sequencing on biopsies and urine
from several patients undergoing kidney transplant rejection, we found a remarkably and unexpectedly small
number (~10-20/patient) of clonally expanded T cells with unique TCR CDR3 a/b sequences, and have
confirmed their specificity towards the transplanted tissue. These expanded T cell clones persist for months in
rejecting allografts, despite traditional anti-rejection therapy. The goal of this ambitious, high risk/high reward
project is to identify the ligands recognized by alloreactive T cells within transplant biopsies, including both
alloantigens and any cross-reactive viral epitopes and use this knowledge to begin decoding the immunobiology
of ACR, identify possible therapeutic targets, and expand our understanding of the nature and origins of
alloreactivity. Our specific hypotheses are that (i) the majority of clonally expanded allospecific TCRs recognize
unique tissue restricted peptides presented by allo-HLA; (ii) many of these TCRs are also cross-reactive with
viral epitopes presented by self-HLA; and (iii) identification of peptide targets will enable us to decode the
transcriptomes of allospecific T cells in kidney allografts. Success in this multi-PI R21 proposal will pave the way
for numerous, deeper, groundbreaking studies of alloreactivity, graft rejection, and novel therapeutic modulation
of ACR."
10834731,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ploidy altering mechanisms such as cell-cell fusion and whole genome doubling (WGD) can drive intratumoral
heterogeneity and alter chemotherapeutic response. Understanding the causes and consequences of these
mechanisms is especially important in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) which accounts for 15-20% of
diagnosed breast cancers and does not have targeted treatment options. Broad spectrum chemotherapies
remain the standard of care for TNBC, but their efficacy is dampened by high cellular heterogeneity and 40% of
treated TNBC patients will relapse. We hypothesize that ploidy altering mechanisms are a driving force behind
intratumoral heterogeneity and can function as active escape or damage recovery mechanisms to allow cells to
resist chemotherapy. An updated version of the ClonMapper barcoding system which includes nucleotide-
indexed expressed DNA barcodes on GFP and mCherry will be used to enable parallel tracking of cell-cell fusion
events in fluorescent live-cell imaging and determination of detailed transcriptomic and karyotypic clonal
trajectories in ploidy-separated longitudinal single-cell sequencing. The ClonMapper expressed DNA barcodes
will be added to TNBC cell lines and patient-derived cell cultures. In a series of controlled experiments we will
(1) determine the rates and distinguish the effects of pre-existing aneuploidy and therapy-induced aneuploidy in
clinically relevant TNBC models across different chemotherapeutic treatments, (2) follow subclonal
transcriptomic and karyotypic trajectories in scRNA-seq and scDNA-seq under normal and chemotherapeutic
conditions to determine if different chemotherapies select for or generate specific transcriptomic or karyotypic
patterns, and (3) elucidate the molecular factors which activate cell-cell fusion, WGD, or other ploidy altering
mechanisms. The results of these experiments will be rich in longitudinal single cell data on transcriptomic and
chromosomal transitions utilized by TNBC cells across chemotherapeutic perturbation and recovery. As the
degree of tumor aneuploidy can be easily determined from patient samples, we will experimentally parameterize
and validate an agent-based model which includes aneuploidy fraction, spontaneous and stress-induced
mechanisms of ploidy alteration, and genomic stability to predict tumor evolution under different therapeutic
schedules. This study will be the first to systematically investigate spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced
mechanisms of ploidy alteration in a longitudinal single-cell framework. In elucidating the cellular states which
predispose cancer cells for ploidy alteration, identifying the phenotypic and chromosomal transitions induced by
these events, and quantifying the effects of pre-existing and de novo generated aneuploidy on chemotherapeutic
resistance, the causes and consequences of cell-cell fusion and WGD may be revealed as primary contributors
to chemoresistance and inspire novel treatment strategies to improve TNBC patient outcomes."

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most commonly diagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder
of childhood and affects approximately 5-10% of children worldwide. ADHD is characterized by core symptoms
of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, though there is much heterogeneity in the ADHD phenotype. Much
research into the specific neural dysfunction underlying the pediatric ADHD phenotype has employed categorical
approaches, comparing children with ADHD to typically developing children. However, children with and without
clinical ADHD diagnoses experience a wide range of ADHD-related symptoms. As individuals with ADHD
symptom burden, regardless of diagnosis, are at risk for negative-long term outcomes, the proposed studies will
investigate the ADHD phenotype categorically and dimensionally to increase the understanding of the neural
substrates of ADHD symptom burden in clinical and nonclinical populations. As such, the proposed research will
use a novel dynamic functional connectivity method to determine whether task-based variations in functional
connectivity and behavior differ in children with ADHD and in children without ADHD (categorical approach;
Specific Aim 1), and whether there are relationships among ADHD symptom burden, functional connectivity
dynamics, and behavior in a large sample of children with continuous ADHD-related symptom measures
(dimensional approach; Specific Aim 2). Exploratory Aim 3 will further probe the heterogeneity in ADHD symptom
burden that exists within and across ADHD by using a community detection algorithm to identify subgroupings
of individuals with and without ADHD that exhibit similar symptom profiles. Together, the three aims of the
proposed research will contribute to the development of strategies that allow for the identification of individuals
who may benefit from treatment and intervention for ADHD symptom burden across diagnostic categories."

Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL, including clinically measurable audiometric threshold shifts) affects over 25
million adults, with the primary cause being exposure to occupational or other loud environmental sound.
However, many noise-exposed individuals report difficulty hearing in noisy environments without clinically
significant threshold increases. Animal model studies have revealed potential mechanisms of noise induced
hearing difficulties (NIHD) and their accompanying psychophysical and physiological changes, including a
candidate mechanism (with evidence from rodent models and emerging support from the macaque model) for
clinically normal hearing with difficulty in noisy environments: cochlear synapse loss. However, animal models
typically use single exposure protocols to create cochlear pathology, which are unlike the chronic noise
exposures leading to NIHL in humans, who experience smaller, repeated daily noise doses that result in NIHL.
Data from our macaque model of NIHL (having noise susceptibility similar to humans) suggests that the single
exposure noise levels needed to induce NIHL and cochlear synapse loss are much higher than sound levels
typically experienced by humans occupationally or recreationally. Nonetheless, preliminary data in macaques
show that single noise exposures that cause temporary threshold shifts (TTS) result in cochlear synapse loss 2-
months post exposure but not at 10-months post-exposure, and auditory processing deficits. This project will
expand these early observations to more realistic chronic noise exposures similar to those experienced by
workers. We propose psychophysical, physiological, and histological studies 1) to establish a timeline for the
development of sustained auditory processing deficits and cochlear pathology in macaques chronically exposed
to noise, and 2) to define behavioral and electrophysiological assays that detect changes in hearing that develop
prior to permanent threshold shifts (PTS). Our hypothesis is that chronic noise exposures (8 hours a day, 5 days
a week) cause a sequence of non-transient NIHD that progress to PTS. Specifically, we predict that chronic
noise exposures will cause psychophysical changes (Aim 1): the earliest deficits will be in spatial and temporal
processing, followed by deficits in processing signals in noise, followed by audiometric deficits (PTS).
Physiological changes (Aim 2) will parallel psychophysical changes: earliest deficits will be in middle ear muscle
reflex (MEMR) and measures of binaural and temporal processing, followed by deficits in distortion product
otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) amplitudes and masked auditory brainstem responses (ABR), followed by deficits
in DPOAEs and ABR thresholds. These deficits will be paralleled by cochlear pathology: early, non-transient
cochlear synapse loss, followed by outer hair cell loss, followed by a combination of outer and inner hair cell loss
(Aim 3). The results of these studies will reveal sensitive markers of early auditory damage with realistic noise
exposures, and the sequence of cochlear pathology. Study results will be used to develop reliable, clinically
viable early indicators of NIHL and enhance hearing loss prevention program outcomes."
10802325,"Project Summary: Even though Shigella and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are the two most
important bacterial causes of moderate-to-severe diarrhea in children in developing countries and in international
travelers, there are currently no licensed vaccines for these infections. The goal of this application is the
development of an injectable combination vaccine to protect from these two bacterial enteric infections.
 To accomplish this, we developed an ETEC vaccine candidate (MecVax) using the epitope- and structure-
based vaccinology platform, MEFA (Multi-Epitope Fusion Antigen) which results in a polyvalent fusion protein
with multiple epitopes on a single protein. MecVax includes two proteins, one to stimulate immunity to the
colonization factor antigens (CFAs) of ETEC and another to stimulate immunity to the two enterotoxins. The first
has epitopes for the seven most common CFAs while the second has epitopes for the heat-labile enterotoxin
(LT) and the heat stable enterotoxin (STa). Animals immunized with MecVax develop functional antibodies to
the CFAs and the two toxins and are protected when challenged with ETEC. Developing a safe and immunogenic
antigen for STa is innovative since this small protein (19AA) is not naturally immunogenic.
 To extend protection to shigellosis, we developed a MEFA for Shigella which includes epitopes for the different
virulence proteins that are common among all strains of Shigella and invasive E. coli. To further extend
protection, the Shigella MEFA also includes epitopes for shiga toxins (including shiga toxin producing E coli -
STEC). Because this vaccine is based on the virulence proteins which are common to all strains, this MEFA is
expected to protect against all Shigella species and serotypes and not be limited by serotype as are the other
vaccines which are based solely on the LPS antigen.
 There is no single animal model which can effectively evaluate the protective immune responses to the MEFA
vaccines; thus, we use a combination of assays to determine the immune responses to the MEFA vaccines.
Antibody responses in mice quantitate the responses to the specific epitopes in MEFA fusion while we use
functional antibody assays to determine if the antibodies block adhesion (for ETEC), invasion (for Shigella) and
neutralize toxins (for LT, STa and Shiga toxins). We then determine protection in animal models using a rabbit
colonization model (both ETEC and Shigella) and protection against disease in a pig model (for ETEC) and a
mouse lethal pulmonary challenge model (for Shigella). Using a combination of these assays and animal models,
we will build the preclinical evidence for the combined ETEC-Shigella combination vaccine.
 The central hypothesis is that unlike current oral vaccine candidates, an injectable Shigella-ETEC MEFA
vaccine will stimulate higher serum antibody titers and protect when the subject is most vulnerable and that
natural exposure will boost local intestinal immunity. An effective Shigella-ETEC vaccine will prevent hundreds
of millions diarrhea clinical cases and save > 200,000 lives annually."
10794319,"Project Summary
Natural killer (NK) cells are potent, effector lymphocytes with the ability to kill malignant and virally infected
cells by releasing lytic granules without the need for antigen specificity. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and
multiple myeloma (MM) are highly susceptible to NK cell-mediated killing. Strategies using donor NK cells to
treat these malignancies have yielded clinical responses in more than a third of patients, even allowing some
refractory AML patients to eventually get a curative bone marrow transplant. Despite these successes, NK cell
therapy has been limited by the short life span of infused cells and the occurrence of functional exhaustion that
occurs when NK cells are exposed to the tumor microenvironment. A subset of NK cells, termed ‘adaptive’
develops in response to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Adaptive NK cells live longer than conventional NK
cells, have a robust capacity to secrete cytokines, and are resistant to suppression in the tumor
microenvironment. We demonstrated that adaptive NK cell expansion after transplant is associated with a 26%
reduction in AML relapse and a 53% reduction in MM relapse. Our lab has developed a reliable method to
expand adaptive NK cells from peripheral blood of CMV seropositive donors; however, our preliminary data
also shows that chronic stimulation of adaptive NK cells through the activating receptor NKG2C, in combination
with inflammatory cytokines, induces high expression of checkpoint inhibitory receptors. We seek to
characterize the in vivo behavior of adaptive NK cells given as therapy for AML or MM. In Aim 1, we will
determine whether adaptive NK cells survive longer than conventional NK cells and traffic to the bone marrow
after allogeneic infusion. Patient samples will be collected from an ongoing phase I/II clinical trial using
allogeneic, adaptive NK cells to treat relapsed AML. In addition, we will test adaptive NK cell persistence and
longevity compared to conventional NK cell therapy in a murine model of MM. In Aim 2, we will identify
mechanisms of NK cell exhaustion and test whether checkpoint receptor blockade restores NK cell function.
These studies will be led by Dr. Aimee Merino, at the University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center, under
the mentorship of Dr. Jeffrey Miller. Dr. Merino is currently a postdoctoral fellow, but will become an instructor
upon completion of her fellowship training. Dr. Miller is a leader in NK cellular therapy with a track record of
translating discoveries in NK cell biology into novel clinical applications. The University of Minnesota Masonic
Cancer Center offers an exceptional environment for cultivating a career in translational cancer research. To
achieve the long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator, Dr. Merino has recruited an advisory
committee of leading scientists and developed a training plan aimed at broadening her knowledge base,
developing her technical expertise, and cultivating her leadership skills."

10906647,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. .
Kidney disease status is characterized by how efficiently the kidney is able to remove excess fluids and waste.
Podocytes within the glomerulus are integral to forming the barrier needed for this filtration. An estimated 15%
of adults in the US have chronic kidney disease (CKD), but there are no curative treatment options for CKD
and patients must resort to time-consuming dialysis or undergoing a kidney transplant to maintain a quality of
life during disease progression. The African American population of sub-Saharan descent has a 3.5-fold
increased risk for end-stage kidney disease compared to populations of European descent. This incidence
discrepancy is, in part, due to two pathogenic variants G1 and G2 in the apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene.
Individuals with the presence of one high-risk allele are resistant to African sleeping sickness, but the presence
of two high-risk alleles significantly predisposes to kidney disease.
As APOL1 is only found in humans and
some primates, this work utilizes isogenic human iPSC lines genetically engineered to contain APOL1 variant
genotypes. The mechanism of APOL1-mediated kidney diseases is not known but correlates with podocyte
population depletion. This depletion is thought to be linked to foot process effacement, a podocyte stress
response dictated by cytoskeletal rearrangements that cause the processes to simplify and flatten to flatten,
leading to decreased kidney function. This study proposes high-risk APOL1 podocytes are intrinsically different
compared to reference APOL1 podocytes. Variant APOL1 iPSC lines will be directly differentiated into pure
podocyte populations and will be used to determine if the presence of high-risk APOL1 interferes with podocyte
cytoskeleton dynamics. Further, this work will utilize a Design of Experiment (DoE) approach to detect the
effects of synergistic inputs involved in podocyte biology to determine if high-risk APOL1 podocytes are
intrinsically different. This research will assess human-specific aspects of podocyte biology in a representative
and homogenous cell population, providing an opportunity to gain an understanding of the mechanism of
APOL1-mediated diseases. Data generated will provide directly translatable and desperately needed
therapeutic intervention to kidney disease injury and progression."

This mentored Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award will provide the trainee, a PhD student in
epidemiology at UCSF, with the training necessary to become a researcher in sexual and reproductive health.
Her training goals for this fellowship are to gain expertise in health services research, bias analyses, and
methods to address missing data under the guidance of a team of expert mentors. This fellowship will provide
the applicant with the skills, content knowledge, and practical experience to launch an independent research
career focused on the evaluation of service delivery innovations in sexual and reproductive health.
Telehealth became a prominent method of sexual and reproductive health service delivery during the COVID-
19 pandemic. In telehealth services, patients are typically screened remotely, dispensed any medications by
mail, and followed subsequently to monitor for the occurrence of adverse events. Some research suggests that
telehealth patients may be less likely than those who receive in-person services to follow up with the telehealth
provider after medications are dispensed, and the outcomes of patients who do not complete follow-up are not
understood. The goal of this research is to evaluate the performance of telehealth protocols at identifying
adverse events. Building on the applicant’s prior work and current research position, this F-31 will involve
secondary analyses of data from a cohort study of patients who received telehealth sexual and reproductive
health services, to (Aim 1) estimate the incidence of adverse events among patients who do not return for
follow-up and (Aim 2) assess the timing and process of adverse events diagnoses after telehealth sexual and
reproductive health services. This evidence will allow telehealth sexual and reproductive health providers to
understand the risk of adverse events among their patients who do not return for follow-up and whether their
current follow-up protocols are optimal for the identification of adverse events. Knowledge gained from this
research will advance NICHD’s mission to ensure individuals are born healthy and wanted and that women are
not harmed by reproductive processes. The major strengths of this proposal are that it: (1) relies on a large
existing prospective dataset of US telehealth sexual and reproductive health patients, with which the applicant
already has experience; (2) uses rigorous methods for evaluating bias and addressing missing data; and (3)
tests clinically impactful hypotheses focusing on the timely and growing field of telehealth for sexual and
reproductive health. The proposed research and training will prepare the applicant for her future career as an
independent researcher focused on service delivery innovations in sexual and reproductive health care."
10802108,"ABSTRACT
A conserved long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) called Kcnq1ot1 is essential for proper mammalian development.
Defects in proper gene silencing by Kcnq1ot1 result in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, a birth defect with a
high mortality rate whose prevalence is increased in children conceived by in vitro fertilization. Despite its critical
role in development, the mechanisms that Kcnq1ot1 uses to silence genes remain poorly understood. While it is
known that Kcnq1ot1 silences genes by recruiting histone-modifying enzymes called the Polycomb Repressive
Complexes and G9a, it is not clear how sequence elements in Kcnq1ot1 facilitate these interactions. As one
possible clue, another repressive lncRNA that is essential for development, Xist, has been shown to interact with
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), that in turn, recruit the Polycomb silencing enzymes. In my own studies, I have
found that many of these same RBPs associate with Kcnq1ot1 at levels significantly higher than with other RNAs
in the transcriptome, implying that they too are important for the function of Kcnq1ot1. The objective of my study
is to further develop the mechanism of Kcnq1ot1 by identifying functional sequence domains in the transcript,
identify the RBPs that bind these regions, and determine their involvement in recruiting the Polycomb and G9a
silencing enzymes. If successful, I hope to not only elucidate the mechanism of Kcnq1ot1, which is conserved
in mice and humans, but further our general understanding of lncRNA function in early development. Long term,
this information could eventually contribute to optimization of in vitro fertilization and discovery of genes
implicated in infertility. The activities I propose will provide me with critical training in RNA biology and genomics,
molecular biology, developmental biology, teaching and mentorship, oral communication skills and networking,
and scientific writing, each of which will be critical for my future career as a principal investigator at a primarily
undergraduate institution."

Renewal of a five year program at Michigan State University (MSU) to Enhance Neuroscience Diversity through
Undergraduate Research Experience (ENDURE) is proposed. It is based on long-term, effective relationships
between MSU, and campuses in Puerto Rico (5), Northern New Mexico College, St. Mary’s University (San
Antonio, TX), and North Carolina Central, Raleigh). Each of these is a minority serving institution (MSI), and none
have significant research opportunities on campus. The Puerto Rican campuses serve populations distant from
the San Juan Metro area, and include University of Puerto Rico campuses in Cayey, Arecibo and Humacao as well
as private institutions (Universidad Ana G. Mendez and Pontifical Catholic University).During the last four years,
13 ENDURE students entered or were accepted (2020) into Ph.D. programs; an additional 6 are still in the
interview process. We achieve this result using a 3 step two yr program. 1) Students are introduced to
neuroscience, in a day-long workshop entitled, “What is Neuroscience?”and held annually on the partnering
campuses. Concepts of neurobiology are introduced, and integrated with simple hands-on experiments illustrating
testable hypotheses, and sheep brain dissection. 2) Ten students spend 10 weeks in an intensive summer
research program, working in labs of extramurally funded neuroscientists on hypothesis-directed projects. This is
preceded by a 2-day “bootcamp” introducing fundamentals of lab research, research integrity and instrument
methodology. 3) For seven students with special promise for graduate school, a 16 wk Fall Semester experience
at MSU is offered between their 3rd and 5th yrs. It includes coursework in neuroscience, further research on a
project with testable hypothesis, and professional development. Three courses are given. One introduces
fundamentals of neuroscience, one focuses on pharmacology of drug addiction, and the 3rd is a seminar-type
course stressing translational and inter-disciplinary approaches to understanding the etiology of human neurologic
and psychiatric disease. This course entails significant practice in writing, and an integral journal club.
Improvement of communication skills occurs both in summer and fall; they include both informal and more
formalized settings. included (research presentations, participation in class, journal club participation and paper
writing). Students from both the summer, and Fall Semester components will attend the annual meeting of the
Society for Neuroscience participating actively in the ENDURE Meeting affiliated with the Annual Meeting. Student
progress in both course work and research will be closely monitored and externally evaluated. An external advisory
committee comprising faculty from the collaborating institutions and URM faculty will provide input and guidance
regarding program direction and outcome and assist in candidate selection. An outstanding record of placement
of students into highly selective graduate programs occurred during the last award period. We plan to build on that
momentum in the next award."
10805494,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Because of the development of highly effective HER2-targeted therapies over the past two decades, most
patients now diagnosed with stage I-III HER2+ breast cancer (BC) are cured. These therapies have benefitted
patients who develop distant recurrence as well as the increasing proportion presenting with de novo HER2+
metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Indeed, a subset of these patients does exceptionally well, remaining on first-
line therapy indefinitely without evidence of disease progression. But, for these patients, the usual clinical
paradigm is non-curative. Though retrospective studies show some clinical predictors of durable response to
anti-HER2 treatments, there are currently no validated, predictive biomarkers. Though patients may have no
evidence of disease for years on systemic therapy, there currently is no standard approach for stopping therapy.
Tracking minimal residual disease (MRD) in the blood via cell-free DNA (cfDNA) may provide an important
approach to optimize treatment in patients with HER2+ MBC and will allow us to explore whether a subset of
such patients might be cured of breast cancer. Together with collaborators at the Broad Institute, we have
developed and tested an ultrasensitive blood test to detect MRD that involves tracking a large fingerprint of
patient-specific tumor mutations in cfDNA. We have applied this assay to patients with both early and advanced
BC, showing a strong relationship between an MRD positive test and disease recurrence or progression. We
plan to use this novel assay, in conjunction with a retrospective, cross-sectional study and a prospective clinical
trial, to define the role of MRD in HER2+ MBC.
Dr. Parsons is a medical oncologist specializing in breast cancer, seeking K08 support for mentored time with
Dr. Ian Krop at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, with Dr. Ben Park at Vanderbilt as a co-mentor. Her overarching
career goal is to improve outcomes for patients with breast cancer through the use of blood-based biomarkers.
She aims to become a clinical investigator who translates findings in the lab into meaningful diagnostics to
improve care of breast cancer patients. The proposed scientific aims, together with her training plan, will enable
her to acquire the knowledge, skills and approaches to help her to become a successful investigator. Here she
focuses on HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC) for its limited, but important scope, as an example of breast
cancer more broadly and the possibility of MRD assessment to help guide therapeutic intervention. She will apply
an approach developed to detect MRD to this setting, with the intention of expanding it to breast cancer more
broadly in the future."
10800656,"PROJECT SUMMARY 
Clostridioides difficile is a mucosal-associated pathogen that can cause life-threatening illness. The bacterium 
is a leading source of hospital-acquired GI infections, but is emerging in the healthy population. Asymptomatic 
colonization is common and only leads to productive infection in some individuals, and a subset of these 
patients will have a relapsing, more severe disease. C. difficile secretes toxin B (TcdB), an inactivator of small 
GTPases that induces epithelial cell death. This toxin helps C. difficile establish the niche it needs for 
productive infection. C. difficile requires perturbation in the microbiome to initiate disease. Although recent 
studies have revealed some means of how it overcomes commensals, we still do not fully understand how C. 
difficile establishes infection or initiates re-infection. Host immune responses likely play a role. Our long-term 
goal is to identify how cytokine biology may be therapeutically targeted to alleviate initial C. difficile infection or 
relapses in high-risk patients. Group 3 innate lymphocytes (ILC3s) are rare immune cells often found in 
mucosal tissues. They produce high levels of IL-22, a critical modulator of mucosal tissue responses. IL-22 is 
important for maintaining intestinal homeostasis in health and disease. Through maintenance of the epithelial 
barrier, the cytokine is protective in GI infections, although the role of IL-22 in C. difficile infection is not clear. 
In our studies investigating interactions between toxins and ILC3s, we examined the effects of TcdB on IL-22. 
Our preliminary data show that TcdB induces IL-22 in ILC3s in a GTPase-dependent manner. Pharmacological 
inhibition suggests that upregulation of IL-22 is through Cdc42. These data form the premise for our hypothesis 
that C. difficile modulates the host immune response. The overall objective for this application is to understand 
signaling pathway(s) through which TcdB may modulate ILC3 production of IL-22 and ascertain the benefits of 
elevated IL-22 to C. difficile during infection. In Aim 1 we will examine how the small GTPase Cdc42 may 
regulate IL-22 production in activated ILC3s. Through genetic or siRNA-mediated deletion of Cdc42 in ILC3s, 
we will examine if this small GTPase is a negative regulator of ILC3 activation as well as examine if there are 
links between Cdc42 and other signaling pathways, including STAT3 and MAPKs. In Aim 2, we will examine 
the interactions between C. difficile and TcdB, and IL-22 and the GI tissues. We will examine the function of IL- 
22 signaling in C. difficile infection using a reductionist approach with colonic organoids. Studies will examine if 
IL-22 protects against TcdB-mediated apoptosis and identify which IL-22-inducible factors contribute to altering 
the niche. An in vivo C. difficile infection model will complement in vitro experiments. This study may identify 
new signaling pathways involved in regulation of IL-22, which is of interest to both the infectious disease and 
chronic inflammation fields. We will also have a more complete understanding of how increased IL-22 levels 
modulate the inflammatory environment to favor C. difficile over other bacteria in the GI tract. This has 
implications on how IL-22 biology may be manipulated in preventing primary or relapsing C. difficile infection."

10835020,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Age is the largest single risk factor for the majority of diseases seen in clinics throughout the U.S. Demo-graphic
calculations predict that eliminating any single age-related disease would produce only a modest in-crease in
human health span (years of healthy life) or life span. However, postponing or decreasing the rate of aging
would retard the course of multiple age-related diseases and thus substantially increase health span and likely
life span. Our ability to develop rational approaches to preventing or intervening in the debilitating and costly
consequences of aging depends crucially on a thorough understanding of the causes of aging and how they
interact with the etiology of specific age-related diseases. Training young scientists to integrate research on
basic aging mechanisms with mechanisms of specific age-related diseases is a critical objective of this
application.
The long-term goal of this training program is to provide exceptional young scientists with the broad knowledge,
skills and interactions they will need to mitigate, through research, the enormous human and financial burdens
caused by aging and age-related diseases. This program will train postdoctoral fellows to become future leaders
in aging research. Each year, the program will train 10 talented postdoctoral scientists who will conduct research
for a 2-year period in one or more of 38 laboratories headed by outstanding preceptors at the Buck Institute for
Research on Aging, University of California, Berkeley and Stanford University. Trainees will participate in
research projects that include basic mechanisms of cellular stress responses, protein homeostasis, genomic and
epigenomic stability, stem cell maintenance, bio-energetics and energy metabolism and hormonal, growth factor
and nutrient signaling pathways. They will utilize a variety of model systems including yeast, round and flat
worms, fruit flies, fish, mice and human cells and tissues. And they will focus on an array of age-related diseases
including Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases, stroke, cardiac and vascular dysfunction, cancer,
diabetes, osteoporosis and sarcopenia. Trainees will be instructed in state-of-the-art techniques in genomics,
epigenomics, drug screening, proteomics and metabolomics, as well as genetics, biochemistry, structural
biology, cell biology, and cell and organismal imaging. They will receive the benefits of diverse seminar series
and other scientific events and frequent net- working opportunities. They will also attend courses in specialized
scientific topics, as well as courses or discussion groups on geriatric medicine, ethics, presentation skills,
proposal and manuscript writing, and laboratory management skills. The program will fill an important national
and international need for high-quality advanced training that integrates basic aging research with research on
age-related disease."

This program will renew the NEI T32 Stanford Vision Training Program. Based on excellence in postdoctoral
training among our vision science faculty, our goal is to provide a vision-specific research training program
with integrated clinical experience to the talented trainees aiming for careers as vision scientists and
clinician-scientists. Specifically, we seek training support for 4 postdoctoral fellow slots per budget year for
the next five years. The 38 primary vision research faculty in the Stanford Vision Training Program includes
21 PhDs, 4 MDs, and 13 MD/PhDs of all academic ranks, with strengths in diverse areas, including
molecular and cellular vision biology, vision encoding and circuitry, development and genetics, in vivo
imaging, higher order visual behavior and perception, mechanisms of diseases, and different approaches
to the treatment of diseases. Together, the core vision faculty is currently funded by 140 grants totaling over
$36M annually, of which 38 grants are from the NEI, 60 grants are from the NIH (including NEI), and the rest are
from the Department of Defense, National Science Foundation, and various foundations. These are
supplements with strong institutional support and commitment. Following the success from our first program
cycle, developments to strengthen the next cycle of the Stanford Vision Training Program include
leveraging the Stanford Ophthalmology Advanced Research Residency Program and enhancing our Executive
Committee, External Advisory Committee, and Trainee Mentoring Committees. Efforts will continue towards
the recruitment of a highly skilled cohort of vision research faculty to Stanford; unparalleled institutional
resources committed by the department and by the Stanford University School of Medicine; formal
classroom, clinical and laboratory training under the auspices of carefully crafted training plans; and ongoing
semi-monthly and annual vision research symposia. Together with a consistently large, productive and diverse
applicant pool, these will allow the Stanford Vision Training Program to produce future leaders in eye and
vision research who are able to tackle the most interesting and important questions and open new horizons
at Stanford and beyond."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Lipid regulation of cellular signaling and protein-protein interactions
Cellular proteins accomplish their functions through interactions with other proteins, forming complex
protein-protein interaction networks. Cellular protein-protein interaction typically involves small
modular protein interaction domains, such as Src-homology 2 and PSD95, Dlg1, ZO-1 domains.
Physiological significance of protein interaction domain-mediated protein-protein interaction networks
has been well supported by a large number of protein interaction domains encoded by human
genome and many human diseases, including cancer, caused by dysfunctional protein interaction
domain-mediated cellular processes. Interestingly, most protein interaction domains have moderate
binding affinity and a significant degree of promiscuity. This may be necessary for reversibility and
redundancy of cell signaling pathways but raises a fundamental question as to how high-fidelity
cellular function and regulation can be achieved through the protein interaction domain-mediated
protein-protein interaction. We have recently shown that membrane lipids, including cholesterol and
phosphoinositides, coordinate and regulate protein-protein interaction by directly and specifically
interacting with protein interaction domains. This important new discovery and our innovative in situ
quantitative lipid imaging technology provide us with a unique and unparalleled opportunity to
elucidate the mechanisms by which lipids orchestrate spatiotemporal specificity of protein-protein
interaction and cell signaling and develop new strategies to modulate these processes. Given the
importance of protein interaction domain-mediated protein-protein interaction and cell signaling in
health and disease, our proposed research should have a major impact on broad areas of biology and
medicine and lay the foundation for a pioneering and innovative drug discovery strategy for human
diseases, most notably cancer."
10849860,"Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have greater prevalence of alcohol use disorders (AUDs),
with this comorbidity associated with worse illness outcomes, yet there remains limited mechanistic
understanding of how PTSD confers risk for AUD. Understanding risk factors that associate with and predict the
development of AUDs in PTSD could inform interventions and prevention efforts to reduce the rate of this
comorbidity and improve outcomes of both disorders. Identifying predictors of risk requires longitudinal studies
in PTSD aimed at capturing the mechanisms leading to the emergence of AUDs. There is growing evidence
PTSD is related to biased decision-making during approach-avoidance conflict. Alcohol is also suggested to alter
approach-avoidance decision-making. AUDs and acute alcohol intoxication is associated with a bias to seek out
reward despite the possibility of threat (e.g., contributing to relapse following alcohol cue exposure and risky
behavior during intoxication respectively). Alcohol-induced changes in approach-avoidance decision-making
have not been investigated in the context of PTSD, but emerging data support our hypothesis that an interaction
between alcohol and approach-avoidance conflict in PTSD may occur and contribute to risk for alcohol misuse
and development of alcohol problems. No current data, cross-sectional or longitudinal, have tested the role of
alcohol-induced changes in approach-avoidance conflict as a mechanism of risk for AUD among individuals with
PTSD. To address this gap, we propose to leverage our group's expertise in placebo-controlled alcohol
administration procedures, longitudinal modeling, functional neuroimaging, and computational neuroscience
approaches to investigate the effects of acute alcohol on approach-avoidance decision-making and mediating
changes in multivariate neurocircuitry patterns in limbic, striatal, and salience networks. The proposed study will
test our conceptual model positing that acute alcohol alters the relative bias in computational mechanisms for
threat vs reward, thereby decreasing avoidance to threat and increasing approach to reward in adults with PTSD,
and through this mechanism increases risk for heavier alcohol use over time. Research aims are to identify
alcohol-induced changes in approach-avoidance decision-making and mediating neural networks that predict
alcohol use and symptoms of AUDs over a one-year follow-up period in adults with PTSD, compared to adults
with interpersonal violence exposure but no PTSD and healthy comparison adults. Essential to successfully
improving clinical prognosis in PTSD are research results that enable better prediction, diagnosis, and treatment
based on the individual. There is a paucity of human clinical research investigating interactions between acute
alcohol exposure and PTSD that may drive risk for development of AUDs following trauma. Data could identify
brain and behavioral mechanisms explaining how alcohol alters an important domain of PTSD contributing to
risk for alcohol misuse and development of alcohol problems. Results could pave way for development of novel
behavioral and pharmacological methods to treat PTSD and decrease risk for developing comorbid AUDs."
10917051,"Abstract
Monitoring intracranial pressure (ICP) is the global standard of care following severe brain injury. The goal of
monitoring and treating rises in ICP is to maintain adequate cerebral blood flow (CBF), thereby preventing
secondary brain injury. ICP is measured by a small pressure-sensitive probe inserted through the skull, with risk
of intracranial hemorrhage and infection, hence used only in the most critically ill patients. More importantly, ICP
probes do not directly measure CBF and critical closing pressure (CrCP), the pressure where blood flow ceases,
which is needed to correctly assess cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). Therefore it is not currently possible to
separate benign ICP elevations from flow-limiting pressure spikes. A non-invasive monitor of ICP, CBF and CrCP
would enable targeted interventions that directly optimize cerebral perfusion and significantly expand the
potential use cases for ICP monitoring. Diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) has emerged as a viable tool to
monitor CBF, CrCP and ICP. To measure CBF, DCS quantify the timescale of fluctuations in the intensity of
coherent, diffusely propagating near-infrared light, which are driven by the motion of red blood cells. DCS
measures ICP based on the morphology of the pulsatile blood flow (pCBFi) and it estimates CrCP by means of
a linear regression approach between pulsatile blood pressure and pCBFi. While successful proof of concept
studies have been conducted by our group and others, the clinical translation of DCS in adults is currently
hampered by the challenge of balancing the requirement for high brain sensitivity, which requires large source-
detector separations, and the need for high signal to noise ratio (SNR) at high acquisition rates to capture detailed
pulsatile blood flow data. Current DCS devices operate at 785 - 850 nm and are limited to separations of 2.5 cm,
offering relatively low brain sensitivity, high risk of superficial physiology contamination, and requiring pulse-
gated averages of 50-60 cardiac cycles to extract clean pCBFi signals due to limited SNR. Quantification of CBF
is strongly affected by scalp blood flow and important morphological information needed to accurately quantify
CrCP and ICP is lost during the averaging. To overcome these limitations, we propose to partner with one of the
pioneers of superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPD) technology, Quantum Opus, to develop
a compact, low sonic and thermal emission 8 channel SNSPD unit, designed with costs, manufacturability and
scalability in mind, that we will integrate with a state-of-the art 1064 nm laser system, heterodyne detection, and
fast FPGA correlator to offer bilateral DCS monitoring at 3.5 cm (>50% increase in brain sensitivity) with more
than 200-fold increase in SNR with respect to current 785 - 850 nm DCS technology. We will demonstrate the
feasibility and initial clinical utility of the SNSPD-DCS in 50 neuro-ICU patients and validate our CBF, CrCP and
ICP estimates against TCD, invasive ICP, Hemedex, and patient outcomes. The successful realization of this
state-of-the-art non-invasive cerebral perfusion and pressure monitor will enable guided management of patients
resulting in improved neurological outcomes."
10844486,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Science is failing minorities in the US by 1) not facilitating adequate pipelines for the professional
development of minority scientists and 2) not focusing adequate research on the disparities affecting minority
populations. This proposed institutional training grant (T32) targets this gap by providing robust research
training on HIV and mental health disparities that impact racial/ethnic minorities and establishing a pipeline to
support underrepresented Black and Latinx trainee scientists. Preparing trainees with the scientific tools to
become experts in the complex interplay of socio-structural and individual mental health variables perpetuating
disparities in HIV outcomes is crucial to ending the HIV epidemic. HIV continues to disproportionally impact
Black and Latinx communities in the US; and Miami remains the epicenter of HIV with most new HIV
diagnoses annually. Miami’s racial/ethnic, cultural, and sexual/gender diversity, its HIV-related health and
mental health disparities, and the training infrastructure and faculty expertise at the University of Miami (UM),
make Miami an ideal location for this HIV mental health research training program.
 The proposed T32 is closely tied to the aims of the UM Center for HIV and Research in Mental Health
(CHARM, an NIMH-funded Developmental AIDS Research Center; D-ARC). It will train two underrepresented
pre-doctoral students in psychology and public health sciences and up to 4 post-doctoral fellows across
disciplines over 5 years in two linked areas: 1) culturally informed interventions for racial/ethnic, sexual, and
gender minority populations and 2) innovative bio-behavioral interventions including scale up, linkage, and
dissemination/implementation programs for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and treatment as prevention
(TasP) in populations who need it most. Training will emphasize 1) innovative state-of the science statistical
and design methods, 2) community engagement through participatory research, and 3) professional
development, mentorship, and network building congruent with the needs of racial/ethnic trainees focused on
minority populations - all to ensure long-term success of program graduates. These focal areas are closely
aligned with NIH/DAIDS goals, CHARM expertise, UM public health and psychology faculty, and UM’s
roadmap for racial justice. Innovations include a focus on immersive community engagement and community-
based participatory research projects, integrated with coursework and training in key behavioral science topics
such as socio-structural, bio-behavioral and epidemiological foundations of HIV/mental health research.
Weekly seminars will provide professional development in rigor and reproducibility, innovative methods,
community-engaged research and immersion in the HIV and mental health fields, building professional
networks, capitalizing on UM’s faculty mentoring expertise, and providing linkages with the CHARM
Community Advisory Board. T32 fellows will graduate with the expertise and capacity to achieve their
professional goals and skills to conduct research to reduce HIV disparities in Black and Latinx communities."
10820466,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is globally the most common and serious viral infection of the liver,
causing premature deaths from liver diseases or liver cancer. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection and
liver cancer caused by HBV among Asian Americans is one of the most serious—but frequently
neglected—health disparity issues in the U.S. Hepatocarcinogenesis from HBV infection to
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development has been increasingly recognized as a multifactorial,
multi-level and multi-step process. Less is known about the multiple factors and the underlying
mechanisms responsible for chronic liver disease progression in high risk Asian Americans. Evolving
models of liver disease posit a strong role for virus, chronic inflammation and oxidative DNA damage.
Co-factors that may influence these disease processes include exogenous and endogenous factors.
The application of a multi-level framework, however, is relatively new in the study of chronic liver
disease progression (e.g., CHB phenotype, liver disease severity) among CHB patients. Moreover,
there is great variance in the hepatic disease progress among CHB patients, and the psychosocial
factors contributing to or responsible for biological system impairment have not been identified. The
goal of this study is to longitudinally examine the multiple pathways to disparities in chronic liver
disease progression using two unique clinic-based patient cohorts of CHB Korean Americans receiving
care from Korean-American hepatologists. We will recruit and enroll 600 Korean American CHB
patients. Medical chart review, structured patient interviews, biomarkers, qualitative, and geo-spatially
referenced data will be integrated to explore multi-level models of liver disease progression over a 10-
year clinical window, within a group at high risk for adverse outcomes. The specific aims are: (1) to
estimate the prevalence of CHB phenotypes and liver disease severity, and associated covariates at
the initial visit; (2) identify how multiple factors (e.g., social environmental, psychosocial, behavioral,
clinical and biological attributes) are associated with variation in liver disease progression; (3) to
examine the moderating and mediating effects of these factors on the relationship between CHB
phenotypes and adverse liver disease outcomes (e.g., HCC); and (4) to understand care-seeking
behaviors and dynamics of care within an ethnically concordant liver disease care model using an
explanatory mixed methods approach. Finally, comparison to clinical data from large CHB cohorts in
US and Korea will strengthen generalizability. Insights gained from this proposed study will provide the
groundwork to understand the multi-level and multi-step process of chronic liver disease and liver
cancer among high risk population with CHB patients, and develop potential interventions at multiple
levels (policy, social-behavioral and clinical) to reduce disparities in liver disease progression."
10820463,"RNA decay. The balance between RNA transcription and degradation contributes to regulation of RNA
lifetime, quality and abundance. Two principle RNA decay pathways exist in eukaryotes, one degrades RNA 5’
to 3’ while the other degrades RNA 3’ to 5’. The 3’ to 5’ decay pathway requires activities of the RNA exosome,
a multi-subunit protein complex that contains a nine-subunit non-catalytic core and two additional subunits that
catalyze processive and distributive 3’ to 5’ RNA exoribonuclease activities. Ten of the eleven genes are
essential for life in budding yeast, suggesting the importance of the RNA exosome and its activities in cellular
function. In addition, reports over the last several years suggest that humans harboring mutations in select
components of the 3’ to 5’ decay pathway suffer from diseases ranging from motor neuronopathies to cancer.
Fundamental aspects of eukaryotic exosome structure and function have been illuminated; however, many
questions remain with respect to how upstream factors target substrates for degradation. As RNA decay
pathways play a fundamental role in eukaryotic nucleic acid metabolism and disease, our studies are directly
relevant to human health and the NIH mission as misregulation of RNA decay is associated with cancer,
inflammation and neurodegeneration. This renewal will address central issues of RNA exosome biology by
reconstituting or purifying RNA exosomes and upstream factors for characterization through biochemical,
genetic and structural studies to establish functions for 3’ to 5’ decay in vitro and in vivo.
Ubiquitin-like proteins. Signal transduction can rely on reversible chemical modifications to relay information.
Protein substrates can be covalently modified by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins such as SUMO (small
ubiquitin-like modifier) to regulate processes such as nuclear transport, cytokinesis, chromosome segregation,
G2-M cell cycle progression and transcription. Post-translational modification by ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-
like (Ubl) proteins requires the sequential action of E1 activating enzymes, E2 conjugating enzymes and E3
protein ligases while Ub/Ubl processing and deconjugation is catalyzed by Ub/Ubl-specific proteases. Ubiquitin
and SUMO conjugation play integral roles in eukaryotic nuclear metabolism and cell cycle control and our
studies are of direct relevance to human health, cancer, and the mission of the NIH. This renewal seeks to
address the functional significance for components of the ubiquitin and SUMO conjugation pathways through
structural, biochemical and genetic studies that will establish a basis for Ub/Ubl activation, conjugation by E2
and E3 enzymes, and signaling through characterization receptors that recognize Ub/Ubl-conjugated
substrates. The enzymes, mechanisms and cofactors utilized for ubiquitin and SUMO protein conjugation
pathways are conserved so our studies are broadly relevant to other Ub/Ubl-related pathways."

This is an initial submission of a K23 application by Dr. Alison Potok, under the mentorship of Dr. Dena Rifkin,
at the University of California San Diego (UCSD). This proposal will establish Dr. Potok as an independent
investigator, and will evaluate the clinical applications of the difference in estimated glomerular filtration rate by
cystatin C (eGFRCys) vs. creatinine (eGFRCr), for prognosis in the long-term and drug dosing in the short-term.
Candidate: Dr. Potok’s training objectives and career goals through this proposal include: 1) to become an
expert in geriatric nephrology and proficient in pharmacology and drug dosing in the elderly; 2) to develop skills
in advanced statistical methods, epidemiology, manuscript and grant writing; 3) to learn the necessary skills to
design and conduct a clinical study and develop a research team. She has assembled a multidisciplinary
mentorship team comprised of a primary mentor, Dr. Rifkin, an established leader in geriatric nephrology, and
the following additional co-mentors and collaborators: Dr. Ix, an expert in nephrology clinical trials; Dr. Moore,
an authority in geriatric medicine and aging research, Dr. Gutierrez, an expert in kidney disease with extensive
experience and insight to the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study
utilized for Aim 2; Dr. Katz, the Director of Biostatistics at the University of Washington, who has worked
extensively with Drs. Rifkin, Ix, and Potok; Dr. Hallan, Professor of Medicine with expertise in decision curve
analysis and extensive experience in the Norwegian Nord-Trondelag Health Study (HUNT) utilized for Aim 1.
Research: Most patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) will not progress to end stage kidney disease
(ESKD) due to the competing risk of death. Frailty may increase the risk of death vs. the risk of ESKD. The
current kidney failure risk equation (KFRE) and mortality risk equation in kidney disease (MREK) do not
account for frailty. In preliminary work, Dr. Potok has showed that the difference in eGFR by cystatin C vs.
creatinine (eGFRDiff defined as eGFRCys – eGFRCr) is associated with risk of incident frailty and death.
Moreover, Dr. Potok’s preliminary results show heterogeneity across the spectrum of eGFRDiff regarding
which marker between cystatin C vs. creatinine is the best surrogate for true kidney function. The overall
hypothesis is that eGFRDiff can be used to guide clinicians on whether to start preparing patients for renal
replacement therapy and with medication dosing. In Aim 1, she will determine whether the inclusion of
eGFRDiff, as a marker of frailty within the KFRE and MREK will improve assessment of the competing risk of
ESKD vs. death in older adults. This Aim will be conducted in participants aged >65years with CKD of the
HUNT study, an exclusively White European population. In Aim 2, she will explore the competing risk of ESKD
vs. death in a biracial American population in REGARDS. In Aim 3, Dr. Potok will examine whether eGFRDiff
could be used to determine those in whom eGFRCr should not be trusted for drug dosing, and eGFRCys should
be used instead, with vancomycin as the prototype medication."
10794263,"Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Prospective Community Study. Dementia is a
leading cause of disability and death in older adults. Its incidence increases exponentially with
age. Identifying independent risk factors and valid disease markers are critical steps towards
prevention, improved diagnosis, and treatment. To enhance clinical and public health care,
these factors must be identified in population settings. We seek to extend, for a further five
years, a 15-year prospective population-based study of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
dementia in a low SES-area of southwestern Pennsylvania. The original richly characterized
cohort is now aged 80+, and at maximum risk for dementia; we have replenished the cohort by
recruiting additional participants currently aged 65-74, for a total current sample ~1100.
 Our objective remains to identify, at the population level, risk factors for clinically
relevant adverse cognitive outcomes of MCI, cognitive decline, and progression to dementia.
We propose a new set of specific aims investigating novel disease markers in relation to these
outcomes. Our new high performing mass-spectrometry-based plasma β amyloid (Aβ) assay
holds potential for affordable non-invasive screening for Alzheimer's disease. 7T MRI brain
scans will allow in-depth imaging of cerebrovascular integrity in a subgroup and help
understand the role of small vessel disease (SVD) in cognitive decline and dementia. Non-
invasive wrist actigraphy will measure sleep-wake rhythms which we will examine in relation to
the cognitive outcomes, Aβ and SVD. GWAS and transcriptomics will allow us to examine
genome-wide genetic and gene expression data. We will assess the relationships of these three
biomarkers (Aβ, SVD, sleep), along with genomics and gene expression, and their mutual
interactions, to the clinically relevant outcomes of cognitive decline and dementia.
 New light shed on mechanisms underlying these disorders, using modeling techniques to
account for biases and generalize results from sub-samples back to the entire cohort, will lead to
new insights to help reduce the public health burden of dementia."
10828333,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cognitive impairment is a common non-motor symptom among individuals living with Parkinson’s disease (PD).
Traditionally, cognitive impairment is thought to reflect disruptions in dopaminergic frontal-striatal systems.
However, the current conceptualization does not thoroughly explain the heterogeneous profiles or trajectories of
cognitive impairment in PD; suggesting that alternative mechanisms may contribute to cognitive impairments.
Identification of alternative mechanisms of cognitive impairment may lead to better prognostic prediction and
yield novel treatment targets.
The gut is implicated as a site of early pathology in PD. Early signs of PD pathology (alpha synuclein and Lewy
body aggregates) are detected in the gastrointestinal tract years before motor symptoms manifest. Recent
studies provide evidence that individuals with PD have an altered gut-bacterial composition (termed dysbiosis)
relative to controls. To date, dysbiosis is linked to more severe motor symptoms and certain non-motor symptoms
(constipation, REM behavioral sleep disorder) in PD, but the relationship between dysbiosis and cognitive
impairment remains unknown.
Animal studies support the hypothesis that microbiota composition play a direct role in cognitive impairment.
Germ free (GF) mice demonstrate deficits in cognition. Specifically, findings suggest that a disrupted gut-
microbial environment in conjunction with elevated stress hormones may create an imbalance of pro-
inflammatory vs. anti-inflammatory cytokines that induces potentially reversible cognitive impairments. In human
studies among individuals with PD, neuroinflammatory markers are associated with cognitive impairment.
However, the relationship between dysbiosis, neural inflammation and cognitive functioning remains unknown.
This model has incredible clinical implications, as microbiota dysbiosis may represent a reversible risk factor for
cognitive impairment.
The proposed study will examine the hypothesis that dysbiosis contributes to increased neuroinflammation and
cognitive impairment. Microbiota composition/function, neuroinflammatory markers and cognitive functioning will
be examined in 100 participants with PD. Analyses of microbiota composition/function will examine abundance
of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs; 16s), bacterial species/strains (metagenomics), microbial genes, and
functional pathways. We hypothesize that microbiota composition/function will be associated with inflammatory
markers (e.g. interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, c-reactive protein) and cognitive impairment."
10754969,"PROJECT SUMMARY (DESCRIPTION)
Circadian rhythms coordinate behavior and physiology with predictable daily environmental cycles. The timing
of circadian cycles is primarily determined by the timing of light exposure. Chronic disruption of circadian
rhythms, such as that experienced during shift work or travel across time zones, increases the risk of several
types of cancer in people. A handful of studies has shown that exposure to altered light cycles designed to
recapitulate so-called “chronic jet lag” experienced by shift workers enhances tumorigenesis in genetically
engineered mouse models of breast, liver, and lung cancers. We have established that exposure to a lighting
schedule that mimics chronic jet lag increases tumor formation in a mouse model of KRAS-driven lung
adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, we found that tumors from mice exposed to chronic circadian disruption
express higher levels of genes that are activated by the heat stress response factor, HSF1.
HSF1 has been shown to facilitate tumorigenesis in several systems, and may be particularly pathogenic in
RAS-driven cancers. We hypothesize that chronic circadian disruption causes elevated activity of HSF1, thus
leading to aggravated oncogenic activity of KRASG12D, and increased tumorigenesis. This proposal will
examine whether HSF1 is required for increased formation of KRASG12D-driven lung tumors in response to
circadian disruption.
In Aim 1 of this project, we will use genetic deletion of Hsf1 either throughout the animal or exclusively within
tumors to investigate its role in increased tumorigenesis caused by circadian disruption in KrasLSLG12D mice
(a.k.a. Krastm4TyJ). In Aim 2 of this project, we will use a combination of bulk RNA sequencing, digital cytometry,
detection of differential rhythmicity, and location-barcoded sequencing of tumor-bearing lung sections to reveal
additional molecular mechanisms that could contribute to enhanced tumorigenesis in response to
environmental disruption of circadian rhythms."
10906646,"Abstract: Substance use disorder (SUD) is a complex emotional and motivational disorder with no effective
treatment thus far. Currently, the United States is in the midst of a SUD epidemic that defies socioeconomic
and generational boundaries. A particularly insidious component of SUD is relapse, which is the strong
motivational drive to seek drugs during abstinence. Cue-induced drug seeking is a rodent model of relapse,
wherein a drug-associated cue is presented in the absence of the drug to trigger quantifiable seeking behavior.
Addiction research attributes drug-seeking behaviors, such as cue-induced drug-seeking following self-
administration (SA) of cocaine, to altered function of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Focusing on the NAc,
extensive studies have examined drug-induced adaptations in GABAergic, medium-spiny neurons (MSNs),
which are the majority cell type (~90%) and principal functional output of the NAc. In contrast, much less is
known about how glial cells, such as astrocytes, shape drug-related behaviors. Astrocytes closely associate
with synapses, allowing them to directly monitor and regulate synaptic transmission. The astrocyte-synapse
association (referred to as the tripartite synapse) plays a key role in experience-dependent synaptic
adaptations associated with learning and memory. Thus, the objective of this application is to characterize how
astrocytes regulate synaptic dynamics in the NAc Shell (NAcSh), which, in turn, regulate cue-induced cocaine
seeking in the mouse SA model. Prior results show that re-exposure to cocaine-associated cues re-silences
cocaine-generated NAcSh synapses, a process which contributes to the destabilization of cue-associated
cocaine memories upon cue re-exposure-induced memory retrieval. Preliminary results demonstrate that
functional astrocyte activity during withdrawal (WD) is necessary for the cue-induced re-silencing of cocaine-
generated synapses in the NAcSh, and that cues associated with cocaine reward increase astrocyte activity in
the NacSh. These preliminary results link astrocyte activity to the dynamic state of cocaine-generated silent
synapses and lead to my hypothesis that astrocytes regulate the cue-induced synaptic adaptations of cocaine-
generated synapses in the NAcSh which, in turn, regulate cue-induced cocaine seeking after cocaine WD. I will
test this hypothesis by pursuing two aims. Aim 1 will test the sufficiency of increased astrocyte activity to re-
silence cocaine-generated NAcSh synapses during WD. Aim 2 will expand preliminary data, which
demonstrates the necessity of functional astrocyte activity during WD for cue-induced synaptic re-silencing, by
using pharmacological and viral tools with increased temporal precision to suppress astrocyte activity
immediately prior to cue re-exposure. The expected outcome will provide a holistic understanding of how the
NAcSh regulates drug-induced behaviors by incorporating astroglia, thus revealing NAcSh astroglia as key
cellular substrates targeted by drug experience to reshape behaviors. This potential conceptual expansion may
provide novel angles to understand the cellular and circuit mechanisms underlying drug seeking and relapse."
10800679,"Project Summary
Learning and performing complex skills such as speech or music requires precise control of motor variability.
While elevated motor variability can spur the learning of new behaviors, excessive variability can impair
performance of learned skills. How the brain controls motor variability during learning and in expert
performance remains unclear. Intriguingly, the basal ganglia (BG) is an important source of motor variability in
both health and disease, and is a key site where dopamine (DA) reinforces more successful behaviors. Indeed,
the BG’s ability to regulate motor variability is especially critical for complex sequential skills such as speech,
where variability can arise at both the level of elementary motor “syllables” and the sequential “syntax” in which
these syllables are organized. How DA signaling in the BG influences motor variability during the learning of
complex sequential skills akin to speech or music is poorly understood. Moreover, rather than acting alone, an
emerging view is that DA signaling is strongly modulated by other signaling molecules, such as adenosine
(Ado), which may track the metabolic costs associated with extensive motor practice. Here I will characterize
how Ado and DA release in the BG are related to each other, to motor variability, and to the learning of
vocal motor sequences. In direct service of BRAIN initiative goals, I will combine cutting-edge computational
and optical tools along with an innovative molecular-genetic approach to dissect both neuromodulator and cell-
type specific contributions to motor variability and learning. My Specific Aims are: 1) To image Ado and DA in
the sBG during juvenile vocal learning. 2) To establish the necessity of sBG Ado to regulate variability and test
for a direct link between Ado and DA release. 3) To genetically tag “indirect” and “direct” spiny neuron types
and assess how Ado modulates their activity to influence song variability. Individually, each aim will move
beyond a single-neuromodulator model of BG skill learning, and collectively they will help reveal fundamental
mechanisms that control motor variability across learning and performance. I will conduct this research under
the supervision of Drs. Richard Mooney, Josh Huang, and John Pearson, an interdisciplinary team of

Breast cancer is a widespread disease that will claim the lives of over 40,000 US women in 2022 alone, with the
majority of these deaths resulting from stage IV disease, in which cancer has metastasized to distant regions,
as metastatic disease is difficult to treat and has few effective treatment options. Breast cancer cells metastasize
by invading the basement membrane, invading into blood vessels, circulating to distant tissues, leaving the blood
vessel, and colonizing that tissue. The epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) plays a role in cell adhesion,
migration, and invasion, and has been linked to several epithelial cancers, including breast, prostate, and
colorectal cancer. Despite its potential to facilitate several steps of the metastatic cascade and its link to epithelial
cancers, the specific role of EpCAM in metastasis remains unknown. In his study of normal tissues, primary
tumors, and metastatic nodules of 17 metastatic breast cancer patients, our collaborator Dr. Pedram Argani
determined that EpCAM protein expression was increased in metastatic nodules, without a corresponding
increase in EpCAM mRNA expression. We therefore hypothesize that post-translational modification of EpCAM,
which has three known N-glycosylation sites and no known O-glycosylation sites, stabilizes and increases the
abundance of EpCAM in metastatic tissues. Our recent study of these same samples found that the abundance
of N-glycans was significantly increased in metastatic tissues versus primary tumors versus normal tissues and
identified 25 significantly differentially abundant N-glycans of interest. Our study also found that EpCAM protein
expression was significantly increased in metastatic tissues compared to primary tumors and was significantly
statistically correlated with the expression of seven N-glycans. Taken together, these data suggest that EpCAM
N-glycosylation may play a role in metastatic progression. The central hypothesis of this project is that increases
and changes in N-glycosylation stabilize EpCAM and allow it to facilitate metastasis. I propose to test this
hypothesis through the following specific aims: Aim 1: To elucidate the impact of EpCAM N-glycosylation on
EpCAM stability and adhesion in human breast cancer cells; Aim 2: To assess the impact of EpCAM N-
glycosylation on metastasis in mouse models of breast cancer. These aims will be achieved through a
combination of cancer biology, biochemistry, and mass spectrometry approaches in human triple-negative breast
cancer cell lines and breast cancer xenograft models. This work is significant because it will elucidate the role of
N-glycosylation of EpCAM in metastatic breast cancer, determine the specific N-glycosylation profile of EpCAM
in metastasizing breast cancer cells, and may subsequently uncover novel therapeutic targets and strategies in
metastatic breast cancer."
10840381,"Project Abstract
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), a major component of the tumor stromal mass, demonstrate great
phenotypic heterogeneity and diverse functional capabilities under the influence of local tumor
microenvironment (TME). These TAMs generally display an anti-inflammatory, M2-type phenotype and can
facilitate tumor growth by promoting angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, as well as immune evasion.
However, it remains largely undefined exactly how these TAMs regulate anti-tumor immune responses within
the TME. The objective of this application is to understand the role of TAM-derived PD-L1/siglec-15 in inducing
intratumoral CD8 T cell dysfunction, to delineate mechanisms underlying PD-L1/siglec-15 upregulation in
TAMs as well as to develop novel strategies to promote intratumoral CD8 T cell infiltration and function in favor
of enhancing anti-tumor immunity. The long-term objective of this project is to understand signals required for
functional polarization of TAMs within the TME, and its contributions to immune cell dysregulations, cancer
development and progression, which may lead to the development of novel cancer therapeutic strategies."

Children and adolescents from low-income households are an important focus for human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccination because the risk of HPV-associated cancers for individuals from low socioeconomic status is
markedly higher (up to 20% for cervical, 20% for oropharyngeal, 17% for vulvar, and 50% for anal cancer). The
HPV vaccine protects up to six cancers (cervical, vaginal, vulvar, oropharyngeal, anal, and penile cancers) and
can reduce the incidence of these cancers by nearly 90% if administered before 17 years of age. However,
vaccination rates are suboptimal in many states. Texas (the state with 3rd highest burden of HPV-associated
cancer in the nation) has underperformed on HPV vaccination. Children from low-income families constitute
half of Texas’ HPV vaccine-eligible population. In 2018, only 30% of the boys and girls from low-income
families had received the recommended doses of the HPV vaccine. The lack of valid and robust area-level (ZIP
code level) estimates of vaccination rates for low-income children and adolescents is a major barrier to
strategizing vaccination efforts in Texas. Addressing these data deficiencies is necessary for mobilizing
resources and invigorating HPV vaccination outreach in Texas. The applicant proposing this K01 research (Dr.
Kalyani Sonawane) is a trained pharmacist and health services researcher who is well-positioned to address
disparities in HPV-associated cancer prevention. Kalyani will receive training in disparities research, advanced
data analytics and visualization, geospatial techniques, and ethics and dissemination under the mentorship of
nationally recognized experts Dr. Xianglin Du (cancer health services research and claims data analysis), Dr.
Anna R. Giuliano (HPV vaccine and HPV-associated cancer prevention), Dr. Maria E. Fernandez
(implementation and dissemination science research to reduce cancer disparities), Dr. Ashish A. Deshmukh
(population health with a focus on HPV and associated cancers), and Dr. Ruosha Li (biostatistical
methodologies for health care data research). This proposal will utilize cutting-edge methods devised for
healthcare data analytics to quantify area-level (5-digit ZIP code level) HPV vaccination rates by harnessing
healthcare claims information of over 4.8 million low-income children and adolescents (Aim 1). Sophisticated
geospatial models will be utilized to identify geographic areas that are underperforming on HPV vaccination
(Aim 2). Subsequently, a novel web-based portal will be created for HPV vaccination data visualization and
disseminating evidence-based HPV vaccination resources to healthcare providers (Aim 3). This K01 award will
provide Dr. Sonawane a structured and tailored mentoring program and resources for synthesizing preliminary
data that will be critical for her to become an independently funded investigator in cancer health disparities
research. The proposed work and subsequent research will invigorate outreach efforts for HPV-associated
cancer prevention in vulnerable individuals."
10821366,"ABSTRACT
 During development, the division of progenitor cells is tightly regulated in time and place to produce the
appropriate number and types of cells; misregulation of proliferation or differentiation can lead to
morphogenetic defects and a variety of developmental disorders. The δ-pcdhs are a family of homophilic cell
adhesion molecules that have been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism and epilepsy.
They have additionally been identified as tumor suppressor genes in an array of cancers. Our preliminary data
reveal that mutant zebrafish lacking individual δ1-pcdhs (pcdh1a, pcdh7a or pcdh9) or δ2-pcdhs (pcdh17,
pcdh18b or pcdh19) all display increased cell proliferation in the early neural tube, resulting in excess neurons
later in development. In a preliminary study using in vivo timelapse, we show by direct observation that the
spatiotemporal dynamics of cell divisions is altered in the mutants. We further provide evidence that the δ-
pcdhs are regulators of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and that both canonical Wnt signaling and the
Wnt receptor Ryk are required for the increased proliferation in δ-pcdh mutants. This proposal will test the
hypotheses that: 1) cell-cell interactions, mediated by δ-pcdhs, coordinate cell proliferation and neural
progenitor cell dynamics in the neuroepithelium; and 2) δ-pcdhs influence cell proliferation by regulating
canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling through Ryk. These experiments will elucidate the mechanics of
fundamental events in nervous system development and provide important insights both into the underlying
causes of neurodevelopmental disease and to the role of δ-pcdhs in cancer."
10812396,"Human exposure to environmental toxins such as those in tobacco related products are the leading cause of
preventable deaths in the United States, with the greatest effect on morbidity and mortality through promotion
of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the molecular mechanisms by which environmental exposures
increase CAD risk are not well understood. Furthermore, genes that might participate in gene by environment
interactions have been difficult to identify at the population level. Thus, our longterm goal is to use a reverse
genetics approach to study the interaction of xenobiotic toxins with relevant known CAD-associated genes.
One such gene is the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Well-known ligands of AHR are dioxins and poly-aryl
hydrocarbons, which are major components of tobacco smoke and known promoters of atherosclerosis in
animal models. Genes encoding AHR, its heterodimerization partner ARNT, and other factors in this pathway
are all linked to CAD risk through human genetic association studies. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq)
studies of smooth muscle cell (SMC)-specific Ahr knockout (KO) atherosclerotic mice showed a significant
increase in the proportion of phenotypic transition SMC that express chondrocyte markers, identifying cells we
term “chondromyocytes” (CMC). These findings were correlated with larger lesion size, increased lineage-
traced SMC contribution to the plaque, decreased lineage-traced SMC in the fibrous cap, and increased lesion
alkaline phosphatase activity in the Ahr KO mice. These findings reveal that Ahr expression in SMC inhibits
their transition to CMC and ameliorates vascular disease pathophysiology. These data are in contrast with a
number of studies showing that Ahr activation by xenobiotic ligands such as dioxin promote atherosclerosis,
and suggest a unique hypothesis. We postulate that Ahr normally has a beneficial effect on SMC in the
disease setting, inhibiting a harmful cell state transition to the CMC phenotype and disease
progression, and that this protective effect is blocked by xenobiotic toxin activation. We thus propose to
examine this hypothesis through the following Aims. In Aim 1, we will investigate how Ahr responds to
xenobiotic ligand activation in the disease setting, with respect to SMC phenotype and cellular lesion anatomy.
These studies will employ the Ahr SMC-specific conditional KO and SMC lineage traced ApoE KO
atherosclerosis model. Aim 2 will focus on the transcriptomic and epigenomic effects of xenobiotic ligand in
vivo activation with the same mouse disease model, with combined scRNAseq and single cell ATAC
sequencing (scATACseq). Finally, in Aim 3 we propose to employ human coronary artery SMC as an in vitro
model system to validate, and characterize the downstream pathways for, TFs identified in the previous Aim
that interact with AHR to regulate the phenotypic transition of SMC to chondromyocytes. These studies
investigate a highly innovative hypothesis, and will provide significant insights into cellular and molecular
mechanisms by which tobacco and other environmental risk factors promote CAD risk."
10809010,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death globally. Despite advancements in surgical approaches for
cardiovascular disease, up to 50% of vascular procedures such as balloon angioplasty, stenting, and surgical
bypass fail due to restenosis from neointimal hyperplasia in the treated artery, a cell proliferative process
potentiated by inflammation. New therapies for prevention and treatment of neointimal hyperplasia are urgently
needed. However, there are major knowledge gaps in understanding the complex contribution of environmental
effectors in this process. Compelling preliminary work by the PI using germ-free (GF) and antibiotic-treated
mouse models has demonstrated a novel meta-organismal pathway for neointimal hyperplasia susceptibility. We
have shown that GF mice have attenuated neointimal hyperplasia compared to conventionally-raised mice,
which is restored by fecal transplantation. Furthermore, antibiotic treatment to deplete gut microbiota results in
reduced levels of butyrate, a short chain fatty acid produced exclusively by microbial fermentation of dietary fiber,
which is accompanied by exacerbated neointimal hyperplasia susceptibility; these effects are reversed by
butyrate supplementation. Arterial expression of the butyrate receptor, free fatty acid receptor 3 (FFAR3), is
increased by injury, and stimulation of FFAR3 modulates endothelial (EC), vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC),
and inflammatory responses. Taken together, we now hypothesize that a meta-organismal microbe-host
interaction impacts neointimal hyperplasia following vascular surgery: prebiotic fiber augments gut microbial
production of butyrate; and butyrate, in turn, attenuates arterial injury-induced neointimal hyperplasia by direct
effects on EC and inflammation that are mediated by FFAR3. We will test this innovative hypothesis in a
comprehensive series of studies employing GF and transgenic mice, butyrogenic bacteria, and spatial and
dynamic profiling of the inflammatory response. We will also test the translational application of this pathway
using a novel formulation of encapsulated tributyrin, a butyrate precursor, in a pig model of arterial injury.
Collectively, these studies will test phenomenological, mechanistic, and translational facets of this pathway, thus
having a potentially transformative impact on patients undergoing vascular surgery."
10809006,"Atherosclerosis (AS) remains the leading cause of death world-wide and it is often associated with
dyslipidemia, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Macrophage is a type of innate immune cell that
plays a critical role in the development of AS. Unrestricted uptake of oxidized LDL (oxLDL) by macrophages
leads to accumulation of lipid intracellularly and foam cell formation, which is a hallmark of early stages of AS.
OxLDL uptake is mainly mediated by CD36, a scavenger receptor highly expressed on the macrophage
surface. One major problem is that oxLDL leads to up-regulation of CD36 expression through a transcription
factor PPARγ, resulting in a positive feedback mechanism to further enhance CD36-mediated oxLDL uptake.
Defining the novel regulator of this process is the central goal of this multi-PI proposal. Recent published and
preliminary studies showed that Pim1, a conserved serine/threonine kinase regulates CD36 transcription. In
addition, genetic ablation of pim1 gene in macrophages resulted in a reduction in PPARγ pathway as well as
the downstream targets involved in fatty acid metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. We thus
hypothesized that Pim1 kinase coordinates PPARγ activation/CD36 expression and mitochondrial functions to
regulate fatty acid metabolism and immune activation in macrophages. Continuous stimulation of Pim1 kinase
in macrophages contributes to pro-atherogenic phenotypes and AS. Specific aim 1 will determine the
molecular mechanism by which Pim1 kinase in macrophages coordinates PPARγ activation/CD36 expression
and mitochondrial function to modulate fatty acid metabolism. We will use a combination of genetically
modified macrophages, biochemical, immunological and ex vivo cell metabolic studies to determine the
mechanisms by which Pim1 kinase regulates fatty acid metabolism through the PPARγ/CD36 pathway; and to
determine the mechanisms by which Pim1 kinase regulates mitochondria morphology through Drp-1 and
define the impact on mitochondria fatty acid oxidation, oxidative phosphorylation and ROS production. Aim 2
will test the hypothesis that inactivating Pim1 kinase in vivo suppresses the development of AS. Using the
genetic pim1 ablation model and minipump infusion of the Pim inhibitor AZD1208, we aim to test the
hypothesis that Pim1 activity is indispensible for diet-induced AS in mice; and to test the hypothesis that
pharmacologic inhibition of Pim1 suppresses PPARγ/CD36 pathway and reprograms macrophage
mitochondria toward ROS production under atherogenic conditions; and test the hypothesis that Pim1
regulates bone marrow-monocyte-macrophage differentiation lineage under atherogenic conditions. By
elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which Pim1 kinase coordinates fatty acid metabolism and
mitochondrial functions to control macrophage activation under atherogenic conditions, we expect to gain
crucial knowledge on novel lipid metabolism regulators and provide new treatment strategies against AS."

Early pregnancy loss is the most prevalent early pregnancy complication, and its incidence is estimated to be
~75%. Thus, delineating the mechanisms of peri and post-implantation processes will help reduce this adverse
pregnancy outcome. Decidualization, a process of stromal cell proliferation and differentiation for the formation
of decidua, supports embryonic growth and survival from post-implantation through pre-placentation period.
Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and angiogenesis are underlying events that occur in parallel to the
decidualization. Fibrillar collagens are predominant ECM group of proteins which are abundant in the decidua,
endothelial cells, and vascular wall. However, their role in the endometrial decidualization, embryo invasion and
angiogenesis are not known. Our preliminary data suggests that the fibrillar collagen undergoes dramatic
remodeling within the decidua compared to non-decidualized pre-implantation endometrium. Utilizing a novel
mouse model, we provide compelling evidence that the fibrillar collagen is playing an indispensable role in
endometrial decidualization and angiogenesis. Conditional deletion of Col5a1 (collagen type V alpha 1 chain)
resulted in complete pregnancy failure due to severe intrauterine hemorrhage and total embryo resorption. Based
on these strong preliminary data, we propose to characterize the defects in endometrial decidualization and
embryo invasion which lead to total embryo resorption in the uterus lacking Col5a1(aim 1), characterize the
Col5a1-mediated fibrillar collagen remodeling that determines progression of decidualization and embryonic
growth (aim 2), and identify impaired angiogenesis and disrupted vascular remodeling as predominant underlying
mechanisms that cause intrauterine hemorrhage in Col5a1 conditional knockout mice (aim 3). We will utilize a
physiologically relevant and novel in vivo model – uterine specific Col5a1 conditional knockout mice – to
interrogate the function of fibrillar collagen in endometrial decidualization and angiogenesis. We will also utilize
a unique combination of approaches including imaging techniques and in vitro cell derived matrices. The
outcomes of this study will enhance our understanding on the function of fibrillar collagen during endometrial
decidualization and angiogenesis."

Aging is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) which is the most common form of dementia and
among the fastest growing causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. The risk factors for AD emerge
during midlife and are similar to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. In this regard, stiffening of the
large elastic arteries (i.e., the aorta and carotid arteries) and cerebral hypoperfusion occur with aging and are
linked to age-related cognitive impairment, primarily through the transmission of damaging pressure waves to
the cerebral vasculature, resulting in cerebrovascular dysfunction and neuronal damage. The impact of midlife
vascular changes on the brain are further exacerbated by poor lifestyle habits, including the consumption of a
diet that contains high amounts of added sugar (e.g., from ultra-processed foods containing high amounts of
fructose). While the exact mechanisms are not known, a high sugar diet is associated with elevated plasma
triglycerides (TGs), which may exacerbate age-related arterial dysfunction and memory impairment through a
mechanism involving increased systemic inflammation. Our cross-sectional preliminary data suggest that
plasma TGs are strongly associated with increased arterial stiffness, reduced cerebrovascular function, lower
memory scores and decreased integrity of the hippocampus, a brain structure that is critical for encoding and
recalling memories; however, it remains unknown how these factors are influenced by the consumption of added
sugars. The purpose of this project is to establish preliminary evidence for a causal link between added sugar
intake and adverse changes to vascular and brain health in midlife adults. Our central hypothesis is that excess
added sugar intake causes reductions and hippocampal structure and function though adverse changes to
arteries via a mechanism involving increased plasma TGs and systemic inflammation. We will conduct a
randomized, single-blind, controlled-feeding study to determine the effects of consuming a diet containing low
(5% of total energy intake) vs. high (25% of total energy intake) added sugar for 10-days each on measures of
large elastic artery stiffness, cerebrovascular function and hippocampal structure and function. The expected
outcome is evidence of a causal relation between added sugar intake and reductions in vascular and brain
functions through a mechanism involving increased TG's and inflammation. The data generated from this project
will support a future NIH R01 proposal for a randomized controlled trial aimed at lowering added sugar intake in
mid-life adults."

Dementia is a debilitating syndrome with many incapacitating symptoms requiring dependent care that is
emotionally and financially burdensome for patients and their families. Dementia is the 6th leading cause of
death in the United States with 47.5 million people worldwide currently living with dementia which is projected to
reach 75.6 million by 2030 and 135.5 million by 2050. Unfortunately, no therapies to treat dementia exist,
indicating a critical and urgent need for a better understanding of how dementia is initiated and progresses so
that new therapeutic approaches can be developed. Age-related stiffening of the large elastic arteries is a major
contributor to dementia but the mechanism(s) by which this occurs remain unknown. In healthy individuals,
pulsatile flow in large vessels is converted to continuous flow in cerebral µvasculature via pulsatility dampening
by large arteries. Repeated cycles of distension and relaxation over time induce irreversible elastin fragmentation
in large arteries which is replaced by stiffer collagen thereby diminishing compliance and dampening. This results
in the conversion from continuous to pulsatile flow in cerebral microvasculature accompanied by increases in
pulse pressure and pulse wave velocity. These pathological hemodynamics have been linked to cognitive decline
via neuronal injury, synaptic dysfunction, and neurodegeneration. While most hypotheses focus on shear-
induced injury mechanisms, endothelial cells and neurons are also sensitive to strain. We hypothesize that
induction of cyclic strain, in the microvessel wall and adjacent tissue, due to the conversion to pulsatile flow,
exacerbates shear-induced brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC) dysfunction and is the primary cause of
neuronal injury. We will test our hypotheses via fulfillment of two aims. (1) Investigate the independent, and
combined influences of, conversion to, and increases in, cyclic shear stress and cyclic strain on BMEC
dysfunction and inflammation. We hypothesize that conversion from continuous to pulsatile flow, and an increase
in pulse wave velocity, induce BMEC dysfunction and inflammation via exposure to increased cyclic shear stress.
We further hypothesize that cyclic strain in the microvascular wall, and increase in strain magnitude due to
increased pulse pressure, exacerbate shear-induced BMEC dysfunction. (2) Investigate the influence of cyclic
strain on neuronal injury. We hypothesize that as pulse pressure increases, the associated increase in strain will
induce neuronal injury via strain propagation into tissue and neurons adjacent to the vessel and that this process
worsens with age-related brain softening. The results of this proposal will provide significant insight into how
pathological hemodynamics induced by arterial stiffening lead to BMEC and neuronal injury."

The most common event preceding relapse of primary glomerular diseases like Minimal Change
Disease and Focal and Segmental Glomerulosclerosis is the common cold. Treatment of disease
relapse is a lengthy process involving glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive medications, some
of which have multi-system toxicity. We hypothesized that relapse is induced by a “cytokine storm” that
follows infection by common cold viruses like Rhinovirus. A “cytokine cocktail” was designed around
the soluble Rhinovirus receptor and induces acute albuminuria after single intravenous injection in mice
with low podocyte Zhx2 expression, a common feature in MCD and FSGS patients. This cytokine
cocktail comprises of components of the innate and adaptive immune response that are necessary and
sufficient to induce acute albuminuria. Exclusion of any member from the cytokine cocktail, or injection
of individual members does not induce albuminuria.
In this proposal, we will develop therapeutic strategies to prevent relapse of glomerular diseases after
a common cold, by depleting soluble cytokines in the cytokine storm, or blocking their receptors in the
glomerulus.
In Aim 1, studies on cytokine depletion or receptor blockage in the podocyte will be conducted, and
receptor dependent and independent mechanisms identified.
In Aim 2, studies on cytokine depletion or receptor blockage in endothelial and mesangial cells will be
conducted, and receptor dependent and independent mechanisms identified.
In Aim 3, a therapeutic strategy that combines cytokine depletion with receptor blockage will be
developed."

The cerebellum is a brain structure long known to be essential for coordinating the contraction of muscle groups
across joints to enable smooth and precise limb movement. Output pathways in the cerebellar nuclei are thought
to continuously generate rapid corrective signals that ensure precision during skilled movements through a
process termed online correction. Up until now it has been difficult to identify and characterize the specific neural
circuits that could implement this rapid refinement due to the lack of selective access to cerebellar output
pathways. Recent work has shown that a subset of cerebellar output neurons project directly to the spinal cord
(cerebello-spinal), providing a possible pathway for rapid and direct adjustments of the limb. However, little is
known about the precise influence direct cerebello-spinal (CbSp) projections have on motor output and the
timescale on which activity in these circuits may act to ensure the accuracy of dexterous behaviors. No research
has explicitly investigated whether direct projections from the cerebellum to the spinal cord mediate rapid, online
corrections. The overarching goal of this proposal is to define how output from the cerebellum enables skilled
movements, focusing specifically on the functional role of CbSp projections and their influence on forelimb
movements. The central hypotheses are: 1) CbSp projection neurons convey online corrective commands that
refine forelimb movement; and 2) this refinement is achieved through activity patterns that encode predictions
about limb kinematics or muscle activity. Employing a skilled water reaching assay, CbSp projections will be
optogenetically silenced during performance of behavioral tasks designed to introduce sources of movement
error, such as changing reach target location. Kinematic and electromyography (EMG) analyses of performance
will uncover the precise corrective role of CbSp neurons in forelimb movements. Next, multielectrode silicon
probes will be used to record from CbSp neurons during performance of the same water reaching tasks. Single
unit activity analyses and generalized linear models trained on kinematic and neural activity data will reveal
whether CpSp activity predicts corrective movements and encodes specific features such as muscle recruitment,
limb velocity, acceleration, or trajectory. Moreover, analysis of data from both Aims will determine whether CbSp
neurons mediate corrective signals to the forelimb during dexterous movements. This work will provide valuable
insight into the neural basis of dexterous movement by expanding knowledge of how the cerebellum facilitates
the speed and precision of forelimb behaviors. This research will help lay the groundwork for improved diagnosis
and treatment of cerebellar pathologies."

Osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma are the most common pediatric bone malignancies and efforts to treat
patients with advanced disease remain dismal, despite decades of research. To address this inadequacy, we
seek to leverage oncolytic virotherapy as a twofold attack against tumors: direct tumor cell lysis and antitumor
immune stimulation. However, previous trials of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) in pediatric sarcomas
displayed limited responses, likely due to immunosuppressive monocytes and macrophages. To improve
efficacy, we combined oHSV with trabectedin, an FDA-approved DNA-binding agent known to mitigate
monocytes and macrophages. Strikingly, we found that the efficacy of this combination far surpassed our
expectations, inducing complete regressions and increased survival in multiple models of Ewing sarcoma and
osteosarcoma. The mechanism for this synergy remains unknown and understanding it is critical to optimize
approaches to therapy in human trials. In our preliminary single-cell RNA sequencing data investigating this
synergy, we observed far more viral transcripts in combination-treated tumors than in oHSV-treated tumors and
a decrease in the expression of genes associated with the intrinsic antiviral response, suggesting that trabectedin
selectively sensitizes tumor cells to infection. We also found that oHSV induced increased TRAILR2 death
receptor expression in tumor cells and increased TRAIL expression in NK cells, pointing to a second potential
mechanism for synergy through cytotoxic signaling. Based on these data, we hypothesize that trabectedin
augments oHSV efficacy through mechanisms that include transcriptional inhibition of tumor-intrinsic
antiviral responses and enhanced NK-mediated cytotoxicity via TRAIL-TRAILR2 signaling. Firstly, we will
investigate the decreased intrinsic antiviral response and the oHSV-induced tumor cell death pathways under
combination therapy via proteomic methods, including mass cytometry (CyTOF), western blot, and multi-color
immunofluorescence. To observe the related tumor cell sensitivity to oHSV, we will construct a luminescent
oHSV and monitor its spread in real-time. Secondly, we will analyze TRAIL, TRAILR2, TRAILR2 inhibitors, and
caspase-8 pathway expressions using CyTOF, western blot, ELISA, multi-color immunofluorescence, and qPCR,
in combination-treated tumors compared to oHSV-treated tumors. To determine whether TRAILR2 signaling is
necessary for combination efficacy, we will use CRISPR-Cas9 to knock out tumor cell TRAILR2 and compare
single and combination treatment efficacies in wild-type and knock-out models. Ultimately, we will illuminate
mechanisms of synergy through a two-pronged analysis, with the potential to reveal numerous generalizable
vulnerabilities in osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma for clinical application and the development of future
synergistic treatments against pediatric sarcomas."

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most frequent and severe infections worldwide. Uropathogenic
Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the primary causative agent of UTI. UPEC ascension from the bladder (cystitis) to the
kidneys results in pyelonephritis (PN). Despite prompt antibiotic treatment, patients with PN can develop acute
kidney injury (AKI) and renal scarring, which can ultimately lead to end-stage renal disease. Currently, no therapy
is available to prevent the long-term sequelae following PN.
The innate immune system serves instrumental roles in controlling UTI and represents a potential therapeutic
target for UTI prevention and treatment. However, mounting evidence argues that dysregulated innate immune
responses can lead to persistent inflammation and renal scarring during PN. A greater understanding of the
cellular immune mechanisms underlying the development of renal inflammation and kidney fibrosis during PN
will lead to novel therapeutic strategies to treat UTI and prevent the development of detrimental sequelae.
I have recently demonstrated that neutrophils and macrophages have distinct roles during PN pathogenesis.
While neutrophils prevent widespread UPEC dissemination, macrophages promote pro-inflammatory and pro-
fibrotic immune responses during PN. The overall objective of this proposal is to investigate the functional roles
of neutrophils and macrophages in the development of kidney fibrosis and dysfunction after a PN episode.
My central hypothesis is that neutrophils eradicate UPEC and prevent permanent kidney damage, while macro-
phage-mediated inflammation drives kidney injury and renal scarring during PN.
The specific aims during this K award will test the following hypotheses: 1) Neutrophils have a protective antimi-
crobial function, while macrophages induce interstitial fibrosis and renal dysfunction during PN (Aim 1). 2) Mac-
rophages exert pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic functions during PN, which contribute to renal inflammation,
scarring, and reduced kidney function (Aim 2). 3) Neutrophil NOX2 limits bacterial dissemination during PN,
whereas macrophage NOX2 promotes oxidative stress and kidney injury (Aim 3). The proposed research will
use an innovative preclinical mouse model of APN that replicates the development of kidney fibrosis following
UTI and bridges methodologies in the areas of immunology, microbiology, molecular biology, and nephrology.
The expected outcomes from this proposal will reveal novel biological functions for macrophages and neutrophils
during PN, and will identify new targets that may alleviate PN-mediated sequelae.
This approach in combination with structured career development activities under the guidance of my mentors
and research advisory team, will prepare me to successfully compete for R01 funding and launch my career as
an independent scientist focused on resolving some of the most challenging obstacles in the treatment of UTI."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an extremely deadly tumor type with one-year and five-year
survival rates of less than 20% and 10% respectively. This project seeks to explore the potential for Krüppel-like
factor 5 (KLF5) to be a novel therapeutic target in PDAC. The proposed research leverages three key
discoveries. First, high-throughput genetic screening has revealed that PDAC human cancer cells are selectively
sensitive to KLF5 inactivation. Second, KLF5 expression is low in normal pancreas tissue, but KLF5 is
upregulated during pancreatitis and supports the proto-oncogenic function of Kras in this context. Third, mouse
genetic studies indicate that normal intestinal stem-cell self-renewal continues in the absence of Klf5. These data
together suggest KLF5 has a wide therapeutic index in PDAC. However, KLF5 is a difficult target for classical
drug discovery approaches, largely due to our limited understanding of protein-protein interactions which support
KLF5 function. This project will address two major gaps in our understanding of KLF5 in PDAC. It will evaluate
whether targeting KLF5 interactions disrupts KLF5 function, and it will explore how KLF5 contributes to proto-
oncogenesis of PDAC precursor cells.
An integrated high-throughput reporter screen and mass spectrometry analysis has illustrated that several KLF5
coactivators also bind KLF5. These coactivators will be deeply investigated to reveal the mechanisms of their
interactions with KLF5. This investigation will highlight whether KLF5-coactivator interactions are critical both for
KLF5 transcriptional activity and for PDAC cell fitness (Aim 1). The overall goal of this aim is to understand if
these interactions can be exploited to acutely target KLF5 activity in PDAC. This will inform the potential for the
advancement of KLF5 as a targeted therapy.
In addition, pancreatitis promotes an aberrant proto-oncogenic epigenetic landscape, and also leads to Klf5
upregulation. Using a transgenic mouse model, the function of Klf5 in normal and inflamed pancreatic tissue will
be interrogated. Specifically, this investigation will determine if Klf5 supports the aberrant epigenic profile induced
by pancreatitis (Aim 2). The overall goal of this aim will be to determine if Klf5 has an active role in shaping the
genome of PDAC progenitor cells. This might explain why PDAC is selectively sensitive to KLF5 deletion, while
KLF5 is entirely dispensable in normal pancreatic homeostasis.
The required skills and knowledge to carry out these two aims will be supported by sponsor Dr. Chris Vakoc and
co-sponsor Dr. David Tuveson, in addition to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory School of Biological Sciences.
The mentorship and environment at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory will provide all of the necessary resources
for a tailored training program to effectively develop the applicant into an independent experimentalist, analyst,
and communicator of gene regulation biology and cancer research."

10828778,"TRD 1: Quantitative Imaging of Physiological Markers
Lead Principal investigator: Hanzhang Lu, Professor of Radiology
Co-investigators: Jim Pekar, Qin Qin, Jun Hua, Peiying Liu, Wenbo Li
This TRD will develop physiological MRI techniques that provide quantitative and
biologically interpretable measures of the brain. We will develop methods to probe basal
physiological parameters including cerebral blood flow (CBF), bolus arrival time (BAT),
oxygen extraction fraction (OEF), and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. We will
also develop techniques to assess dynamic physiological parameters including
cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), arterial pulsatility, and vascular compliance (VC). We
will achieve these goals through systematic development of novel pulse sequences,
models, and data processing methods. To allow these sophisticated measures to be
obtained with clinically practical time, fast acquisition methods will be integrated into our
techniques such as compressed sensing, multi-band/simultaneous-multi-slice, parallel
imaging, variable-density spiral sampling, and stack-of-stars 3D acquisition. Multi-
contrast imaging (e.g. combining physiological with anatomic imaging) will be achieved
by MR Fingerprinting (MRF). To improve the speed and reliability of parametric
estimations, especially for MRF-type of acquisitions, deep learning methods will also be
applied. To ensure readiness of these techniques for biomarker testing, small-scale
standardization and compatibility assessments will be performed which include intra-
session, inter-session, inter-vendor, inter-rater test-retest, and cloud-based MRI data
processing. The development of the techniques will be conducted with close
interactions (so-called “push-pull relationship”) with the Collaborative Projects (CPs) and
in collaboration with other TRDs. Additionally, these tools, once fully tested, will be
disseminated to the Service Projects (SPs) and other interested researchers."
10834036,"TITLE: Selectivity and regulation of mRNA demethylation by iron-dependent dioxygenases
ABSTRACT: The long-term goals of this research program are to (1) define the structural and
molecular mechanisms that control the selectivity and function of RNA demethylase enzymes, (2)
develop new chemical tools to monitor RNA demethylation in cells, and (3) understand how the
key cofactor ascorbic acid interacts with RNA demethylases and other iron-dependent
dioxygenase family members to regulate their activity. Methyl modifications on mRNA tune
transcript function, are essential for mammalian cell fate decisions, and play important roles in
the progression of many human cancers. The iron-dependent dioxygenase enzymes FTO and
AlkBH5 act as ‘erasers’ of highly abundant N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications found in the
mRNA body and, in the case of FTO, N6,2’-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) modifications found on
the 5’ mRNA cap. These RNA demethylases are overexpressed in cancers including glioblastoma
and acute myeloid leukemia, where increased demethylation activity and reduced methyl
modification levels promote tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Despite these clear links to
human disease, we currently have a poor understanding of how FTO and AlkBH5 recognize their
biological substrates, which mRNA transcripts are targeted for demethylation, and how
demethylation influences mRNA function. Furthermore, FTO and AlkBH5 belong to the non-heme
iron(II) and -ketoglutarate-dependent family of dioxygenases that require ascorbic acid (vitamin
C) as a cofactor for efficient activity, but we have almost no structure-level insights into how
ascorbic acid interacts with this diverse family of enzymes and how this physical interaction may
potentiate dioxygenase activity in cells. This proposal combines approaches from biochemistry,
structural biology, chemical biology, bioinorganic chemistry, and cell biology to determine the
structural basis for RNA demethylase selectivity, develop novel probes to map demethylation
targets across the transcriptome, and quantify and visualize the dioxygenase-ascorbic acid
interaction to understand how this cofactor regulates enzymatic activity. The results from these
proposed studies will significantly enhance our understanding of how cellular mRNA
demethylation is regulated in cells and pave the way for therapeutics that target demethylation
pathways in challenging cancers such as glioblastoma."

The Northwestern Postgraduate Training Program in Cutaneous Biology (NPTCB) seeks to train highly motivated
postdoctoral fellows for an academic career focused on cutaneous biology. The NPTCB provides an integrated
curriculum designed to: 1) educate trainees in critical thinking, writing/presentation skills, the peer-review pro-
cess, and the responsible conduct of research; and 2) provide stage-appropriate mentorship to ensure profes-
sional development. These aims are achieved through frequent reviews with the Primary Mentor and Mentorship
Committees as well as participation in formal didactics and seminars. Our Primary Mentors come from an inter-
disciplinary cohort of internationally recognized scientists (and mentors-in-training) focused on cutaneous biol-
ogy. These scientific leaders, who will serve as the primary mentors for our trainees, have appointments not only
in the Department of Dermatology, but also in other elite departments in the university (among them Medicine,
Microbiology/Immunology, Biomedical Engineering, and Chemistry). Their research spans one or more of the
five areas of research concentration highlighted in this renewal application: 1) Biomedical Engineering and Aug-
mented Intelligence, 2) Nanotechnology, 3) Genomics/Epigenomics, 4) Skin Immunology, and 5) Cell and De-
velopmental Biology of the Skin. In addition, our trainees have a mentorship committee that includes a Resource
Faculty member (an internationally recognized scientist with recognized mentoring skills) and a member of the
NUPTCB Career Development and Retention Committee. The “in lab training” will be supplemented by a formal
program of educational enrichment activities. This includes didactic coursework and a wide variety of seminars
that dovetail with the areas of research focus, e.g., the “Bench to Bedside” lecture series, journal clubs, and
“Research in Progress” meetings. We also have a unique “Road to Translational Research” mentoring team,
which enables all trainees to become familiar with the process of moving forward in translational research. The
grant is administered by four, highly collaborative committees. These include the Executive Committee (which
oversees the training program), a prestigious Internal Advisory Committee (who work with formal evaluation
programs to provide feedback to improve the program), the Career Development and Retention Committee
(dedicated to mentoring trainees through the transition to junior faculty), and the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
Committee (whose mission is to ensure we have a diverse and equitable applicant pool and trainee selection
process). Our trainees comprise an outstanding cohort of MD, MD/PhD, and PhD scientists who are passionate
about cutaneous biology. As a measure of our success, the Northwestern University Postgraduate Training Pro-
gram in Cutaneous Biology (NUPTCB) has trained 13 postdoctoral fellows during the last 11 years, of whom 11
remain in academics (6 as faculty). In summary, we have the applicant pool, the leadership, advisory committees,
faculty mentors, and infrastructure to train future leaders in the field of dermatology and skin biology/engineering.
These factors make Northwestern University an ideal site for this Training Program in Cutaneous Biology."

This proposal describes the continuation of the Training Program in the Neuroscience of Human Cognition.
A group of 23 faculty preceptors—investigating perception, attention, memory, emotion, problem solving,
language, pain, sleep, motor control, and cognitive control—has been assembled to participate in training
the next generation of cognitive neuroscientists at Northwestern University. The training program is led by
Ken Paller (Director), Christina Zelano (Associate Director), and an Internal Steering Committee, with
annual input from members of an External Advisory Committee. Pre- and postdoctoral trainees are selected
through a highly competitive process on the basis of factors including prior scientific training, proposed
research, scientific potential. Funding from the Northwestern Graduate School supports Affiliate Trainees (at
least 3 per year) who also participate in the program. Trainees conduct their research under the guidance of
one or more preceptors affiliated with many different departments and centers within the university. To
provide thorough training in all facets of cognitive neuroscience, the training program brings together a
diverse set of perspectives to facilitate a broad range of methodological, computational, and theoretical
endeavors. Exceptional opportunities are provided for trainees to learn from and closely interact with local
and visiting faculty members, and with other trainees, in the service of expanding their capacity for rigorous
and creative research on the neural substrates of cognition and associated translational opportunities.
Trainees gain from frequent in-depth research discussions with a network of scientists outside their home
lab, including regular presentations and critique of their own work. Trainees often bridge the distinct areas of
expertise of two mentors through novel interdisciplinary collaborations, expanding their breadth of training.
Concerted efforts focus on inclusiveness, including historically marginalized groups, and fostering a
diversity of perspectives, which enriches the whole program. This T32 mechanism solidifies a community for
all involved in human cognitive neuroscience at the university, while facilitating novel research orientations
and innovative strategies. Value-added benefits for trainees include a rich array of activities that supplement
standard research training, allowing them to expand their training beyond lab and departmental boundaries
in ways that would otherwise not be possible. The community fosters training in specific research skills,
while also supplying relevant knowledge to help trainees gain independence and become better scientists.
Faculty monitor this training through formal advising, written and oral scientific communication, regular
evaluations, and with attention to all aspects of career development. A chief goal of the program is to
provide top-rated comprehensive training to young scientists who will become future innovators and leaders
in human cognitive neuroscience, contribute to NIH research, and ultimately bring their skills to bear on a
variety of scientific endeavors pertinent to health and disease."

The rapid development and advancement of technologies and knowledge in molecular biology and genetics
have led to major breakthroughs in cancer etiology research. The field of cancer epidemiology is moving
rapidly toward a new era in which interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary collaborative research is the central
theme. This necessitates a growth of workforce of scientists working at the interfaces of epidemiology,
molecular biology, and genetics. The Vanderbilt Training Program in Molecular and Genetic Epidemiology of
Cancer (Vanderbilt-MAGEC), launched in 2012 with NCI R25 funding and currently supported by a T32 grant,
is designed to fill the gap with a goal of providing postdoctoral fellows from a variety of disciplines with the
methodological tools, practical laboratory and survey-research knowledge, and hands-on research and grant
writing experience necessary to launch an independent career in the molecular and genetic epidemiology of
cancer. The specific aims of the Vanderbilt MAGEC program are: 1) To recruit ethnically-diverse candidates
with strong backgrounds in epidemiology, genetics, and/or biology. 2) To deliver individualized didactic training
tailored to complement each trainee’s prior training background and launch them into their desired career
paths (molecular or genetic epidemiology of cancer). This training consists of courses, seminars, studios,
journal clubs, conferences and research grant preparation. 3) To establish a multi-disciplinary mentor team for
each trainee and integrate trainees into NCI-funded cancer epidemiology research projects. 4) To evaluate the
impact of the Vanderbilt MAGEC program by tracking short- and long-term outcomes. Expected short-term
outcomes for all trainees include publishing high-quality papers in peer-reviewed journals and submitting a
grant proposal to an internal or external funding agency based on the NIH format. Long-term outcomes include
cancer research career placements and NIH grant funding. The MAGEC program, built upon an outstanding
research and education training environment; a pool of 31 excellent, well-funded researchers and educators;
100 ongoing, cutting-edge research projects; exceptional data/biospecimen and population resources; and a
rich history of interdisciplinary training, has met remarkable success during the current grant cycle. During the
last 4 years and 9 months, 12 fellows received or are currently receiving MAGEC training; of these, 2
graduated trainees obtained faculty positions, and both received K12 fellowship awards, and one received two
additional career development awards. Another five graduated fellows are working in research-intensive
settings. Trainees contributed to 56 publications, 30 as first author. The program is mature and is in an
excellent position to continue growing. The renewal program will support 6 postdoctoral fellows. The expected
training duration for the MAGEC program is 3 years. Continued support of the program is essential for
sustaining its success and extending its impact on training a new generation of elite molecular and genetic
cancer epidemiologists and leaders in the new era of precision medicine and prevention."

The T32 Training Program in Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism at Stanford University (Endocrine T32)
serves a national need to train physician and basic scientists in the fields of diabetes, endocrinology and
metabolism. The Endocrine T32 has a remarkable 46-year record of rigorous scientific training; producing
numerous current and emerging endocrine research leaders. The goal of this renewal is steadfast pursuit of this
critical purpose. The Endocrine T32, the only postdoctoral research training program in diabetes, endocrinology
and metabolism at Stanford, is integrated into an extraordinary research environment, including the Stanford
Diabetes Research Center, and unparalleled training activities, seminars and resources. The training program
will provide M.D. and Ph.D. postdoctoral trainees (four per year, evenly split), a uniquely rich and supportive
environment to learn innovative research approaches. Supported by the Endocrine T32 for two years, trainees
will pursue cutting-edge research in the laboratories of remarkably accomplished investigators and experienced
mentors. The training faculty include 28 investigators from nine basic science and clinical Departments, whose
interests converge on four themes (Islet and Beta-cell Biology; Obesity, Metabolism and Diabetes Complications;
Interventional and Population Diabetes; Endocrinology and Population Health Sciences); integrating a wide
spectrum of diabetes- and endocrinology-focused laboratory, clinical, translational, epidemiologic and health
disparities research. Mentors will participate in formal training workshops to ensure supportive and inclusive
training. Trainees will receive a structured curriculum of study that includes weekly seminars, an Endocrine T32
specific series (where they present and critique the work of others) and career-pertinent didactic courses,
including the Responsible Conduct of Research, biostatistics and computation/computer programming. These
efforts foster a stimulating, cohesive and productive training experience that engenders the knowledge and skills
necessary to emerge research leaders. To safeguard trainee success, they will formulate a Career Development
Committee that assesses research progress, encourages professional development and co-navigates the trepid
transition to independence. Over the past 15 years, 85% of our trainees have remained in science; to continue
this success, trainees will develop and submit Career Award applications through participation in grant-writing
bootcamp. In recognition of the challenging, long gestation of (physician) scientists, robust (>$300,000 per year)
institutional support that augments trainee salary and bridge funding will be provided. The Program will take
concrete steps to address a historic lack of inclusivity, including Internal and External Advisory Committees with
expertise in the recruitment and retention of underrepresented individuals and that ensure programmatic
accountability. The goal of this Training Grant is to educate a diverse cadre of promising postdoctoral (physician)
scientists that become the future leaders of academic, governmental and industrial in endocrine research."
10817786,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We seek to discover novel biomarkers and drug targets for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and related
disorders. FTD is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder that demonstrates substantial clinical, genetic, and
pathological overlap with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Although both diseases can display TAR DNA-
binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, much remains unknown about the underlying mechanisms. It has been
suggested that RNA processing pathways play a vital role, which is exemplified by the description of mutations
in genes encoding RNA-binding proteins and the abundance of splicing defects in TDP-43 proteinopathies.
 Given the fact that long-read sequencing techniques have a higher accuracy in splice junctions, a better
recovery of large transcripts, and detect more alternative splicing events than traditional sequencing methods
that rely on short reads, we will produce full-length long-read transcriptomic data. We will examine a well-
characterized pathological cohort of patients belonging to the FTD-ALS spectrum for whom frontal cortex and
cerebellar tissue are available. Additionally, we will create single-nuclei long-read sequencing data, enabling us
to determine in which cell type specific transcript variants are detected. This innovative approach will allow us
to capture transcriptomic diversity, aiding the identification of novel, disease-specific, and/or disease-relevant
transcript variants (Aim 1). We will compare the RNA signature observed in the brain to that seen in a large
collection of clinical blood specimens. Moreover, we will assess differences between presymptomatic and
symptomatic individuals and evaluate changes over time. These studies give us the ability to reveal interesting
biomarker candidates, which will be validated in our extensive biospecimen collection (Aim 2). To elucidate the
mechanisms underpinning these diseases, we will also perform in-depth mechanistic studies using various cell
culture models, in vivo systems, and post-mortem tissues from patients along the FTD-ALS spectrum (Aim 3).
 Our original strategy, thorough characterization, and precious sample collection, will accelerate the
discovery of pathological mechanisms, druggable targets and translatable biomarkers, which are highly
valuable in preparation of future clinical trials for FTD and related disorders."
10836448,"Abstract
Transplantation of neural progenitor cells has extraordinary potential for the treatment of many nervous system
disorders. Several recent studies have shown that progenitor cells derived from the embryonic mouse medial
ganglionic eminence (MGE) retain a unique ability to migrate and differentiate into GABAergic interneurons
following transplantation into the juvenile or adult rodent brain. We recently demonstrated that these cells are
effective in correcting memory impairments and preventing spontaneous seizures in a mouse model of
traumatic brain injury. However, it is not known whether similar therapeutic effects can be achieved with
clinically-relevant cell sources, such as human pluripotent stem cells. Here, we propose studies to evaluate the
effect of human-derived interneurons in a pre-clinical model of traumatic brain injury. Our approach involves
transplantation of human interneuron progenitors into a widely-used rodent model of closed-head injury at
different stages following injury followed by in vitro patch-clamp recordings, immunofluorescence techniques
and neural circuit mapping to evaluate the synaptic integration of grafted neurons. A battery of behavioral
assays and video-EEG monitoring will also be applied. Two specific aims are proposed: (i) determine how
human-derived GABA progenitors integrate into brain injured hippocampus, and (ii) test the therapeutic
efficacy of human GABA neurons in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury. If successful, our results will help
move these exciting technologies closer to the clinic by establishing relatively direct proof of concept for human
interneuron transplantation to treat traumatic brain injury."
10824271,"Abstract. Chagas disease is a neglected tropical disease and has been designated as a research priority by
NIAID and an SBIR Research Topic of Interest. Six million individuals are infected and 8,000 deaths were caused
by Chagas in 2015 in mostly Central and South America by advanced forms of the disease such as Chagas
hemorrhagic fever. The cost associated with Chagas disease treatment globally is estimated to be ~$7 billion.
Chagas disease is caused by the parasitic protist Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) and spread by Triatominae, or
""kissing bugs"". While endemic in South America, it is spread to people living elsewhere due to immigration of
infected patients and travel to endemic regions. No vaccine is currently available and the only drugs used to treat
Chagas, the nitro aryl compounds nifurtimox and benznidazole, lose effectiveness in the chronic phase as the
parasite develops resistance, and they cause limiting adverse events as well. New medications acting via novel
mechanisms are urgently needed to eliminate the parasite in chronic patients suffering and dying from Chagas
disease. Novel compounds synthesized at Fox Chase Chemical Diversity Center (FCCDC) have been tested at
multiple collaborator sites: GSK Tres Cantos Open Lab Foundation in Tres Cantos, Spain; New York University;
University Of Dundee, Scotland; and the Swiss Tropical Public Health Institute, all research facilities dedicated
to curing neglected tropical diseases. The analogs tested displayed excellent activity against the T. cruzi parasite
in both its replicative (amastigote) and infective (trypomastigote) forms as found in phenotypic screening assays.
The compounds do not act through any known mechanism of action and display little to no toxicity to host cells,
unlike the standards of care nifurtimox and benznidazole. Further, in vivo testing in a murine model for Chagas
disease (NYU) confirmed potent antiparasitic activity. The lead compounds are proprietary to FCCDC and a
provisional U.S. patent application has been filed. The activity seen for the series has generated great interest
at the non-profit Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi). DNDi evaluates many potential international
collaborations each year but only selects the most promising for resource investment. Following evaluation of
our project, DNDi has committed additional T. cruzi testing gratis at both the University of Dundee and the Swiss
Tropical and Public Health Institute in order to evaluate potency and investigate mechanism of action. Our Aims
to develop this chemotype from lead compound to preclinical candidate is (1) Optimize the potency by exploring
the SAR of our novel lead using iterative medicinal chemistry synthesi, (2) characterize the biochemical
properties of the compounds to optimize antiparasitic activity (NYU, DNDi), and (3) perform in vivo tests in acute
and chronic Chagas disease mouse models (NYU) as well as evaluate and improve ADME properties of
advanced leads as required. The goal of this program is to complete many of the studies necessary for filing an
Investigational New Drug (IND) application for new agents to treat Chagas disease as monotherapy or in
combination with existing agents."

 Bone fracture is a large medical problem in the US, with 6 million presentations each year, resulting in
very large cost burdens. In addition, the total burden of fractures in the US is growing due to the aging of the
population and increases in osteoporosis. Some of these fractures do not heal properly, largely due to infections
resulting in high additional costs and morbidity in this subset of patients. Also, open fractures, often caused by
trauma, can lead to a very high rate of infection (20-30%), which might result in nonunion or amputation even
with the best of care. Reducing this significant burden to both the quality of life of the patients affected and to
the US public health and health systems is a very significant need. Bisphosphonates (BPs) are a class of
therapeutic compounds used to treat bone resorptive disorders, and accumulate in bone with exceptionally high
affinity, which makes them an excellent moiety for a novel bone targeted drug delivery platform.
 BioVinc is a company founded to be a leader in bone related diseases and has an extensive amount of
preliminary data showing the feasibility of using novel bone targeted bisphosphonate conjugated fluoroquinolone
compounds as a treatment for bone fracture healing problems. In this FastTrack SBIR proposal we will move the
BioVinc solution for infected delayed/non-union fracture toward commercial use. Our plan is to identify the ideal
clinical development candidate and complete the necessary nonclinical studies in order to advance our lead to
the stage of IND enabling studies to support IND application for first in human safety trials. In order to determine
the optimal doses of the conjugates and to get an initial safety assessment of the pharmacokinetics and
toxicology, studies will be conducted to confirm the opportunity for a development pathway. Specifically, we will
carry out two phases with four aims: Phase I Aim One. Improve synthesis of the BP-fluoroquinolone lead
compound to demonstrate that scale up to commercial quantities will be feasible; Phase I Aim Two. Carry out
initial pharmacokinetic studies in the mini pig to demonstrate skeletal exposure in the animal to be used for
pivotal IND enabling efficacy studies; Phase II Aim One. Further improve synthetic methodology to allow the
preparation of the BP-fluoroquinolone at the 50-100 gram scale to provide material to support efficacy studies in
mini pig and develop the process chemistry for large scale synthesis of the lead compound transferable to kg
GMP production with preliminary salt and polymorph screening; Phase II Aim Two. Test the lead compound for
its efficacy in the mini pig model of surgical repair of fractures.
 Successful completion of the proposed work will provide the preclinical data necessary to commercialize
our innovative product for use in infected fractures. This will meet a significant unmet medical need to reduce
the morbidity and mortality associated with poor healing, multiple surgeries, relapse, and extended hospital stays
due to the need for lengthy recoveries and daily IV therapy that often proves unsuccessful."

The cysteine protease caspase-6 (Casp6) has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases
for over fifteen years. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Casp6 is colocalized with amyloid plaques and
tau tangles in human brain, and both human and animal model data indicate that activated Casp6
contributes to neuronal inflammation, neurodegeneration, and cleavage of proteins to toxic forms.
Humans and mice lacking Casp6 are healthy and resistant to inflammation; furthermore, Casp6
knockout in 5xFAD mice bearing familial AD mutations in presenilin1 and amyloid beta precursor
protein (APP) show reduced levels in neuronal degeneration and inflammation. Thus, selective
inhibition of Casp6 could be safe and effective in treatment of AD. To this end, we propose to
design, synthesize and profile potent and highly selective inhibitors of the activated form of Casp6
(aCasp6) based on our initial SAR established for SU110 and SU134. These novel compounds
gain selectivity by binding covalently to a unique cysteine residue not found in other members of
the caspase family. While both SU110 and SU134 have promising drug-like properties, including
low nanomolar inhibition of aCasp6 in biochemical and cell-based assays, low toxicity, few off-
targets in proteome-wide studies, serum exposures 100-fold higher than cellular IC50, 50-77% oral
bioavailability, and up to 23% brain/plasma exposure, we will further explore the SAR to identify
compounds with improved PK and brain penetration properties (Aim 1). We will conduct standard
mouse PK experiments to determine oral bioavailability and to define structure–brain exposure
relationships. For Aim 2, we have developed a click-based probe of aCasp6 binding that
demonstrates sufficient potency and selectivity to use as an ex vivo activity-based probe of
aCasp6. We will use this probe, in conjunction with aCasp6 protein half-life determination and
measurement of the aCasp6 substrate tau, to determine the lifetime of target inhibition by
optimized aCasp6 inhibitors in cells; these data will be used in Phase II of the project to assess
target engagement in animals. From these SAR, PK and tissue distribution studies, we will identify
the most appropriate compounds to conduct PD assays and disease models to be run during
Phase II of the project. In the subsequent Phase II application, we will develop biomarker assays
and evaluate changes in these biomarkers after treatment with optimized lead compound in the
5xFAD model and additional animal models of AD. The conclusion of Phase II studies will be
refinement of the Target Candidate Profile and will anticipate the selection of a development
candidate for IND-enabling studies."

Impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) remains a major issue in type 1 diabetes (T1D) affecting ~30%
of all adults with T1D who are at high risk of severe hypoglycemia. Interventions including hybrid closed-loop
(HCL) and education have been developed, which reduce time in hypoglycemia in the hope that IAH will be
reversed. All have shown benefit, but many individuals do not respond. Our objective is to identify the most
effective treatments according to specific clinical characteristics.
We will run two multi-center, unblinded, two-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
over 12 months with a 2-4 week run-in (with continued follow-up for 24 months). Our trial interventions are,
HCL, blood glucose awareness training (BGAT), Recovery of Hypoglycemia Awareness in Long-
Standing Type 1 Diabetes ‘HypoCOMPaSS’ and Hypoglycemia Awareness Restoration Program for
adults with type 1 diabetes and problematic hypoglycemia despite optimized self-care ‘HARPdoc’.
We will assess the impact of these interventions on restoration of impaired sympatho-adrenal responses to
experimental hypoglycemia and restoration of clinical hypoglycemia awareness in T1D. Trial 1 is an RCT in
those with IAH, HCL naïve, in two treatment arms (HCL vs. BGAT). At 6 months, the BGAT group will be
provided with HCL, both groups then followed-up at 12 & 24 months. Trial 2 is an RCT in IAH persisting
despite using HCL for at least 6 months with randomization to HypoCOMPaSS or BGAT for 6 months. At 6
months, those with restored awareness will continue in both arms for a further 6 months and then assessed at
12 & 24 months. Participants with persistent IAH at 6 months will enter an exploratory study and receive
HARPdoc for 6 months with assessments at 12 & 24 months. Trials 1 and 2 will recruit in total at least 1000
participants across 10 centers, aged 18 to 85 years old, T1D >1 year duration with IAH, including 10-15% of
older adults (³70 years and/or with cardiovascular disease) who will be randomized to all interventions
excluding glucose clamps and will be assessed for IAH by questionnaires.
The primary outcome is epinephrine response at a clamped glucose of 45 mg/dL comparing the two study
arms in both trials at 6 months post-randomization. Secondary outcomes (at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months)
include additional counter-regulatory hormone responses, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics, C-
peptide, HbA1c, patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) including IAH scales, severe hypoglycemia and
safety data. All participants will measure CGM metrics, IAH by questionnaire, and report hypoglycemia,
PROMs and other data over 2 years to measure ‘real world’ sustainability but will not repeat hypoglycemic
clamps at 24 months unless other measures of IAH prove unreliable in reflecting impaired epinephrine
responses at 12 months. Overall, these studies will enable future research in developing specific interventions
for IAH and lead to more effective therapeutic pathways."

The cytokine IFN-γ controls both protective and pathogenic host responses during
Toxoplasma gondii infection. By activating hemopoietic and non-hemopoietic cell
autonomous resistance mechanisms, this cytokine mediates toxoplasmastatic and
toxoplasmacidal activities that control pathogen replication. Much less is known about
how the same cytokine regulates host sickness responses. We have recently obtained
data indicating that IFN-γ regulates the systemic levels of the stress hormone GDF-15,
without affecting tissue levels of the hormone. GDF-15 is produced by a variety of immune
and tissue cell types in response to a broad range of stressors and acts through the
GFRAL-receptor expressed in the hindbrain to suppress appetite and induce weight loss.
Circulating GDF15 levels are elevated in a wide range of human diseases states including
infections and cancer and is often associated with poor clinical outcomes. GDF-15 has
been reported to have immunomodulatory effects on macrophages and lymphocytes.
Consistent with its systemic regulation by IFN-γ, IL-10 deficient animals infected with T.
gondii exhibit higher levels of circulating GDF-15. Thus we hypothesize that GDF-15 may
be a principal mediator of the pathogenic effects of IFN-γ that promote sickness
responses during T. gondii infection. Our experimental aims utilize a combination of
genetic and immunological approaches to rigorously evaluate our hypothesis that GDF-
15 mediates the effects of IFN-γ to promote sickness responses during Toxoplasma
infection. Our discovery that an immune cytokine controls of the systemic availability of
the stress hormone GDF-15 is an novel finding and may have implications for the
management of disease conditions associated with “cytokine storms”. Specific Aim 1 will
interrogate the role of specific proinflammatory cytokines in inducing elevations in tissue
GDF-15 levels during infection. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that IFNγ triggers
the release of GDF-15 from tissue stores by promoting its maturation and release,
putatively through a TRANS-cellular mechanism. Specific Aim 3 will interrogate the role
and function of endogenous GDF-15 in regulating the immune and sickness responses
in wildtype and IL-10-deficient mice during T. gondii infection. Completion of this project
will provide fundamental insights into how immune cytokines control the host sickness
response during infection. These insights may provide avenues to promote health by
decreasing disease sequelae that result from hyperactivation of immune response."

Hematopoiesis primarily takes place within the dense milieu of the bone marrow. It is regulated by complex
signaling interactions among multiple cell types to maintain a balanced blood pool and to respond to injuries
such as bleeding and infection. During aging, hematopoiesis declines and develops clonal dominance, also
known as clonal hematopoiesis, where a small number of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs)
produce a disproportionately large amount of blood cells. Clonal hematopoiesis has been associated with
various types of hematologic disorders including leukemia. To understand how and why clonal hematopoiesis
develops with age, it is crucial to examine the key intercellular communications that regulate hematopoiesis
within the bone marrow. This is particularly important because of dramatic age-associated changes to the bone
marrow where the cell number substantially decreases and the cell type composition massively shifts, leading
to changes in the intercellular signaling network critical for hematopoiesis. Here, we will apply a new genomic
recording and imaging technique, MEMOIR (Memory through Enhanced Mutagenesis with Optical In-situ
Readout), to analyze how the aging bone marrow environment alters HSPC intercellular signaling and
influences clonal hematopoiesis. We will test two opposite hypotheses: (1) clonal hematopoiesis is induced by
age-associated changes to the intercellular signaling of HSPCs in the bone marrow; and alternatively (2) clonal
hematopoiesis is the result of intrinsic changes in HSPCs that allow them to escape from the control of the
intercellular signaling network. We will determine how aging alters the spatial context and intercellular signaling
of HSPCs, and influences their clonal expansion. And we will investigate how age-associated spontaneous
mutations perturb the spatial context and intercellular signaling of HSPC clonal expansion. Our proposed study
will identify the lineage relationships and spatial organization of individual HSPCs as well as their intercellular
signaling in the aging bone marrow. Our results can reveal new cellular and molecular players underlying
clonal hematopoiesis that could be used as therapeutic targets to control hematopoietic aging and age-related
diseases. More generally, this study will provide an experimental and conceptual framework for analyzing
spatially defined intercellular communication in hematopoiesis."

Although improvements have been made to the antimalarial drug discovery pipeline over the past decade a
substantial risk remains that many new drug candidates may fail in clinical trials due to the rapid emergence of
drug resistant parasites. The longterm goal of this research is to design better preclinical drug candidates for
both malaria and to understand why treatments may fail. Over the past decade, our investigative team has
established robust methodologies for discovering and characterizing genes involved in multidrug resistance and
has assembled a large dataset of genes and alleles that mediate or are associated with multidrug resistance.
The overall objective of this application is to extend and leverage these data to determine when, how and why
antimalarial drug resistance or persistence emerges. Our central hypothesis is that the emergence of clinical
drug resistance can be predicted using in vitro evolution assays. We also posit that resistance parameters may
differ substantially between current field isolates exposed to modern first-line drugs and other selective
pressures, as compared with reference laboratory strains isolated decades ago. Our hypotheses will be tested
by pursuing three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will use adaptive laboratory evolution and deep whole-genome
sequencing to obtain a high-resolution view of drug resistance acquisition. To accomplish this, we will define the
extent to which a parasite’s genetic background plays a role by comparing results from recent African, Asian and
South American clinical isolates to those obtained with laboratory strains dating back >40 years. We will also
test whether these strains differ fundamentally in their mutational paths, levels of and time to resistance, the
minimum inoculum of resistance and the impact of resistance on parasite fitness. We will also answer the critical
question of whether resistance liabilities are more a function of the target or of the chemotype, parameters that
contribute to resistance emergence such as number of genome replication events and the number of different
alleles and whether different chemical chemotypes interacting with a given drug target give different results. In
Aim 2, we will seek to understand mechanisms of resistance in a panel of poorly understood mediators. These
studies will combine conditionally regulated genetic, proteomic, cellular and structural approaches to studying
the impact of genetic changes conferring resistance on parasite biology. In Aim 3, we will explore the role that
P. falciparum genes play in mediating drug tolerance as a means to survive antiplasmodial pressure. Innovation
includes characterizing the evolution of resistance in geographically distinct modern field isolates instead of
relying entirely on historical laboratory strains. Novelty includes assessing whether the resistance risk is driven
by the target or the chemotype,and defining the role for tolerance in surviving antimalarial exposure. This
research is significant because it will alter the way in which drug candidates are selected prior to extensive
clinical and preclinical studies, ideally at the early lead stage."
10791855,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal will test the hypothesis that learning and memory can be improved by using computationally
designed training protocols that optimize the interactions among kinase cascades and transcription factors
involved in the induction of long-term memory (LTM). Three model systems will be used: long-term sensitization,
fear conditioning and extinction, and inhibitory avoidance learning. This hypothesis is based on our previous
work demonstrating that computationally designed protocols maximizing the overlap of activities between protein
kinase A (PKA) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) isoform termed extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) enhance long-term synaptic facilitation (LTF) and LTM for sensitization, as well as the acquisition
and extinction of fear learning. This proposal has two key innovative aspects. First, we utilize a novel, multi-
disciplinary strategy to enhance learning and improve different types of memory retrieval. Pharmacological
interventions to improve learning and memory, and rescue memory deficits, have been ongoing for many
decades, but these approaches rely on trial-and-error and are highly nonspecific. In contrast, the strategy we
have developed, combining biologically realistic computational models with empirical approaches, enables us to
efficiently and systematically explore the molecular processes that underlie different types of long-term synaptic
plasticity, and predict individual training protocols to optimize learning and memory. Second, to our knowledge,
our groups are the first to develop a computational model describing the possible mechanism underlying infantile
learning and the apparent rapid forgetting associated with infantile amnesia. Our simulations suggest that altered
regulation of basal activities of kinases and transcription factors in infant animals contributes to fast forgetting of
infantile memory. Specific hypotheses to be tested by simulation and in vivo experiments include: Aim 1) LTF
and LTM for sensitization can be prolonged up to 7 days by novel computationally designed training protocols;
Aim 2) Computationally designed protocols based on the dynamics of amygdala kinases can enhance the
acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear memories; and Aim 3) The apparent rapid forgetting of infantile
memory observed in an inhibitory avoidance paradigm can be overcome by computationally designed protocols
based on the dynamics of hippocampal kinases. We believe that these predictions, combined with concurrent
empirical tests, will provide a proof of principle for an efficient strategy to enhance learning and improve memory
retrieval. Our study may have clinical relevance for interventions aiming at facilitating memory formation in a
series of psychiatric disorders associated with cognitive impairment in humans, as well as for improving
extinction-based therapies in patients suffering from anxiety-related disorders."

Sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth, inclusive of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer are more
likely to initiate vaping and currently vape than non-SGM youth in the United States. Vaping significantly
increases the risks of initiating cigarette smoking and poly-tobacco use, and consequently tobacco-related
illnesses. Higher prevalence of vaping among SGM youth will therefore widen tobacco-related health
disparities later in life. anti-vaping campaigns designed for the general youth population may not fully address
SGM youths' underlying beliefs and attitudes toward vaping. There is a critical gap in research on evidence-
based and culturally tailored interventions to reduce vaping initiation in the SGM youth population. Our long-
term goal is to reduce tobacco use and tobacco-related health disparities among SGM populations. The
objective of Project SMART (Social Media Anti-vaping Messages to Reduce ENDS Use Among Sexual and
Gender Minority Teens) is to evaluate the effectiveness of an SGM-tailored social media intervention to
prevent vaping initiation among SGM youth ages 13-18 years. Our central hypothesis is that culturally tailored
anti-vaping social media messages will be more effective than non-tailored messages to prevent vaping
initiation among SGM youth. The scientific premise for this work is based on the principles of cultural tailoring
in health communication for vulnerable populations, the Health Equity Promotion Model, and the Message
Impact Framework. We are developing and evaluating a social media intervention because SGM youth have a
high rate of social media use and are more likely to go online for health information than non-SGM youth.
Social media, moreover, are increasingly used for health promotion to address health disparities and well-
being of SGM populations. Our specific aims are: 1) Explore salient beliefs and cultural tailoring preferences
related to vaping initiation among SGM youth to inform the development of social media anti-vaping messages,
2) Identify promising anti-vaping messages and cultural tailoring strategies to reduce vaping initiation among
SGM youth, and 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of repeated exposure to SGM-tailored anti-vaping social media
messages on subsequent vaping initiation among SGM youth. We are developing and evaluating a culturally
tailored social media intervention using qualitative research methods and survey experiments. We will conduct
rapid-cycle feedback with stakeholders including SGM organization leaders to provide input on the message
design, testing, and intervention implementation to ensure feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.
Impact: Findings will provide evidence for the comparative effectiveness of an SGM-tailored anti-vaping social
media intervention to reduce vaping initiation among SGM youth versus non-tailored messages. The study
findings and approach will inform efforts to reduce disparities in vaping among SGM and other vulnerable
youth populations."

The food system is comprised of food production, access, and marketing. Public health efforts have been
increasingly focused on food systems given that poor diet is the number one risk factor for preventable disease
in the United States. American Indians (AIs) experience substantial diet-related health disparities: AI adults are
50% more likely to be obese, 30% more likely to have hypertension, and twice as likely to have diabetes
compared to Whites. In 2013, the Osage Nation in Oklahoma launched Bird Creek Farm (BCF) with the mission
to facilitate Indigenous food sovereignty, defined as the right and responsibility of Indigenous peoples to healthy
and culturally appropriate foods produced through traditional Indigenous practices. By 2015, BCF had 12
employees and began providing food to tribal programs. In the same year, in collaboration with BCF, our team
launched the NIMHD-funded FRESH farm-to-school program (R01MD011266). Preliminary findings from this
tribally-driven community-based participatory research (CBPR) study show an increase in vegetable and fruit
intake among children and adults and a decrease in food insecurity. Building upon our eight-year CBPR
partnership, the proposed study will implement a new community supported agriculture (CSA) program in which
Osage citizens will receive a weekly share of freshly grown farm produce for 6 months. CSAs have improved
diet and health in non-AI populations, and are evidence-based strategies recommended by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and the Institute of Medicine to reduce health disparities, but no randomized
controlled trial of a CSA program has been conducted in the AI population. Accordingly, we will test the efficacy
of a CSA program combined with culturally-tailored nutrition and cooking education on diet and health outcomes
among Osage adults, evaluate its cost-effectiveness, and develop a multimedia toolkit for disseminating findings.
Our specific aims are to: 1) Conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the newly developed CSA program’s
effect on diet, blood pressure, and blood lipids (primary outcomes) and on body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin
A1c (HbA1c), food insecurity, and health status (secondary outcomes) among 600 AI adults (aged 18-75) with
overweight/obesity; 2) Perform an economic evaluation for individual (e.g., health-related quality of life),
organizational (e.g., healthcare utilization costs), and community-level (e.g., prevention of cardiometabolic
diseases) outcomes; and 3) Document and disseminate study processes and findings using participatory video
methods, and compile a web-based toolkit for other AI communities to use CBPR to improve tribal food systems.
This study is the first to rigorously intervene across all components of the food system to address poor diet and
health among AIs. Building upon Osage Nation assets and priorities, guided by a CBPR and Indigenous food
sovereignty orientation, and based upon recommended strategies to eliminate disparities, study findings will
inform research and policy efforts to create sustainable food access in reservations with high rates of chronic
disease as well as urban AI communities where CSAs are available and could be tailored to AIs."

Autophagy is an essential cellular degradative pathway triggered by environmental stress in many cell types. In
neurons, autophagy has a further role as a constitutively active mechanism that maintains axonal homeostasis.
In vitro and in vivo, autophagosomes are generated de novo at axon terminals and synaptic sites. Once formed,
axonal autophagosomes are trafficked back to the soma by the retrograde microtubule motor protein cytoplasmic
dynein. Autophagosomes mature en route through fusion with late endosomes and lysosomes. Cargo
degradation also occurs during transport along the axon, leading to the somal delivery of digested contents for
recycling in new biosynthetic pathways. Axonal autophagy degrades mitochondrial fragments and disease-
associated protein aggregates, suggesting a key role in the maintenance of axonal homeostasis. Consistent with
this hypothesis, neuron-specific ablation of autophagy is sufficient to cause neurodegeneration. However, many
outstanding questions remain that must be addressed: How is autophagy regulated in neurons? What controls
the localization and timing of autophagosome formation and cargo engulfment? What is the function of axonal
autophagy – what cargos are targeted for degradation, and by what mechanisms? And how does the axonal
autophagy pathway intersect with the endolysosomal pathway to effectively degrade cargos such as
dysfunctional organelles and aggregated proteins? To address these questions, we will use live cell imaging in
primary neurons and gene-edited iPSC-derived human neurons, in concert with biochemical and biophysical
approaches including proteomic analysis and computational modeling, to query the basic mechanisms of axonal
autophagy and how these mechanisms are perturbed by neuronal stressors including mitochondrial dysfunction,
protein aggregation, and lysosomal damage. We will address the following specific aims: Aim 1: How is
autophagy spatially and temporally regulated in neurons? What controls the initiation of autophagy at the axon
terminal or presynaptic sites? Aim 2: What cargos are degraded by axonal autophagy? Is cargo engulfment a
selective process, or nonspecific? Is there preferential uptake of some cargos, and if so, what are these cargos?
What mechanisms control cargo uptake? And Aim 3: How does the autophagy pathway intersect with the
lysosomal pathway? How is autophagosome-lysosome fusion regulated? Why is axonal autophagy so
dependent on retrograde axonal transport? And what mechanisms regulate lysosomal health along the axon,
as lysosomes are required for the effective clearance of engulfed cargos by autophagy. Given the essential and
conserved role that autophagy plays in neurons, we anticipate that these studies will significantly advance our
understanding of neuronal cell biology, providing important insights into the mechanisms maintaining axonal.
homeostasis and how the perturbation of these mechanisms may lead to neurodegeneration. We hope that these
advances will provide new ideas on how to best intervene therapeutically to treat diseases such as ALS,
Huntington's, and Parkinson's disease."
10827897,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Understanding how a pathogenic mutation leads to disease is extremely important for prognosis, for
developing effective treatments and for assessing likely response to treatment. Genes do not act in isolation.
Gene mutations typically do not cause the disease pathology themselves - rather, they activate or deactivate
biological pathways, affecting a set of molecules whose function results in the manifestation and progression of
disease phenotypes. Furthermore, evidence from several groups including our preliminary omics studies
suggests that alterations in different sets of molecules may lead to multiple disease phenotypes, further adding
to the complexities underlying genetic mutations and their effects.
 The goal of this application is to delve into this complexity by looking closely at three different disease aspects
of the Mfrprd6 mutation, namely, photoreceptor degeneration, hyperopia and fundus spotting, and examine their
association with three intermediary phenotypes, aberrant DHA levels, cytoskeletal derangements and immune
cell responses. Our approach is to use clinical, functional and biochemical tests to provide a deep
characterization of the disease phenotypes and to examine associated cellular changes using single-nuclear
transcriptomics and proteomic analyses. These phenotypic and genomics data will be analyzed using
computational methods to identify the earliest perturbations in these models, and to determine in proof-of-
principle experiments, whether it is possible to manipulate the disease outcomes with nutriceutical and
pharmacological interventions. Successful completion of our studies will identify the pathogenic pathways that
result in observed disease phenotypes, due to the disruption of Mfrp function, revealing potential therapeutic
targets that may play a role in a broad range of retinal genetic diseases with similar phenotypic manifestations.

Despite decades of targeted research, no effective pharmacologic interventions have been identified for the
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which is a life-threatening disease process characterized by
dysregulated immune responses. Sepsis is a major cause of ARDS, and the pathophysiology of both
processes is characterized by alterations in microcirculatory blood flow, with vascular endothelial cell (EC)
dysfunction playing a major role in organ injury. Novel mechanistic insights are needed to assist the
development of therapies to address the EC barrier dysfunction that underlies ARDS and sepsis.
Staphylococcus (S.) aureus is a frequently identified organism in gram-positive sepsis, and the highly virulent,
antibiotic-resistant methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strain is particularly challenging to treat and a major
cause of ARDS. Important knowledge gaps exist both in MRSA-induced pathophysiology relevant to ARDS
and in the mechanistic understanding of EC-specific processes that can be targeted therapeutically.
Endogenous sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and the structurally similar pharmaceutical compound, FTY720
(FTY), have EC barrier-enhancing effects in preclinical models of ARDS. However, both S1P and FTY also
induce a myriad of other effects that are potentially harmful in critically ill patients and make them poor
therapeutic candidates. We therefore have explored the barrier-regulatory properties of novel FTY720 analogs
to better understand how these compounds regulate permeability. Our work has revealed that FTY720 (S)-
phosphonate (Tys) has superior efficacy in several preclinical models and maintains expression levels of the
essential S1PR1 receptor, unlike other agonists which induce its degradation. In addition, epigenetic processes
are increasingly being recognized as important pathogenic steps during inflammatory acute lung injury
(ALI)/ARDS and sepsis, and epigenetic responses (such as histone acetylation) can be altered by S1P-related
signaling. Our central hypothesis is that MRSA causes EC dysfunction relevant to ARDS by epigenetic and
other pathophysiologic mechanisms that can be targeted by Tys/S1PR1-related signaling. Using ChIP-seq
analysis and other epigenetic tools, we have generated new insights that MRSA triggers histone acetylation in
lung EC to regulate genes involved in lung EC dysfunction. Exciting new data suggest Tys-S1PR1 signaling
may ameliorate key aspects of these epigenetic effects. Aim #1 will determine the mechanisms by which
Tys/S1PR1 signaling protects against MRSA-induced lung EC barrier disruption in vitro. Aim #2 will use state-
of-the-art ChIP-seq and other approaches to characterize novel MRSA- and Tys/S1PR1-induced epigenetic
changes that have functional consequences in lung EC, including the novel MRSA target identified by our
epigenetic screening, CYP1A1. Aim #3 will extend these studies in vivo by characterizing epigenetic and other
mechanisms of MRSA-induced lung injury in mice and determine the efficacy of Tys. Overall, these studies will
advance our mechanistic understanding of MRSA-induced ARDS to identify novel therapeutic targets."

 Development of the central nervous system (CNS) requires precise intercellular ‘crosstalk’ between
neural cells and non-neural cells. Fibroblasts in the meninges are a non-neural cell that substantially influences
brain development, in large part via secreted factors that guide neuronal migration and neurogenesis. This is
underscored by significant defects in CNS development observed in mice and humans with mutations in FOXC1,
a transcription factor expressed by meningeal fibroblasts but not any neural cells. However much remains
unknown about how factors from the meninges activate or inhibit molecular signaling pathways in neural cells to
influence developmental processes. Filling these gaps in knowledge would significantly improve our
understanding of the homeostatic function of the meninges and the pathology that occurs in neurodevelopmental
disorders. Foxc1 mutants do not have normal meningeal fibroblasts over the forebrain, have increased apical
progenitor self-renewal and reduced neuron production leading to neocortical lengthening, linked in part to lack
of meninges derived retinoic acid. However, it is not known what aberrant signaling pathways in Foxc1 mutant
apical progenitors promote increased self-renewal and how this is connected to a reduction of meninges derived
factors like retinoic acid. The objective of this proposal is to investigate how meninges derived factors regulate
molecular signaling to control neurogenesis in the neocortex. Using spatial transcriptomics on embryonic Foxc1-
KO tissue sections, I have identified elevated Notch signaling, known to promote stem cell self-renewal, in Foxc1-
KO neocortical progenitors. In Aim 1, I will use global and targeted approaches to inhibit Notch signaling in
Foxc1-KO animals and test if this improves neocortical neurogenesis in these mutants. In Aim 2, I will test is
meningeal derived retinoic acid or other factors produced by the meninges modulate Notch signaling in
neocortical progenitors to promote neurogenesis. Results from this project will provide important insight into
molecular mechanisms for meninges-brain signaling required for normal development."

The goal of the University of Delaware Center of Biomedical Research Excellence in Cardiovascular Health is to
continue to support multidisciplinary research aimed toward understanding the mechanisms underlying the
causes and consequences of poor cardiovascular health and/or function, and developing effective interventions
for these conditions. During Phase I our COBRE Research Core acquired equipment and supported personnel
that was instrumental in the advancement of our project leaders to R01 funding. In addition to COBRE projects,
the core has also supported a number of other NIH funded projects through both access to equipment and
personnel. The COBRE Research Core includes a Cardiovascular Research Core (CVRC) that provides
instrumentation and personnel, biostatistical support, and bioimaging support through the Bio-Imaging Center.
The establishment of the CVRC in Phase I took advantage of the Cardiovascular Physiology Labs that had been
constructed at UD to facilitate cardiovascular research in the Health Sciences Complex. The core expanded its
footprint over the course of Phase I as the needs of investigators continued to grow. In Phase II the core will be
led by a new core director, will add personnel for the management of equipment and facilities, acquire additional
ultrasound imaging equipment and upgrade confocal microscopy capabilities in the Bio-imaging Center. The
proposed Phase II COBRE in Cardiovascular Health will capitalize on our success and momentum from Phase
I and the Research Core will continue to be the research hub of this COBRE accelerating the pace of
investigation in the center. The continued success and sustainability of the center depends on strengthening the
administrative framework and the infrastructure for the growing cardiovascular research at UD in order to support
project investigators and other investigators at UD."

Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer, enabling the generation of mutations and gross chromosomal
rearrangements to drive neoplastic cell transformation and oncogenesis. A variety of conserved DNA repair
mechanisms eliminate DNA damage, and defects in these DNA repair pathways lead to genomic instability and
cancer. Homologous recombination (HR) is one such DNA repair pathway, which mediates the accurate repair
of highly toxic double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) and damaged DNA replication forks. BRCA1 and its obligate
binding partner BARD1, both suppressors of breast, ovarian, and other cancers, fulfill multifaceted roles in HR.
Specifically, the BRCA1-BARD1 complex influences DSB repair pathway choice and enhances the efficiency of
several HR steps, including the nucleolytic processing of DNA lesions, the assembly of DSB repair nucleoprotein
complexes that harbor the recombinase RAD51, and DNA strand invasion. We posit that the DNA and RAD51
binding attributes of BRCA1-BARD1 are germane for the DSB repair and replication fork maintenance functions
of this tumor suppressor complex. To help fill major knowledge gaps, this fellowship proposal strives to delineate
RAD51 and DNA interaction interfaces in BRCA1-BARD1 and to elucidate the mechanistic roles of these
biochemical attributes in HR-mediated DNA repair and the protection of stressed and damaged DNA replication
forks. Our objectives will be accomplished through biochemical and cell-based studies under two specific aims.
The results of our endeavors will clarify the functional relevance of clinical mutations within BRCA1-BARD1
domains and create new avenues for the development of novel therapeutics to target tumors deficient in DNA
repair."

Although much progress has been made in the treatment and prevention of diarrheal illness over the last century,
the developing world is still plagued by diarrheal pathogens, with young children being particularly susceptible
to diarrhea-related deaths. The long-term goal is to better understand how the coordinated responses of both
immune and non-immune cells contribute to intestinal barrier protection during enteric infection. Our group
recently discovered that Th17/22 cells are uniquely charged with protection of the intestinal crypts from enteric
pathogens; however, the mechanisms by which these T cells are recruited to and sustain activation of crypt
intestinal epithelial cells (cIECs) are unknown. The overall objectives in this application are to (i) elucidate the
molecular mechanisms involved in recruiting T cells to cIECs and (ii) determine how recruited T cells interact
with cIECs to deliver protective IL-22 signals. The central hypothesis is that IFN–induced upregulation of IEC-
derived T cell-recruiting chemokines and MHCII expression promotes T cell recruitment to colonic crypts and
targets pathogen-specific T cell-derived IL-22 signals to cIECs, respectively. The rationale for this project is that
molecules involved in both recruitment and localized delivery of IL-22 to IECs will likely yield novel targets for
therapies in diarrheal illnesses and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), since responses to enteric pathogens and
etiology of IBD share overlapping immune mechanisms. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two
specific aims: 1) IFN signaling in Lgr5+ IECs is critical for recruiting host-protective Cxcr3+ Th1 and Th17/22
cells to the colonic crypts; and 2) pathogen-specific T cells protect intestinal crypts via MHCII-dependent,
sustained IL-22 delivery to IECs. The Citrobacter rodentium (C.r) model of infectious colitis, which closely models
human E. coli infections, will be used to test both aims in this proposal. In Aim I, mice with deletion of the IFNR1
in Lgr5+ IECs will be used to to test the hypothesis that IFN signaling in Lgr5+ IECs is required for upregulation
of T cell-recruiting chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl10 and adoptive transfer of Cxcr3-deficient T cells will be used to
determine if the Cxcl9/10-Cxcr3 axis is involved in recruiting CD4+ T cells to cIECs. In Aim II, mice deficient for
MHCII expression on IECs will be utilized to test the requirement of antigen presentation by IECs for IL-22-
mediated protection of the intestinal crypts. In addition, mice that report TCR stimulation and adoptive transfer
of C.r-specific T cells will be used to test the hypothesis that antigen-specific T cell–IEC interactions are important
for protection from C.r infection. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it utilizes a
newly engineered C.r strain to track antigen-specific T cells in the colon, and it offers unique insights into
previously unrecognized roles of Lgr5+ intestinal stem cells. The proposed research is significant because it is
expected to provide novel mechanisms by which T cells and IECs cooperate to protect the host from enteric
pathogens. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential for innovative therapies for infectious colitis and IBD."

 A major long-term goal of our laboratory is to delineate regulatory mechanisms that control adipocyte
development and systemic physiology. This proposal will address a new regulatory pathway involved in
adipocyte nutrient sensing, adipose tissue physiology, and adipose depot-specific energy expenditure. The
proposed studies are focused on understanding how dynamic regulation adipocyte membrane composition
contributes to the control of whole-body metabolic homeostasis in living animals. Preliminary data implicates
the phospholipid remodeling enzyme Lpcat3 as novel mechanistic link between dietary fatty acid intake,
adipose tissue homeostasis, and susceptibility to obesity. This proposal builds upon our preliminary
discoveries to address important questions regarding the relationship of membrane lipid composition to
adipose tissue function and systemic physiology and energy balance. We have previously shown that the
enzyme Lpcat3 is uniquely required for the incorporation of the 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids into
phospholipids. Our preliminary data reveal that adipose Lpcat3 expression is induced in the setting of cold
exposure or diet-induced obesity. Moreover, initial characterization of mice lacking Lpcat3 selectively in
adipose tissues has revealed two distinct phenotypes: one traced to white adipose tissue (WAT) and one
traced to brown adipose tissue (BAT). Adipose Lpcat3 KO mice fed a high-fat diet develop a lipodystrophic
phenotype are unable to appropriately expand their WAT, leading to ectopic hepatic lipid accumulation and the
compensatory upregulation of fatty acid oxidation in WAT. At the same time, BAT Lpcat3 KO mice show an
abnormal response to cold challenge, characterized by marked ER stress. A striking commonality between
these WAT and BAT KO models is the compensatory production of FGF21 in an apparent effort to maintain
energy homeostasis. We hypothesize that the fine tuning of adipose tissue membrane composition by Lpcat3
is a critical adaptive response to cold and dietary challenge that permits optimal lipid storage and catabolic
function in a range of environments. We will address these hypotheses with the following specific aims.
Specific Aim 1 is to elucidate the role of membrane phospholipid remodeling in nutrient sensing and healthy
adipose tissue expansion. Specific Aim 2 is to determine the role of phospholipid remodeling in BAT function
and response to thermal stress."

In 2015, we reported the discovery of the tetracycline destructases (TDases), a family of flavoenzymes capable
of inactivating tetracycline (Tet) antibiotics by enzymatic degradation, distinguishing them from canonical mech-
anisms of Tet resistance. Since that report we have expanded the pool of known TDases to >100 functionally
identified enzymes, reported crystal structures of numerous TDases, and proposed a class of small molecule
inhibitors to combat these enzymes. TDases are now widely recognized as a clinically-relevant resistance mech-
anism. The central motivation for this proposal is to better understand the molecular mechanisms, evolutionary
origins, and structural features of TDases in order to rationally design better diagnostics and inhibitors to restore
efficacy of a vital class of antibiotics as TDases continue to disseminate and become a widespread cause of
morbidity and mortality. Our collaborative effort has yielded impactful scientific results, and we are ideally
equipped to carry out our three independent yet complementary specific aims: 1) Elucidate the mechanism of
Tet inactivation by the TDases, 2) Understand the evolution of TDases at genetic and population levels, and 3)
Develop inhibitors and diagnostic agents for TDases. The first aim will test the hypothesis that diverse sub-
strate-binding modes and FAD cofactor orientations determine the atomic site of Tet oxidation and reg-
ulate the catalytic cycle of the TDases. We propose that we can correlate observed enzymatic degradation
products with respective binding modes using X-ray crystallography, photoaffinity crosslinking, enzyme kinetics,
and isotopic labeling studies with a variety of TDases and substrates. The second aim examines the sequence
determinants of flavin monooxygenase evolution toward Tet inactivation as well as the selective ad-
vantage that TDases provide in the context of bacterial populations expressing different mechanisms of
Tet resistance. We will identify novel enzymes through iterative sequence-based predictions and phenotypic
validation, identify structural elements required for activity using saturation mutagenesis and DNA shuffling, and
examine the population-level fitness advantages of TDases using high-throughput reporter assays. The third
aim will determine whether anhydrotetracycline (aTC) analogs can be optimized to inhibit TDases by
controlling ligand binding mode and whether chromogenic Tets can serve as diagnostic agents for
TDase expression in pathogens. We will use robust semi-synthetic methods developed by us for modification
of the Tet and aTC scaffolds and study the resulting novel compounds with rigorous biochemical assays, X-ray
crystallography, and phenotypic whole-cell studies. The proposed research is significant because antibiotic re-
sistance is a public health crisis, and TDases that degrade all known tetracyclines are widely distributed in di-
verse environmental and pathogenic bacteria. The proposed research is impactful because it combines funda-
mental understanding of enzyme evolution and mechanism with the development of co-therapeutic and diag-
nostic agents that have the potential to mitigate the emerging threat posed by enzymatic Tet inactivation."

development) or the granulosa cell lineage (leading to ovary development). Commitment to Sertoli or
granulosa fate is characterized by the loss of repressive histone marks at genes associated with the active
pathway, and expansion of repressive marks at genes associated with the alternative pathway. Repression,
which we hypothesize is mediated in part by chromatin conformational changes, is important to stabilize fate
commitment. However, how epigenetic modifications and transcription factor cascades are integrated to drive
sex determination is not understood. It is well established that the key step in activating Sertoli cell
differentiation is the transient activation of the Y-encoded transcription factor (TF), SRY, and its direct
downstream target, SOX9. However, since our discovery that supporting cells are derived from the coelomic
epithelium (CE), it has been unclear why Sry and female pathway genes are only activated in cells once they
leave the CE and enter the gonad. We recently showed that NUMB, an inhibitor of the Notch signaling
pathway, is asymmetrically distributed to cells that enter the gonad from the CE and is required for gonadal
cell differentiation. These findings imply that a factor(s) activated in Numb+/Notchlo cells confers competence
for differentiation. Exploration of our transcriptome, ATAC-seq, and histone modification datasets, revealed
that 2 E-box family HLH transcription factors, Tcf4 and Tcf12, are expressed at high levels in the bipotential
gonad, remain highly expressed in the granulosa lineage, but are downregulated in the Sertoli lineage where
they map as binding targets of SOX9 and could be targets of feedback repression to block the granulosa
pathway in XY gonads. E-box binding motifs are enriched in the nucleosome-depleted regions near granulosa
genes but are absent from Sertoli genes, with the exception of Sry itself. Our findings suggest that TCF4 and
TCF12, activated in Numb+/Notchlo cells, license differentiation of the supporting cell lineage, serving as
activators of the granulosa pathway and of Sry in the XY gonad; whereas, SOX9, activated by SRY, acts in a
feedback loop to down-regulate Tcf4 and Tcf12 transcription. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that bHLH
TFs are downstream of Numb, comprise an HLH “code” for differentiation of the supporting cell lineage, and
are repressed by SOX9. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that epigenetic and chromatin conformation
changes occur during Sertoli fate commitment, mediated in part by competition between SOX9 and HLH
proteins, and function to stabilize the male pathway by modulating accessibility of promoters and enhancers
and the expansion of silencing marks at genes associated with the alternative granulosa pathway."
10834984,"Obesity is a widespread and growing health problem the United States, associated with metabolic disorders, including diabetes. Major efforts have been made to mitigate obesity through diet control, exercise or appetite suppression. These methods have been met with limited success and high rates of rebound, urging the development of new strategies. Thermogenic beige adipocytes have attracted considerable attention as a new therapeutic target due to their potent anti-obesity activity in adult humans. Unlike classical brown adipocytes that retain a stable cellular identity, beige adipocytes have a unique cellular plasticity, capable of completely interconverting between brown and white adipocyte states via significant epigenomic reprogramming. The extraordinary plastic nature of beige adipocyte cellular identity and its underlying molecular mechanisms have yet to be well understood. Our recent studies led to a striking finding defining the ‘dedifferentiation’ potential of beige adipocytes. We found that upon cold exposure, a subpopulation of whitened beige adipocytes (beige adipocytes turned to white adipocytes), dedifferentiated into progenitor-like cells, proliferated, and possibly redifferentiated into thermogenic adipocytes. This reprogramming process serves as a potential novel mechanism of beige adipocyte recruitment. Our epigenomic analysis identified NFIL3 (Nuclear Factor, Interleukin 3 Regulated) as a key transcription factor, potentially mediating cold-induced beige adipocyte reprogramming. NFIL3 expression was induced by cold exposure, specifically in beige but not in brown adipocytes, and located in dedifferentiating beige adipocytes. Furthermore, both in vitro cell culture and in vivo mouse models deficient with NFIL3 in adipocytes demonstrated that NFIL3 is necessary for adipose tissue browning during cold exposure. In addition, NFIL3 loss in adipocytes resulted in increased susceptibility to diet- induced obesity after high fat diet feeding. Based on these data, we hypothesize that NFIL3 is a key transcription factor that controls beige adipocyte plasticity by mediating the transition from white to brown adipocytes, thereby regulating energy balance and glucose homeostasis. In aim 1, we will elucidate whitened beige adipocyte reprogramming during browning and a role for NFIL3. We will perform beige adipocyte pulse- chase experiments in NFIL3 knockout (KO) mice using microscopy, single nuclei RNA-seq and cell culture. In aim 2, we will determine the role of NFIL3 in cold tolerance and glucose homeostasis by conducting comprehensive physiology studies with adipocyte-specific NFIL3 KO mice. In aim 3, we will identify molecular mechanisms by which NFIL3 regulates adipocyte identity by using ChIP-seq to define the NFIL3 cistrome in beige adipocytes. These studies will uncover novel aspects of beige adipocyte cellular plasticity. We will establish the role of NFIL3 as a new regulator of beige adipocyte reprogramming, systemic energy balance and nutrient homeostasis. Therefore, the successful completion of these studies will lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches for obesity, and other co-morbid metabolic diseases."
10795921,"Abstract
 This proposal is submitted in response to RFA-MH-18-707 and NOT-MH-20-027, and aims to conduct a
randomized, double-blind, controlled confirmatory efficacy trial of a novel, neuroplasticity-based computerized
cognitive remediation (nCCR) intervention for treatment resistant late-life major depressive disorder (LLD). We
developed nCCR to target cognitive control deficits (CCD), a behavioral expression of altered function of the
Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)-defined, cognitive control network (CCN). This novel intervention is
consistent with NIMH priorities to advance interventions informed by cognitive and affective neuroscience
(strategy 3.1) that can be disseminated to the community (strategy 3.3). In LLD, deficits in cognitive control
functions (CCD) are common, and disabling. We and others have documented that specific CCD, and their
underlying brain network abnormalities, are associated with poor response to antidepressants, relapse, and
increased risk for suicide. These deficits are mediated by the CCN, a frontoparietal circuit that comprises the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, and posterior parietal cortex, as well as
projections to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and subcortical structures, including the striatum.
 The theory guiding neuroplasticity-based cognitive interventions is that network abnormalities associated
with negative disease-specific clinical outcomes can be altered through the induction of neuroplasticity (even in
the aging brain), resulting in enhanced functioning of the target network, and symptomatic improvements. The
methodology we employed is founded in basic animal science of induction of plasticity in the aging brain, and
it is translated into computer algorithms that deliver (1) increasingly challenging; (2) dynamic difficulty adjusted;
(3) attention demanding; and (4) immediately rewarding cognitive training designed to activate CCD associated
with poor clinical outcomes. We recently tested nCCR in three preliminary clinical trials.
 Our preliminary data indicate that nCCR will likely engage our proposed target, CCD. Further, nCCR
appears to have more robust mood effects in participants who have pronounced CCD, while SSRI/SNRI-
treated patients are two times less likely to benefit. We designed nCCR to be: short (4-week dose), efficacious,
mobile (available via web), cost-effective (does not require an MD/PhD), with the potential for wide distribution,
easy adoptability, and extensibility to address this urgent, unmet therapeutic need in LLD. For these patients
there is currently no treatment that adequately addresses both mood and cognitive impairment. The data
produced by this proposal will allow us to study the relationship between CCD and changes in mood, and
compare these effects to a control condition in LLD participants who have failed first-line treatments. Further,
we propose a two-site, sufficiently powered trial to study our technology-facilitated parameters, as well as
implementation procedures in two large medical systems, which have great potential to inform future
interventions of this type and support scalability of mobile nCCR into “usual care” settings."

This is a competitive renewal application for continued support of the Rutgers Summer Undergraduate
Research Fellowship (SURF) program. The SURF program provides undergraduates with 10-week basic
science and translational hands-on research experiences in environmental health sciences, along with weekly
networking and career activities. In this renewal application, funds are requested to support fellowships for 12
students. Students are admitted to the SURF program after review of scholastic achievement, letters of
recommendation, and personal statements. Recruitment strategies are in place to continue to attract students
from disadvantaged and underrepresented backgrounds. Under the mentorship of NIH-funded Rutgers faculty,
SURF students conduct hands-on research projects focused on environmental health sciences, and participate
in an innovative team-based field study that involves sampling and analysis of an environmental site with
potential contamination. Students meet with mentors weekly to receive one-on-one training, ensure continued
development of research skills, and evaluate progress of scientific projects. The SURF program draws upon
the resources, infrastructure, and expertise of faculty who are members of the Environmental and Occupational
Health Sciences Institute, and part of our NIEHS T32 Toxicology predoctoral and postdoctoral training grant
and NIEHS P30 Center for Environmental Exposures and Disease at Rutgers University Ernest Mario School
of Pharmacy, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, and School of Public Health. Students also participate in
weekly seminars and workshops on topics of career development, responsible conduct of research training,
laboratory safety training, and environmental research. They also tour core facilities established as part of our
NIEHS Center and are instructed in state-of-the-art technology for biomedical research. The summer program
culminates in the preparation of oral presentations and abstracts (written and graphical) that describe key
research findings. The SURF Program Directors have an extensive evaluation plan to ensure the continued
development of the fellowship program and dissemination of innovative training approaches and successful
metrics. During the prior funding period, R25-funded trainees have had outstanding outcomes including
numerous national awards, co-authorship on peer-reviewed publications, and matriculation into professional
and graduate programs in toxicology. Renewal of this R25 application will provide an opportunity for Rutgers
faculty to continue to train the next generation of toxicologists and environmental health scientists."
10830296,"A small number of Rho family GTPases participate in a broad array of fundamental cellular behaviors.
Specificity is possible due to spatial and temporal control of GTPase “activation”; Guanine exchange factors
(GEFs) generate activated, GTP-bound GTPases with precise timing and localization, while specialized
interactions with adhesion molecules, membrane domains and other localized structures specify GEF-GTPase
interactions. GEF/GTPase circuits are complex, with localized feedbacks, multiple GEFs controlling one
GTPase, and vice versa. To dissect this spatiotemporally regulated circuitry requires imaging, and new
analytical techniques that can dissect causal relationships from imaging data. Following the intentions of PAR-
19-158 (Bioengineering Research Grants), we propose a multidisciplinary collaboration leveraging organic
chemistry, protein engineering, imaging, and computer science to fudnamentally advance signal transduction
imaging and analysis. As a biological testbed we will explore the role of GEF-GTPase interactions in cell
protrusion, single cell migration and collective migration. We will develop a generalizable approach to GEF
biosensors, and adapt our proven GTPase biosensors to image GEF and GTPase activities in the same cell.
Because GEF-GTPase interactions are heterogeneous and complex, multiplexed imaging is necessary to
quantify their relative dynamics. However, perturbation of cell behavior is especially problematic when using
two biosensors in the same cell. We will therefore develop new biosensor designs that greatly reduce cell
perturbation. Even the most precise imaging of overlapping molecular activations has not revealed causal
relationships. We will therefore adopt the framework of Granger Causality inference, which was originally
devised for financial market analysis, to extract causal connections and feedback interactions from imaging
data. Numerous steps will be necessary to translate the existing concepts of Granger causality to the analysis
of spatially and temporally distributed molecular processes. Most importantly, we will implement a schema for
Granger causality inference in multivariate time series models that will capture spatial relations, and we will
combine principles of high-dimensional statistical regression with approaches from control theory to estimate
information flows between variables that are coupled by strong feedbacks. We will also develop a novel
clustering approach that preserves the neighborhood topology of data in a high-dimensional feature space and
in the Euclidian space of the cell outline to identify signaling microdomains. Finally, to test and confirm our
hypotheses, we will use new photo-activatable and photo-inhibitable analogs of GEFs together with GTPase
biosensors to control one protein while observing another. This research plan will produce biosensors with
reduced perturbation, biosensor/optogenetic multiplexing capabilities, and image analysis/modeling
approaches necessary to shed light on the network topology of nonlinear, spatiotemporally controlled signaling
pathways. All tools will efficiently deployed to the community."
10829811,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Circadian clocks are believed to exist at almost all levels of life and play a fundamental role in
maintenance of physiological and behavioral processes in accordance with the day-night cycle. The
conventional model that describes the circadian clockwork at the molecular level revolves around
transcriptional/translational feedback loops (TTFLs). In these models, BMAL1 is believed to act as an
indispensable component of the timekeeping system. However, we have found pervasive molecular
oscillations in the transcriptome and proteome of Bmal1-/- mice. A research program will be undertaken
to obtain a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of these “non-canonical” circadian rhythms in
Bmal1-/- mice. The project will broadly focus on understanding transcriptional (Aim 1) and post-
transcriptional (Aim 2) functioning of cells and tissues from Bmal1-/- mice. (Aim1) Our preliminary data
suggest that the novel circadian rhythms we see might be underpinned by the recruitment of ETS family
transcription factors into the clockwork. We will functionally test their role by knocking out key ETS
proteins using CRISPR. We will also perform ChIP-seq experiments to find genomic targets driving
rhythmic transcripts that we see. In addition, we will perform nuclear proteomics to elucidate novel
transcription factors that might mediate rhythmic transcription. Furthermore, we will perform protein
interaction analyses using immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry to determine how ETS proteins and
redox proteins may physically interact. (Aim 2) We found redox oscillations in Bmal1 knockout cells,
implying that these play a role in the clockwork of Bmal1-/- mice. Consequently, we will investigate novel
redox oscillations in Bmal1 knockout cells using a novel redox proteomics workflow that we have
developed. In addition, we will characterize the rhythmic phospho-proteome and kinome of cells, which
we have found could be profoundly affected by deletion of Bmal1. Finally, we will determine whether
metabolic circadian oscillations occur in Bmal1 knockouts. Gaining new molecular insights into the
circadian clockwork will guide future therapeutic interventions to alleviate the disorders associated with
circadian disruption, which are highly prevalent in contemporary society."

10856900,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The broad long-term goal of this proposal is to establish the enzyme glutaminase-1 (GLS1) as a critical
mediator of lesion formation in arterial injury and disease. GLS1 is a mitochondrial enzyme that metabolizes
glutamine (Gln) to glutamate (Glu) and ammonia (NH3). GLS1 plays a critical role in neurotransmission, acid-
base balance, angiogenesis, hepatic fibrosis, and tumor growth, but little is known regarding the function of
GLS1 in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). However, preliminary studies demonstrated that the
proliferation, migration, and survival of SMCs is highly dependent on the presence of Gln. It was also
discovered that SMCs exclusively express the GLS1 isoform, that overexpression of GLS1 stimulates SMC
migration, and that inhibition of GLS1 activity or expression blocks SMC DNA synthesis or migration,
respectively. Moreover, Glu, but not NH3, substitutes for Gln in promoting SMC proliferation and collagen
synthesis. Additional experiments revealed that growth factors and glucose stimulate GLS1 activity in vascular
SMCs. Final pilot experiments also demonstrated that arterial injury and diabetes induces the expression of
GLS1 in the vessel wall, and that inhibition of GLS1 activity or genetic depletion of GLS1 attenuates neointima
formation following arterial injury as well as arterial fibrosis and stiffening in diabetic animals. Based on these
findings, it is proposed that GLS1 plays an integral role in aberrant arterial remodeling by stimulating SMC
proliferation, migration, collagen synthesis, and survival by metabolizing Gln to Glu and NH3. This hypothesis
will be tested in three interrelated specific aims. In aim 1, the role of GLS1 in regulating SMC function will be
determined. These studies will investigate the effect of GLS1 gene delivery on SMC proliferation, migration,
collagen synthesis and survival, and determine the role of the various GLS1 products on these processes.
They will also explore if the induction of GLS1 by growth factors contributes to their ability to promote SMC
proliferation, migration, and collagen synthesis. In aim 2, the role of GLS1 in regulating the arterial response
to injury will be established. These studies will examine the time-course of GLS1 expression in injured rodent
carotid arteries, and determine if pharmacological inhibition of GLS1 activity, silencing GLS1 expression, or
genetic deletion of GLS1 in SMCs attenuates the remodeling response following arterial injury. In aim 3, the
role of GLS1 in aberrant arterial remodeling and hypertension in diabetes will be investigated. These studies
will examine the effect of glucose on GLS1 expression both in cultured vascular SMCs and in arteries from
diabetic mice. In addition, they will examine if GLS1 contributes to glucose-mediated alterations in SMC
function, arterial remodeling, and hypertension in diabetic mice. It is anticipated that these studies will
establish GLS1 as a key regulator of SMC proliferation, migration, collagen synthesis, and survival. They may
also also identify GLS1 and its products as novel contributors to lesion formation following arterial injury, and
establish GLS1 as a new translational target in treating abnormal remodeling and hypertension in diabetes."

10843295,"Summary
Anxiety disorders, which onset during childhood or adolescence, often persist into adulthood, and increase the
risk of depression and suicide. Early adolescence, with the onset of puberty, is an important period for the
development and/or exacerbation of anxiety symptoms – i.e., Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Social
Anxiety Disorder (SAD) – with higher levels of symptoms in girls than boys. During this time, fronto-amygdala
circuitry, which supports emotion regulation, undergoes important maturational changes. Although alterations in
this circuitry has been reported in anxiety disorders, the neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying the sex
differences in levels of anxiety symptoms remain poorly understood. Compared to non-anxious youth, anxious
youth exhibit greater amygdala activation and reduced fronto-amygdala functional connectivity when processing
threat-related stimuli. Such reduced top–down modulation of amygdala activity to threat has been linked in
anxious adults to elevated concentrations in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate in the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and amygdala, respectively. It has also been linked, including in anxious youth, to
reduced integrity of white matter tracts connecting vmPFC and amygdala (i.e., uncinate fasciculus and cingulum).
While vmPFC inhibition of amygdala activity increases with age, we and others have shown in healthy and at-
risk youth that increases in pubertal hormones, particularly testosterone, are associated with reduced vmPFC-
amygdala functional connectivity to threat. We will test the model that increases in pubertal hormones during
early adolescence will exacerbate alterations in fronto-amygdala circuitry in anxious youth and contribute to
greater threat reactivity and increases in anxiety symptoms, especially in girls. We test this hypothesis in a
sample of medication-free 140 adolescents (50% female), varying in levels of anxiety, with 2/3 oversampled for
clinical levels of GAD and SAD symptoms. We will repeatedly assess participants at five timepoints. At baseline
and approximately 2 years later, we will assess anxiety (clinical interviews, questionnaires), pubertal status
(Tanner, self-report), pubertal hormones (DHEA, testosterone, and estradiol), threat reactivity in a real-world
context with physiological and subjective measures of threat reactivity, and neural indices of vmPFC-amygdala
circuitry (fMRI during threat processing and at rest, white matter connectivity, and magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (MRS) measures of GABA and glutamate). Change in symptoms will be assessed bi-annually via
online questionnaires over 2 years post baseline visit. We use an ultra high-field MRI at 7 Tesla, which will yield
unprecedented characterization of vmPFC-amygdala neurodevelopment in anxious youth. We will also explore
the effects of pubertal hormones, anxiety, and threat reactivity on whole brain functional networks and examine
how each of the neural indices relate to each other over time. Our goals are consistent with the RDoC initiative
and NIMH Strategy 2.2, encouraging identification of early biological and environmental risk and protective
factors and their underlying mechanisms to inform the continued development of prevention and intervention."

 This proposal presents a five-year research career development program focused on targeting donor liver-
resident cells with regulatory properties to decrease rejection after transplantation. I am an Assistant Professor
of Surgery at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, with previous research and clinical experience in transplant
immunology and transplant surgery involving normothermic ex vivo machine perfusion (NEVLP), whereby an
organ is housed under physiologic conditions. The present project will advance the field of transplant
immunology by using NEVLP technology to modify the immune cells within the liver prior to transplantation. I
have assembled an outstanding mentorship team of investigators with expertise in transplant immunology,
dendritic cell biology, and extracellular vesicle biology. The proposed training will guide and enhance my
development in core competencies, including transplant immunology, communication, biostatistics, and ethical
research design that will enable me to transition to research independence as a surgeon-scientist dedicated to
reducing organ rejection in the field of transplant surgery.
 Liver transplantation is the only treatment option for patients with end-stage liver disease; however,
rejection of the transplant can decrease liver and patient survival. In addition, patients still require lifelong use
of anti-rejection medications that suppress the immune system. Modification of the donor liver, and the immune
cells within it, has the potential to promote acceptance of the liver and minimize the need for anti-rejection
drugs. Advances in an innovative technique called normothermic ex vivo liver perfusion (NEVLP) offer a unique
opportunity to benefit significantly the 25% of liver transplant recipients that develop acute rejection, as well as
many more transplant recipients who would benefit from using fewer anti-rejection drugs. Recent studies have
demonstrated the importance of regulatory dendritic cells (DCregs) for prolonging transplant survival. My
central hypothesis is that expansion of the number of liver-resident DCregs during NEVLP will promote a
regulatory environment for the organ after transplant. Using a rat model of NEVLP and liver transplantation that
my research group has optimized, I expect NEVLP to expand DCregs potently, leading to an increase in
immune checkpoint molecule expression and production of anti-inflammatory extracellular vesicles and
cytokines that can reduce immune-mediated rejection. This innovative approach of expanding graft-resident
DCregs to decrease rejection could be used in deceased donor liver transplantation as well as translated to
other types of solid organ transplants. To achieve these objectives, I propose the following scientific aims:
1) Determine the dominant regulatory function of liver-resident DCregs after NEVLP, and 2) Measure the
impact of expanded liver-resident DCregs generated by combination cytokine therapy during NEVLP on liver
graft rejection in vitro and in vivo."
10861848,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Chronic pressure overload that leads to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and adverse cardiac remodeling
is one of the leading causes of heart failure and affects millions of Americans. In addition to pathological
insults and biomechanical factors, neurohormonal pathways that involve coordinated signaling through β1 and
β2 adrenergic receptors (ARs) can play a major role in myocardial adaptation to pressure overload. The factors
that shift the myocardial response to pressure overload from adaptive to maladaptive LVH remain largely
obscure. Our research has focused on the regulation of βAR trafficking and signaling by
ubiquitination/deubiquitination mechanisms. We recently discovered that differential regulation of β1AR and
β2AR endocytic trafficking can be achieved by the deubiquitinase (DUB) called ubiquitin-specific protease-20
(USP20), which we found deubiquitinates both βARs. In response to the βAR agonist (-)isoproterenol (Iso),
USP20 is phosphorylated on Ser333 by protein kinase A (PKA); this phosphorylation inhibits USP20 DUB
activity toward the β2AR and regulates trafficking of the β2AR to autophagosomes. USP20 phosphorylation
occurs in vivo, as well: (1) USP20 phosphorylation is significantly elevated in failing human hearts when
compared with non-failing hearts and (2) pressure overload achieved by transverse aortic constriction (TAC)
triggers USP20 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes of WT, but not β1AR KO mice. Accordingly, during LVH,
USP20 phosphorylation requires β1AR activation in the heart and may play a role in pathologic remodeling in
LVH and/or heart failure. We hypothesize that “USP20 and its phosphorylation status fine-tune βAR
signal transduction, endocytic trafficking and autophagy, thus impacting cardiac remodeling in LVH.”
We will test our hypotheses by addressing the following specific aims: (1) To determine the role of
cardiomyocyte-USP20 in the development of cardiac dysfunction, (2) To determine the regulation of
myocardial βAR signaling by USP20 Ser333 phosphorylation and (3) To determine the coordinated
roles of β1AR and USP20 in regulating ubiquitination status of the autophagy protein Beclin1 and its
effect in cardiomyocyte autophagy."

HIV drug resistance may compromise the UNAIDS 90-90-90 treatment goals and is a major hurdle to
sustainable antiretroviral therapy success. Though resistance testing is recommended by guidelines for patient
care in developed countries, there are existing research gaps in its understanding; genotypic-phenotypic
correlations in diverse HIV-1 subtypes, the relationship between minority drug resistance variants and
treatment outcomes, and reasons for discordances between genotype and treatment success or failure remain
unclear. These research gaps are of particular concern in resource-limited settings, where limited medications
and sub-optimal monitoring are common; and in children and adolescents, a vulnerable population with the
need for life-long therapy, who have higher levels of HIV-1 RNA, a wider treatment gap with fewer on therapy,
lower rates of suppression, limited formulations and more non-adherence. The long-term goal of our research
team is to provide new evidence to improve the clinical disease management children and adolescents living
with HIV in resource-limited settings. The purpose of this proposal is to address existing drug resistance
research gaps in a previously established, carefully characterized cohort of 499 children and adolescents living
with HIV in Kenya. To do this, we will use our successful collaboration with the Academic Model Providing
Access to Healthcare (AMPATH) in Kenya, one of the largest HIV programs in sub-Saharan Africa, and
uniquely leverage existing resources from our ongoing R01 AI120792 on perinatally-infected children and
adolescents at AMPATH (MPI Kantor and Vreeman). We hypothesize that comprehensive investigations of
genotypic-phenotypic and resistance-treatment outcome discordances in diverse non-B subtypes will resolve
some of these existing research gaps and optimize patient care in settings where it is most needed. We will
address this hypothesis with the following Aims: (1) Investigate genotype-phenotype correlations; (2) Evaluate
etiologies for treatment failure in the presence of a ‘susceptible genotype’; and (3) Evaluate etiologies for
treatment success in the presence of a ‘resistant genotype’. To achieve these aims, we will use already
available samples (collected between 2016-2018) from the existing cohort of Kenyan children and adolescents
living with non-B subtypes (Aim 1); longitudinally follow the cohort for four years (Aims 2 and 3); collect blood
samples bi-annually and assess adherence; identify participants that are eligible for proposed additional
investigations; conduct in vitro phenotyping to examine genotypic-phenotypic correlations; and perform near
full-length next generation sequencing on RNA and DNA to investigate minority resistance variants and
alternative mechanisms of resistance. The proposal is innovative in the uniqueness of the cohort studied, the
comprehensive proposed scientific investigations, and study design and evaluation of discordant genotype-
treatment outcomes scenarios. These investigations and directly addressing the existing knowledge gaps in
HIV-1 drug resistance in a particularly-vulnerable population with diverse non-B subtypes, will have a high
impact on improving treatment outcomes in children, adolescents, and adults living with HIV."

into one administrative entity. Additionally, we will partner with service cores of other local COBREs and those
at Brown-affiliated hospitals to broaden our service outreach. Our vision is that by sustaining and transitioning
the established research infrastructure into an integrated entity, we will enable neuroscientists to conduct their
work more effectively and efficiently."

 Von Willebrand factor (VWF) has two major roles in blood. One is to facilitate platelet adhesion and
aggregation, in which a critical step is to activate the VWF A1 domain to bind with platelet protein GPIbα under
flow. The other is to protect coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) from degradation, which is important for fibrin clot
formation. Mutations in VWF interfering with these binding interactions can cause thrombosis or von Willebrand
disease. The goal of this project is to determine molecular mechanisms governing the interactions between VWF
and its binding partners GPIbα and FVIII.
 Several questions regarding VWF interactions with GPIbα and FVIII persist. There has not been a
consistent model for how VWF A1 domain is activated to bind with GPIbα. It still remains unclear which and how
conformational changes actually happen during A1 activation. To date, the interaction between VWF multimer
and FVIII has been studied primarily using bulk VWF preparations. How FVIII binds to individual VWF multimers
is unknown. In intravenous infusion treatment for bleeding disorders, more free FVIII in the infusion is linked to
higher risk of FVIII immunogenicity, but the mechanisms remain unclear.
 In this project, we will combine single molecule biophysics and super resolution imaging methods to study
the following aims. (1) Understand flow-induced activation of VWF A1 binding with GPIbα. (2) Dissect the VWF-
FVIII binding mode and its role in protecting FVIII in blood. This study will provide direct evidence for the
mechanisms of how VWF binds with GPIbα and FVIII, and provide new insights into therapeutic development to
treat thrombotic or bleeding disorders."
10851956,"This is a competitive renewal of a stakeholder-engaged study across 28 college campuses focused on tailored
harm reduction interventions to reduce risk for sexual violence (SV) among undergraduate college students
receiving care from college health and counseling centers (CHCs). “Reducing Alcohol Involved Sexual vio-
lence in higher Education (RAISE)” is a longitudinal study that builds on a previous cluster-randomized con-
trolled trial on college campuses in Pennsylvania and West Virginia (R01 AA023260). We aim to reach stu-
dents at elevated risk for SV and hazardous drinking: students with history of SV, students who identify as sex-
ual/gender minority, and students who have disabilities (65% of our previous sample). SV, particularly alcohol-
involved SV, remains highly prevalent on college campuses. Our previous study found that a large proportion
of students seeking care in CHCs have experienced SV victimization (n=2291, 64% of women, 32% of men
report lifetime SV) which is associated with binge drinking. Students identifying as sexual or gender minority or
endorsing a disability (i.e., physical, emotional, sensory, neurologic, and learning impairments) report particu-
larly high lifetime prevalence of SV that is associated with greater odds of binge drinking compared to students
not exposed to SV. The previous RCT involved training CHC staff to deliver a brief educational intervention to
reduce SV risk, titled “Giving Information for Trauma Support and Safety” (GIFTSS), to all students seeking
care. Implementation varied across CHCs. Among students who received GIFTSS as intended, we found sig-
nificant increases in self-efficacy to use harm reduction strategies and SV-related services. Students with his-
tory of SV had greater than four-fold increase in odds of disclosing this history to providers. We identified pro-
vider-, clinic-and campus-level changes needed to improve intervention delivery. To more directly target use of
harm reduction strategies among students at elevated risk for SV and hazardous drinking, we also propose to
integrate a safety decision aid (myPlan app for use on smartphone or computer) which increases harm reduc-
tion behaviors among college women experiencing partner violence. The focus of this renewal is to 1) test
strategies to improve implementation of GIFTSS, 2) offer support for students at elevated risk for SV and haz-
ardous drinking with tailored harm reduction strategies delivered via the myPlan app after the clinic visit, and 3)
strengthen campus policies to promote access to SV services and reduce hazardous drinking. A 2x2 cluster
randomized controlled trial will compare two implementation strategies for GIFTSS in CHCs (provider scripts
vs. learning collaborative) focusing on undergraduate students ages 18-24 (N= 2400 across 28 campuses)
with follow-up at 4 months and 12 months (Aim 1). We will evaluate the effectiveness of myPlan in increasing
uptake of tailored harm reduction strategies for those at elevated risk for SV and hazardous drinking (Aim 2).
Finally, we will assess for alcohol and SV policy changes on each campus that may increase access to and
uptake of confidential services among students at elevated risk for hazardous drinking and SV (Aim 3)."

The basal ganglia are a group of subcortical nuclei that regulates motor and cognitive functions. Recent
identification of neuronal heterogeneity in the basal ganglia suggests that functionally distinct neural circuits
defined by their molecular identity and efferent projections exist even within the same nuclei. This distinction
may account for a multitude of symptoms associated with basal ganglia disorders such as Parkinson's disease
(PD). However, our incomplete understanding of the basal ganglia functional organization has hindered further
investigation of individual circuits that may underlie distinct behavioral symptoms in different disease states.
The external globus pallidus (GPe) is a central basal ganglia nucleus that can influence numerous downstream
regions. While the prevailing circuit model assumes that the GPe is a homogeneous population of neurons
transferring the signal in the indirect pathway of the basal ganglia, accumulating evidence suggests that neurons
in the GPe are more heterogeneous than previously appreciated. Although GPe is known to be a nucleus with
GABAergic neurons, we have identified novel cell types expressing VGLUT2, glutamatergic neuronal marker, at
the outer layer of GPe. In our careful anatomical and molecular examination showed that VGLUT2GPe neurons
project mainly to inner part of GPe, making synaptic contacts onto other neuronal populations. Recent evidence
showed that the distinct cell types in GPe may have different roles in modulating basal ganglia circuitry and
associated behaviors. Thus, elucidating the anatomical and functional organization of VGLUT2GPe neurons will
provide novel cellular and circuit information to understand basal ganglia function.
The progressive nature of behavioral deficits associated with PD is very well documented in human patients.
However, what neural adaptations associated with behavioral deficits at different stages of PD are not fully
understood. In this application, we try to address this with two different animal models. First, as in our preliminary
results and recent reports, we will administer different doses of neurotoxin administration to induce different
degrees of DA neuronal loss, which elicit the different behavioral deficits. Second, we will confirm the neurotoxin-
induced PD-related behaviors in MitoPark mice which show the progressive loss of DA neurons. Examining the
circuit adaptation in two animal models will provide an important information on the neural mechanisms
underlying the progressive nature of PD. Therefore, using cutting-edge techniques including optogenetic, genetic
and viral-mediated manipulation, in vivo multi-unit recording, and so on, we will decipher roles of VGLUT2GPe
neurons in behavioral deficits in these two animal models for PD."
11072336,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Severe Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (PARDS) is a life-threatening condition with high
mortality (33%). Novel therapies to improve mortality in this condition are critical. Multiple retrospective studies
from our group and others have demonstrated an association between early enteral nutrition (EEN) and
decreased mortality in children with PARDS, but mechanisms for this association are unclear. Crosstalk
between the lung and gut microbiome is a potential mechanism by which EEN may reduce PARDS mortality.
Diet can rapidly alter the relative abundance of beneficial butyrate-producing commensal gut bacteria to
increase fecal butyrate. In animal models of ARDS, butyrate pre-treatment decreases lung inflammation and
injury. We hypothesize, that in severe PARDS, EEN increases relative abundance of butyrate producing gut
commensals, thereby increasing butyrate levels and reducing acute lung inflammation and injury. EEN is a
novel pathway to improve outcomes in these children. The PROSpect study, a multi-center, NIH-funded
clinical trial, will randomize 1000 children with severe PARDS to compare positioning and ventilation strategies
to improve patient outcomes. This clinical trial presents a unique opportunity to investigate potential
mechanistic underpinnings of EEN as a targeted approach to improve outcomes for children with severe
PARDS. We will conduct our study as an ancillary study to the PROSpect study. The specific aims of our
study are: Aim 1:To test the hypothesis that relative abundance of butyrate producing fecal bacteria,
fecal butyrate, and patient outcomes differ by EEN exposure in severe PARDS. We will obtain fecal
specimens from 180 patients on days 0-7 of mechanical ventilation to assess the effect of EEN and type of
EEN ( ± prebiotics) on the gut microbiome signature with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We will assess
differences in measured fecal butyrate and other short chain fatty acids (SCFA) by EEN and type of EEN. On a
subset of fecal samples, we will use whole genome shotgun metagenomics sequencing (WGS) to identify
species and strains of butyrate-producing commensal bacteria important in patients with PARDS. Aim 2: To
test the hypothesis that lower respiratory tract inflammation, acute lung injury, and innate immune cell
gene expression patterns differ by fecal SCFA concentration in severe PARDS. We will obtain
endotracheal aspirate specimens from patients in Aim 1 on PARDS days 0 and 3 to test associations between
fecal SCFA and critical cytokines implicated in PARDS lung pathophysiology, and key biomarkers of PARDS
acute lung injury. We will utilize whole tracheal aspirate single nuclei RNASeq (snRNASeq) to compare gene
expression patterns for tracheal aspirate immune cell populations in patients by fecal butyrate. This study will
improve our understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings for how EEN may improve clinical outcomes of
PARDS. Loss of butyrate producing commensal bacteria may prove to be a critical diagnostic readout for risk
assessment or to identify potential microbial-based treatment to improve outcomes for children with PARDS."
10873043,"The Training Program in Host-Pathogen Interactions (HPI) has supported four (4) predoctoral
students per year in the areas of microbial pathogenesis and host defense for the past 9 years.
This renewal application seeks to continue our success at this same level and will build upon the
many strengths that have been developed at UMCP over these first two funding periods. Our now
29 training faculty are remarkably interactive, allowing our trainees to be exposed to a variety of
diverse research techniques and approaches. Multi-disciplinary methodologies to pathogen
research will be emphasized to take advantage of our widespread expertise in diverse research
areas including biomaterials and nanosciences, computational biology and genomics,
microbiology and immunology, and microbial pathogenesis. Trainees in the HPI program will be
exposed to a variety of career alternatives, and attend panels and workshops from previous
trainees and other professionals who have positions in academia, government, biotech, scientific
review, intellectual property, science writing, and entrepreneurship. The didactic component of
this training program is organized through the Biological Sciences Training Program (BISI) and
the research program is guided by a highly qualified team including the Training Program Co-
Directors, an Internal Steering Committee, and an Outside Advisory Committee comprised of
experts in bacterial pathogenesis, host defense and T32 administration. Predoctoral students are
selected for this program from a large and increasingly qualified applicant pool. Of the 18 trainees
supported by the HPI Training Program over the last 5 years, two (2) are from underrepresented
populations (11%), and 9/18 trainees (50%) were women. Outcomes of these trainees have been
outstanding, with an average of 4 papers per trainee. For the 7 who defended their PhD, the
average is 5 papers each and all are now in postdoctoral fellowships (6) or research education
(1). Of the 29 faculty trainers, 2 are from underrepresented populations (7%) and 6 are women
(21%). This HPI training program takes advantage of the close proximity of UMCP to the NIH,
FDA, WRAIR, and the Department of Homeland Security and we have sent students into
laboratories from all of these institutions to learn techniques. Finally, our trainees present their
research at local, national, and international meetings. Thus, the Training Program in Host-
Pathogen Interactions plays a key role in the continued development of HPI at the University of
Maryland, College Park."
10850790,"Project Summary
EBV latent infection is responsible for ~200,000 new cancers per year. To date, there are no EBV-
specific therapeutic agents that selectively and efficaciously treat EBV-positive tumors. All known
EBV tumors consistently express one viral nuclear protein, EBNA1, that is required for maintaining
the EBV genome and promoting infected cell survival. We have developed highly selective, drug-like
small molecules that bind EBNA1 and block its ability to bind DNA, maintain EBV genomes, and
promote host-cell survival. Here we propose to better understand the mechanism through which
disruption of EBNA1 DNA binding leads to tumor growth inhibition, and use this information to identify
rational combinatorial agents to enhance chemotherapeutic efficacy. We propose to enhance the
potency of the first generation EBNA1 inhibitors by attaching proteasome targeting molecules
(PROTACS) to selectively target EBNA1 for degradation. Finally, we will take advantage of new
mechanistic data revealing that EBNA1 functions as an OriP-specific endonuclease and resolvase.
We propose to develop new structure and mechanism-based inhibitors of EBNA1 that can increase
potency necessary for highly efficacious cancer therapy. By integrating these strategies to
understand the growth arrest response of EBNA1 inhibition (aim 1) to better develop rational
approaches for combinatorial therapies (aim 2) and develop next generation molecule with
structure/mechanism based drug design principles (aim 3), we will advance EBNA1 inhibitors for the
treatment of EBV-associated malignancies and related-diseases. We will test the overarching
hypothesis that EBNA1 is an effective target for small molecule inhibitors to treat EBV
cancers. The major goal of this proposal is to understand the tumor cell response to EBNA1
inhibition and to enhance efficacy of EBNA1 inhibitors to treat EBV-associated cancers more
efficaciously. The team associated with this proposal has the unique expertise and strong
collaborative history to execute the aims of this proposal. Collectively, these investigations will
provide fundamental insights into how EBNA1 functions at the molecular level and will lay the
foundation for the development of new strategies to treat EBV cancers."

The contribution of individual disease-relevant genes to brain development still remains unknown. The long-term
goal of our laboratory is to elucidate the intersection of molecular signaling pathways that are disrupted in
neurodevelopmental disorders with those pathways that are important for specific aspects of brain development.
Two members of the FOXP family of transcription factors, FOXP1 and FOXP2, have been linked to monogenetic
forms of intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, and specific speech and language deficits. Variants in
FOXP1 or FOXP2 are among the most significant genes associated with autism spectrum disorders. We
previously showed that Foxp1 and Foxp2 both have significant contributions to cortical and striatal development.
We linked these developmental changes via studies of gene expression, electrophysiology, and behaviors. We
further identified non-cell-autonomous changes in gene expression using newly available single-cell RNA-
sequencing technology. Based on these data, the central hypothesis driving this proposal is that Foxp1
and Foxp2 are key orchestrators of transcriptional signaling cascades in a cell type-specific manner that
are important for neuronal function and are at risk in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. We
propose to identify these cell type-specific contributions in the developing cortex by using rodent models through
three specific aims: 1) Determine the cell type-specific gene expression programs regulated by Foxp1 in the
developing cortex; 2) Determine the cell type-specific gene expression programs regulated by Foxp2 in the
developing cortex; and 3) Assess the role of Foxp1 and Foxp2 in cell type-specific activity-dependent neuronal
function. Together, these aims will delineate the cell type contribution of both Foxp1 and Foxp2 to cortical
development. The rodent models and cell-type specific genomic datasets will aprovide insight into the basic
molecular mechanisms governing normal mammalian brain development."
10823256,"ABSTRACT:
Adult skeletal muscle has the ability to repair and regenerate following exercise, trauma or disease-induced
damage despite being comprised of multinucleated muscle fibers whose nuclei cannot divide. This property is
primarily attributable to adult myogenic precursor cells (satellite cells). When activated in response to local
muscle damage, satellite cells proliferate extensively, either self-renew to reconstitute the reserve muscle
progenitor pool or differentiate into new skeletal muscle fibers by fusing with each other or into the existing
muscle fiber. Because satellite cells display lineage-specific differentiation (muscle cell) and self-renewal, two
characteristics of stem cells, they are considered the primary resident adult stem cells of skeletal muscle. While
intensive research efforts have advanced our understanding of satellite cell biology since their discovery in 1961,
the regulatory mechanism(s) controlling satellite cell number remain unknown. Here we provide evidence
implicating FGF6 signaling, which can be modulated by the Hippo pathway mediator TEAD1 in skeletal muscle
fibers, in the regulation of adult mouse satellite cell number. We previously investigated a mouse model with
transgenic TEAD1 overexpression in the muscle fiber and discovered a remarkable up to 6-fold increase in the
number of satellite cells without any changes in overall muscle size. We further determined that paracrine
signal(s) from the TEAD1-expressing myofiber signal for the satellite cell pool expansion in this mouse model.
Applying transcriptomics to this mouse model, we have identified FGF signaling, i.e. FGF2 and FGF6, as a
physiologically relevant pathway regulating satellite cell pool size. Indeed, our preliminary analysis of skeletal
muscle from Fgf6 mutant mice reveals a significant reduction in the number of satellite cells. This reduction is
further exacerbated in mice, in which the two FGF receptors predominantly expressed by satellite cells are
inactivated specifically in the myogenic lineage. Our goal is to determine the role of FGF signaling from the
myofiber to the satellite cell in achieving a particular pool size of adult muscle progenitor cells for effective repair
of muscle tissue throughout life, and how myofiber-specific TEAD1 is regulating paracrine signaling from the
myofiber to contribute to regulate this process. Specific Aims: 1) Determine the role of FGF6 and FGF2 in
perinatal SC scaling and adult muscle regeneration, 2) Determine the role of Fgfr1 and Fgfr4 in the SC perinatally
and in adulthood, 3) Determine how TEAD-mediated transcriptional regulation within the myofiber governs SC
pool scaling. We expect new fundamental findings into how the size of the satellite cell population in muscle is
specified during development and adaptively maintained during adult life. Insight into how the number of
regenerative cells (stem cells) in muscle is controlled provides an entry into the development of new cell-based
therapies against muscle wasting diseases, sport/combat injury, and age-related sarcopenia."

Metabolic disease is a massive worldwide health problem as illustrated by the current epidemics in obesity and
type 2 diabetes, which is especially prominent in the United States and showing no sign of abating. As such,
there is an urgent need for metabolism research to face this alarming situation. However, there are relatively
few training programs across the country specifically dedicated to the training of bright young predoctoral
researchers in metabolism at the systemic, cellular and molecular level. To address this need we have set up
the Molecular Metabolism Training Program (MMTP) at the University of Chicago, which incorporates the
Committee on Molecular Metabolism & Nutrition (CMMN) and thus is one of the few graduate programs in the
United States granting a PhD in molecular metabolism. A successful training program in metabolism requires a
multi- and inter-disciplinary approach, made up of researchers with a wide variety of technical skills and
research experience. The MMTP takes advantage of the marvelous and highly interactive biomedical
environment and strong traditions in metabolic and diabetes research at the University of Chicago. The trainers
in the MMTP, in whose laboratories MMTP trainees will conduct their research projects, have primary
appointments across many departments and sections of the Biological Sciences Division, but have a unifying
interest in understanding the causes and potential therapies for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, from molecular,
metabolic and/or immunologic viewpoints. Being interdepartmental, the MMTP pre-doctoral trainees can take
courses and gain experience in Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, Genetics, Medicine,
Immunology, Physiology and Neurobiology with a required comprehensive specialized metabolism core-
curriculum. Trainees must also attend metabolism journal clubs, data sessions, seminar series, and an annual
multi-disciplinary retreat. Participation in National and International metabolism, diabetes and/or obesity
scientific meetings is expected. There is strong institutional support, as well as a significant allocation of new
research space and equipment for the MMTP. Many outstanding applicants currently apply to the CMMN and
Biomedical Science Cluster (Immunology, Microbiology and Cancer Biology), and the recruitment success rate
into these programs is high. Pre-doctoral trainees recently graduated from the CMMN have found postdoctoral
positions in foremost academic metabolism research laboratories and some have moved on to establish their
own academic research groups, which we expect to continue under the MMTP. The ultimate goal of the MMTP
is to set up young researchers on the path to become independent academic diabetes research scientists and
mentors themselves – dedicated to excellent scholarship and making breakthrough discoveries in that will lead
to new therapies to better treat, prevent and perhaps even cure these disorders."

Objectives: Three-dimensional (3D) genome organization is a major contributor to genome func-
tion, and yet, we are only at the very dawn of discovering the structural signatures that underlie that
organization. Thus, the goal of the proposed studies is to develop and apply tools that will enable se-
quence-specific imaging of human genomes, in their entirety, with high genomic resolution. In particu-
lar, the proposed work will innovate methods for fixed and live cell imaging using diffraction-limited light
microscopy and super-resolution microscopy as well as develop new tools for image analysis and ge-
nome modeling. To this end, it will involve the continued collaboration of four laboratories, whose col-
lective breadth of expertise covers the fields of classical and molecular genetics, chromosome dynam-
ics, imaging, Hi-C analysis, convolutional neural networks, and polymer physics-based and restraint-
based modeling. An equally important objective of the proposed studies is to ensure a generation of re-
searchers whose personal breadth of expertise will come to match that of the entire current team.
 Health relatedness: Will a solid grasp of 3D genome organization have implications for under-
standing human development? Will it contribute to the protection of human health? Will it contribute to
strategies for early diagnostics and perhaps even the development of new therapies? The answer to all
these questions is almost certainly a resounding Yes, as knowledge of 3D genome organization will en-
hance our capacity to address both fundamental biological processes as well as disease.
 Innovation: An abundance of studies argue that genomes function as integrated units and, yet, no
extant technologies enable sequence-specific imaging of entire genomes at high genomic resolution.
Thus, the capacity of researchers to fathom the interplay between 3D genome organization and ge-
nome function has been limited to disjointed snapshots of localized events. Accordingly, first three aims
will develop the next tier of tools to put entire genomes within reach. They will advance a new method,
OligoFISSEQ, and then integrate it with OligoSTORM and OligoDNA-PAINT to finally achieve high-
throughput imaging at both conventional and super-resolution. They will also tackle two genomic fea-
tures that have been prohibitively difficult to capture – presence of homologs in diploid cells and highly
repeated sequences – as well as innovate strategies for high volume data storage, image processing
and analysis, and modeling. Finally, a fourth aim will implement methods for disseminating our tools.
 1. Scaling technologies toward whole genome imaging
 2. Filling in gaps to visualize chromosomes end-to-end – tackling homologs and repeats
 3. Probe design, image analysis, modeling, and integration of epigenetic data
 4. Training, resources, and opportunities for engaging colleagues in whole genome imaging"
10834093,"Project Summary/Abstract
Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium) is a major nosocomial pathogen that causes severe diarrheal
disease that is highly infectious and difficult to treat. C. difficile is easily transmitted due to the formation and
expulsion of up to 108 spores/ml of stool from infected hosts. The spore form of C. difficile is resistant to most
disinfectants and is critical for the survival of the bacterium outside of the host intestine. Unfortunately, little is
known about the intestinal signals that lead to spore formation. The long-term goal of this investigation is to
uncover how nutrition drives C. difficile pathogenesis and transmission. The specific objectives of this
application are to determine which distinct nutritional pathways and effectors have the greatest impact on spore
production, and how these effects are regulated. Based on our data, we hypothesize that specific intestinal
metabolites promote toxin expression and spore formation, while other metabolites impede these processes.
The rationale underlying these studies is that uncovering the nutritional cues that drive the production of spores
will help us understand how disease and transmission occur. In our preliminary studies, we identified specific
nutrients that have dramatic effects on C. difficile spore formation. Capitalizing on our previous experiences in
C. difficile molecular genetics, metabolic gene regulation, and Gram-positive intestinal pathogenesis, we will
meet the objectives through the experiments detailed in two specific aims. To begin, we will define the specific
pathways affected by these compounds and then evaluate the impact of influential nutrients on C. difficile spore
formation and transmission. In parallel, we will dissect the regulatory mechanisms that link specific nutrients to
spore formation. This research is innovative because it takes advantage of the latest information about the
intestinal environment that supports CDI, and combines biochemical and genetic approaches to answer
fundamental questions about this important and complex biological process. The expected contribution of this
research is a detailed understanding of the relevant bacterial pathways that enable C. difficile sporulation in
response to specific nutrients. Moreover, this work is an essential step in the development of rational strategies
to impede C. difficile transmission by preventing the formation of infectious spores in the host."

Project Summary:
Sepsis is a poorly understood clinical syndrome characterized by dysregulated host response to infection. The
complexity and heterogeneity of the host response has frustrated attempts at developing effective treatments.
In partnership with 6 U.S. hospitals, Prenosis amassed NOSIS, one of the world’s largest datasets and biobanks
that combines biomarker and clinical data for patients suspected of infection, housing over 60,000 plasma or
serum samples from over 12,000 patients. We also curated a dataset of dense time-series data from each
patient’s Electronic Medical Record (EMR), including demographics, vitals, lab results, interventions, outcomes,
and many other parameters.
In this project, Prenosis will build upon previous work to conduct targeted analyses of the individual treatment
effects of corticosteroids on septic patient outcomes. Using propensity score matching on patient baseline data
(their biomarker/EMR profile at the time they were suspected of serious infection), we have identified 1,350 pairs
of treatment and control patients whose samples have already been collected and stored in the biobank. We will
leverage our existing pipeline to measure the 40 core biomarkers on 8,100 samples for these 2,700 patients: the
pre-treatment sample closest to the time at which the treatment patient received steroids, the sample closest to
24 hours after the treatment patient received steroids, and the patients’ final samples to understand how
treatment impacted biomarker profile and how these changes are associated with clinical outcomes of interest.
These data and analyses will serve as the basis for at least three immediately commercializable products. First,
elucidating which patients are likely to benefit or suffer from treatment with corticosteroids will improve diagnostic
and clinical decision support products that are deployable within Prenosis’ existing ImmunixTM platform. Second,
this will demonstrate the NOSIS dataset is a powerful platform for predictive enrichment of clinical trials.
Estimating individual treatment effects in NOSIS identifies the optimal patient subpopulations to be recruited for
clinical trials, which would otherwise fail. Third, understanding treatment effects on biomarker profile and
corresponding association with clinical outcomes will establish the NOSIS host response profile as effective
surrogate endpoints for clinical trials."

 The polymorphic transporter OATP1B1 plays significant roles in the hepatic uptake and disposition of
endogenous molecules and drugs. Further, OATP1B1 is involved in numerous drug-drug interactions (DDIs) due
to its multispecificity. Despite decades of research, many factors related to the determinants of ligand binding,
transport mechanism and energetics, as well as the structure of this important transporter are unresolved. The
long-term goal is to characterize hepatic transport at the microscopic and macroscopic levels. Due to the
functional importance of OATP1B1 in liver clearance, this is the first target studied. The central hypothesis is that
structures of human OATP1B1 and functional assays performed on isolated proteins will unequivocally define
the mechanism of ligand binding, transport, and inhibition. The rationale that underlies this research is that
protein structures coupled with unambiguous, reproducible activity assays are absolutely required to fully
characterize the mechanism of transport and resolve long-standing conflicting data reported in the literature.
Establishing robust expression and purification protocols for human OATP1B1 facilitates pursuing the two
Specific Aims: 1) Resolve structures of OATP1B1 by Cryo-EM and analyze their motions by MD simulations. 2)
Functionally characterize the transport mechanism of OATP1B1. For the 1st Aim, the optimal conditions that
result in the highest image quality for Cryo-EM of OATP1B1 would be screened, and data would be acquired in
the presence and absence of ligands. The Cryo-EM studies will be augmented by MD simulations and docking
studies that would reveal details that are not accessible by mere structural analysis. The different biochemical
conditions (apo and holo) increase the likelihood of A) solving the structural determinants of the binding of various
ligands (with distinct chemistries) to the two ligand-binding sites of OATP1B1. B) solving the structures of multiple
conformations that are part of the transport cycle. For the 2nd Aim, we will use purified protein reconstituted into
proteoliposomes to characterize the inherent properties of OATP1B1 such as the energizing ion for transport,
the influence of the membrane voltage, and pH. Those results would be compared with cellular assays that
include intact cellular machinery, and other plasma membrane transporters that might directly or indirectly affect
OATP1B1. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion because it
introduces two methodologies that have never been explored for any OATP isoform. These could uncover a
plethora of novel insights into the structure/function relationship of OATP1B1. The proposed research is
significant since OATP1B1 is involved in DDIs of several commonly prescribed drugs, sometimes resulting in
life-threatening situations. This study would unravel the exact determinants of ligand binding to OATP1B1 and
transport. Ultimately, the structural and functional knowledge generated here has the potential to aid in the design
of drugs that exhibit a lower propensity for DDIs."
10794401,"Many of our most important therapeutics were inspired by bacterial small molecules (natural products, NPs).
Although microbial NPs display a wide range of bioactivities, they have offered their greatest utility as anticancer
agents and antibiotics. The incredible success of NPs as lead structures for therapeutic development is thought
to be due to their unique structural and mode of action refinement from eons of evolutionary selective pressures.
Since many drug discovery programs deprioritized NPs due to unacceptably high rediscovery rates, bioinformatic
analyses of genomic sequence data, whether from cultured bacteria or metagenomes, has revealed that the
biosynthetic diversity accessed by traditional monoculture fermentation studies represents only a small fraction
of the NPs that are actually encoded by the global microbiome. Unlocking the metabolites encoded by this large
fraction of previously inaccessible biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) should provide structurally and
mechanistically novel molecules that can serve as inspirations for new anticancer agents. Traditional NPs
discovery methods rely on biological processes (i.e., transcription, translation and enzymes) to convert genetic
instructions contained in bacterial genomes into novel bioactive small molecules. Unfortunately, with these
methods it has not been possible to coax laboratory grown bacteria into producing all the different NPs they are
capable of making. We have therefore developed a “biology free” discovery approach where, instead of decoding
genetic instructions using biological processes, bioinformatic algorithms are used to predict the chemical
structures produced by bacteria and then chemical synthesis is used to build these structures, which we have
called Synthetic Bioinformatic NPs (syn-BNPs). This proposal is designed to bring together advanced
bioinformatics, total chemical synthesis, and next-generation metagenomic methods to identify syn-BNP
antiproliferative agents that are inspired by BGCs which, until now, have remained hidden in the genomes of
cultured bacteria and metagenomes. Interestingly, nearly half of all drugs in clinical use today are inspired by
nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) or mixed polyketide-NRPs. Fortuitously, NRP biosynthesis is unique in that
bioinformatic algorithms have developed to the point where it is possible to predict many NRP structures from
primary data sequence alone. Concurrently with these bioinformatic advances, robust methods for synthetically
producing NRP-like structure have become simple and economical, making uncharacterized NRP BGCs model
targets for syn-BNP discovery studies and a potentially rich source of mechanistically diverse and novel
antiproliferative agents. With this in mind, in Aim 1 bioinformatic analysis of NRP BGCs found in publicly available
data bases will be used to inspire syn-BNPs that will be screened for differential antiproliferative activity across
a panel of diverse cancer lines. In Aim 2, metagenomic BGCs will be sequenced and used to inspire additional
syn-BNPs for antiproliferative activity screening. In Aim 3, antiproliferative syn-BNP hits will be mechanistically

The functional limitations and logistical challenges of using patient-derived (autologous) products for adoptive T
cell therapy has prompted the exploration of a universal source of “off-the-shelf” T cells generated from self-
renewing PSCs which can be readily genetically engineered to enhance function and expanded without limit.
However current PSC differentiation systems are characterized by low T cell output and concurrent production
of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). Our preliminary studies suggest that the earliest stages of T cell specification
and commitment seen during PSC differentiation do not fully recapitulate either normal human thymopoiesis or
in vitro models that use definitive hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) to initiate T cell development.
The goal of this proposal is to understand the cellular and molecular differences between normal and
PSC-derived T cell development, with a focus on the role of the transcription factor BCL11B. T cells are
generated in the thymus after notch signaling from the microenvironment triggers a series of transcriptional
events that initiate the T-lineage program in HSPCs; these events first produce early thymic progenitors (ETPs)
(T lineage specification) and then extinguish alternative (non-T) lineage programs in multipotent ETPs (T lineage
commitment). BCL11B is a critical regulator of both of these processes. Our published and preliminary data show
that, in contrast to the mouse model, BCL11B is essential for T cell specification during human thymopoiesis and
initiates the expression of several T-cell genes. Moreover, when BCL11B is overexpressed in cord blood HSPCs,
the T cell program is launched more rapidly and efficiently, even in the absence of notch signaling. Surprisingly
little is known about how the T cell lineage is generated from PSCs. Through scRNA-Seq analysis we have
identified candidate ETPs and their immediate progeny as they emerge from PSC-derived hematopoiesis. We
hypothesize that the rare PSC-derived ETPs in which the T cell program is launched are functionally and
transcriptionally different from ETPs in the thymus, and that these intrinsic differences are detrimental
for the generation of conventional T cells from PSCs. Further, we propose that chromatin remodeling induced
by BCL11B mediates both T lineage specification and the fate decisions between the conventional T cell and
innate lymphoid pathways. Specifically we will: 1. Define the earliest T lineage progenitors generated during PSC
differentiation; 2. Determine the epigenetic underpinnings of T-cell specification in PSC-ATOs and in primary
thymopoiesis; and 3. Define how BCL11B affects conventional T and innate lineage fate choices. These studies
will yield new mechanistic insights about T-cell differentiation that are critical for the development of PSC-derived
T-cell immunotherapies."

Gut microbiota dysbiosis is associated with many chronic inflammatory diseases. Accordingly, previous
studies have shown intestinal microbiota dysbiosis correlates increased risk of cardiac disease (CD) in
diabetic patients. Yet, the role of diabetes induced alteration of gut microbiota in CD remains largely
unexplored. Recent work from our lab showed that transplant of microbiotas from diabetic mice to non-
diabetic mice did not impact glycemic control but rather conferred marked cardiac dysfunction in
recipient mice, thus providing initial evidence that diabetic-mediated changes in the intestinal microbiota
may impact heart function, irrespective of dysglycemia. Our central hypothesis is that diabetes-induced
gut microbiota dysbiosis, leads to increased gut permeability and translocation of bacteria and their
products in a manner that contributes to inflammation and heart dysfunction. Thus, manipulating
microbiota may provide a means to prevent CD in diabetic mellitus. The initial aim of this proposal is to
characterize microbial targets that lead to inflammation and CD. The second specific aim is to examine
the extent to which diabetes-induced alterations in microbiota result in dissemination of gut bacteria or
their products leads to impaired heart function. Aim2 will also investigate role of reduced gut motility
and elevated intestinal luminal glucose levels in driving microbiota dysbiosis. Finally, we will explore
potential approaches to target gut microbiota or gut barrier function therapeutically thus lowering risk
of CD in person with diabetes mellitus. We will use a variety of immunological, microbiological,
nanotechnological techniques in the proposed project. We anticipate discovery of novel mechanism by
which gut microbiota links diabetes and CD. Furthermore, we expect to develop therapeutic strategies
to maintain a healthy intestinal-microbiota relationship that will avoid bacteria translocation and
inflammation that leads to impaired heart function in diabetes mellitus."

The precise activation of transcription in specific tissues and developmental stages is regulated by enhancer and
promoter interactions (EPIs), whose alterations cause developmental defects and cancer. Indeed, it is critical to
understand the mechanism by which enhancers are responsible for tissue- and time-specific gene activation.
 Despite the importance of EPIs, the mechanisms by which EPIs are formed are still largely unknown, and
available models are still debated. In particular, the central open questions can be listed as follows: 1) Is contact
between enhancer and promoter necessary, or is proximity enough? 2) Are the EPIs stable or dynamic? To
address these knowledge gaps, in his K99 Aim1, Dr. Gabriele will set up a super-resolution 3D live-cell imaging
(SRLCI) system to visualize the role of EPIs in transcription activation in a prototype gene. He will focus Aim1
on Foxg1, which is expressed after differentiating pluripotent cells to cortical neurons. Also, in neuronal lineages,
the Foxg1 promoter displays a long-range interaction with an enhancer region, absent in pluripotency, thus
making Foxg1 the ideal candidate to answer the study EPIs during differentiation. Notably, Dr. Gabriele has
previously established an SRLCI methodology to study chromatin looping and found that these structures are
rare and transitory. Here, he will dedicate the previous methodology to studying EPIs.
 In Aim2 (R00 phase), he will build on his SRLCI work of Aim1 to investigate the role of chromatin
regulators and histone modification in regulating EPIs and establishing and maintaining transcription after cell
differentiation.
 Then, to measure to what extent the identified EPIs mechanism generalizes to all the EPIs, in Aim3
(between K99 and R00) he will employ sequencing methods to identify all the newly formed EPIs that result in
transcription activation while differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells to cortical neurons.
 Dr. Gabriele’s long-term goal is to achieve independence as a principal investigator to dedicate his study
to understanding the physiological and pathological mechanisms involved in the regulation of cell identity. For
this purpose, he will be supported by his mentor and Scientific Advisory Committee. During the K99 phase, he
will be trained in the experimental processing and analysis of single-cell genomics techniques such as SHARE-
seq and Micro-C, and 3D polymer simulations. Moreover, he will improve his imaging processing analysis and
deepen his bioinformatics knowledge.
 In addition, during the K99 phase, Dr. Gabriele will improve his scientific writing, outreach, mentoring and
teaching, and management skills with a focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion values. Completing the K99
research and training will significantly facilitate Dr. Gabriele’s transition to independence and success as an
independent investigator and mentor."

Following treatment for early-stage cancer, most survivors fear the possibility of a recurrence. While mild and
intermittent for many, these fears become clinically significant for approximately 40% of survivors, adversely
affecting mood, coping, and quality of life while simultaneously increasing healthcare use and associated
costs. Particularly vulnerable are breast cancer survivors (BCS) who are 33% more likely to report clinically
significant fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) than other survivors. Additionally, FCR is the top unmet need
among BCS, yet evidence-based treatments for FCR are lacking. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has
been the most frequently tested intervention for FCR, yielding modest effect sizes. A theoretically distinct
approach that may be better suited to BCS' experiences with FCR is Acceptance and Commitment Therapy
(ACT). The goal of ACT is to increase psychological flexibility so that difficult internal experiences (e.g., fearful
thoughts and feelings) interfere less with meaningful activities and quality of life. Psychological flexibility is
comprised of mindfulness/acceptance processes (i.e., compassionate attention to the present moment) and
commitment/behavior change processes (i.e., identifying and acting in line with personal values). Our team
conducted a 3-arm pilot randomized controlled trial in BCS with clinical FCR comparing group-based ACT to
an attention-matched survivorship education (SE) group and enhanced usual care (EUC; brief coaching with
self-administered readings). Rapid recruitment (91 BCS in 12 weeks) and high retention (94.5% through 6
months) demonstrated outstanding feasibility. Our 6-week ACT intervention was superior to SE and EUC in
reducing FCR and improving several other outcomes at 6 months post-intervention. Based on these promising
pilot trial results, we propose a 3-arm phase III randomized controlled trial of ACT compared to CBT and EUC
for early stage (I-IIIA) BCS 0-5 years post-treatment (N=375) reporting clinically significant FCR. All
interventions will be delivered via videoconferencing. Using the Indiana State Cancer Registry and Indiana
Network for Patient Care database, we will recruit BCS from five oncology facilities, including one that
specializes in the care of racially, ethnically, and economically diverse survivors. Specific aims are to: (1) test
the efficacy of group-based ACT compared to CBT and EUC on FCR (primary outcome) and anxiety,
depressive symptoms, post-traumatic stress, avoidant coping, and quality of life (secondary outcomes) over 12
months; (2) examine change in psychological flexibility as a mediator of ACT's effects on FCR over 12 months;
and (3) perform comparative assessment of ACT, CBT, and EUC to determine the cost-effective intervention
for FCR. Our ability to demonstrate ACT's efficacy will lead to its widespread dissemination to BCS. Findings
will also inform further application and refined testing of ACT with various cancer populations and health-
related outcomes."

Two-thirds of Americans report regularly obtaining an insufficient amount of sleep. Chronic sleep deficiency is
associated with a multitude of negative health consequences, including obesity, cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Habitually sleeping less than the recommended seven hours per night has
been linked to increased all-cause mortality and increased risk of mortality associated with metabolic syndrome,
and prospective epidemiological studies have found an association between short sleep duration and increased
risk of type 2 diabetes. Laboratory studies have shown that sleep restriction to 4-6 hours per night for durations
varying from one to 14 days reduces glucose tolerance in otherwise healthy adults. It is now recognized that
sleep restriction decreases insulin sensitivity. Multiple additional causative pathways have been explored,
including reduced brain glucose utilization, increased sympathetic nervous activity, elevated evening cortisol
levels, etc. However, sleep restriction in both free-ranging humans and prior experimental studies is
accompanied by longer exposure to Artificial Light At Night (ALAN), an endocrine disruptor which can disrupt
circadian rhythmicity. It has recently been recognized that circadian disruption itself can impair glucose
metabolism. We hypothesize that endocrine and circadian disruption caused by extended duration ALAN may
contribute to the adverse metabolic effects induced by chronic sleep restriction. To test this hypothesis, we will
systematically evaluate glucose metabolism in healthy adults in controlled laboratory conditions (light,
temperature, diet and activity patterns) using a crossover design consisting of a 7-day baseline, 7-day sleep
restriction (to 5h per night) with (Light:Dark 19:5) or without (Light:Dark 14:10) ALAN, 9-day washout, and another
7-day sleep restriction with or without ALAN. Glucose metabolism (using an intravenous glucose tolerance test
and a Standardized Mixed Meal Response) and circadian rhythms (using 24-h profiles of plasma melatonin and
cortisol) will be assessed before and after each sleep restriction segment. Understanding whether extended
duration ALAN is a primary upstream exposure that contributes to the sleep-restriction-induced impairment of
glucose metabolism and consequent increase in diabetes risk is important given the widespread prevalence of
sleep deficiency. By clarifying a potential modifiable mechanism by which sleep restriction adversely affects
whole-body energy homeostasis, our findings will lay the groundwork for the development of novel treatments
and countermeasures to mitigate the adverse metabolic effects of chronic sleep restriction."

This career development proposal will support Dr. Enrico Castillo to become an independent researcher
focused on serious mental illness (SMI), incarceration, homelessness, and public mental health systems, with
expertise in conducting mixed methods studies to improve the capacity of public systems to eradicate the
health and social inequities experienced by individuals with SMI. People with SMI experience severe
inequities, which are particularly evident within homeless populations and correctional facilities where people
with SMI are grossly overrepresented. These national challenges are reflected in Los Angeles County, which
has the largest unsheltered population of people with SMI in the US. The Los Angeles County jail is the largest
facility in the world for the confinement of people with SMI. In the face of scarce public mental health resources
and concentrations of people with mental illness in jails, some have posited that jails may serve important
public health functions and have positive mental health effects on individuals with SMI. This raises important
scientific questions. Dr. Castillo plans to focus his research on understanding the unmet health and social
needs of individuals with SMI by studying the effects of incarceration on subsequent health and social
trajectories—the jail-to-homelessness pipeline. Dr. Castillo’s proposal centers on mentored career
development and research activities that will develop the skills to achieve these career goals: 1) quantitative
analysis of linked administrative data, 2) qualitative research methods, specifically ethnography, archival
research, and mixed methods dialogue, 3) criminal justice systems and vulnerable justice-involved populations,
and 4) dissemination and translation of health services research findings to policy and practice. Given the
challenges of studying individuals after jail release, relatively less is known about the precise relationship
between incarceration and subsequent homelessness and its downstream effects on healthcare and social
trajectories for people with SMI. Fragmented systems of care and siloed data infrastructures are additional
barriers to research, coordination of care, allocation of resources, and public health planning. To address these
lacunae, Dr. Castillo’s research project will 1) use an existing linked administrative database of eight public
service agencies in Los Angeles County to understand whether jail is disruptive to mental health and social
service use and housing stability for people with SMI; 2) conduct archival research and direct ethnographic
observations in the Los Angeles County jail to elucidate the jail experiences and services and ascertain the
mechanisms underlying post-incarceration trajectories; and 3) prepare for a R01 health services research grant
(PAR-17-264). Building on this project’s findings about factors that lead to post-incarceration homelessness,
that future multi-site R01 will employ the same mixed methods to investigate the full circuit of institutional
recidivism (reincarceration, hospitalization, homelessness), to identify the public service use trajectories,
programs, and other mutable factors (individual- to system-level) that prevent or disrupt those outcomes."

Given that cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders are an increasingly prevalent global epidemic and
these disorders significantly contribute to both increased mortality and increased years lived with disability, it is
vital to understand the pathogenesis of these disorders. Epidemiologically, chronic stress has a prominent role
in cardiometabolic risk. Neural processes are known to influence physiologic responses to stress. However,
the specific mechanisms that underlie sex-dependent changes in endocrine and metabolic physiology after
chronic stress are not well understood. Therefore, the research outlined in this proposal aims to determine how
specific neural circuitry influences stress reactivity and, consequently, metabolic health in male and female
rats. Specifically, testing the hypothesis that signaling from the infralimbic cortex (IL) to the rostral ventrolateral
medulla (RVLM) mitigates endocrine stress reactivity after chronic stress in a sex-specific manner. The
following specific aims will be addressed: 1) determines if activation of the IL-RVLM circuit mitigates endocrine
responses to glycemic challenge and psychological stress in male and female rats. 2) Determines if activation
of the IL-RVLM circuit following exposure to chronic stress reduces female susceptibility to endocrine hyper-
reactivity. Activation of the IL-RVLM circuit will be achieved using optogenetic stimulation. Acute restraint will
be used as a psychological stressor to measure activation of stress hormones, namely glucocorticoids,
glucose, glucagon, angiotensin II, and insulin. Glycemic challenge in the form of a glucose tolerance test will
be used a metabolic stressor. In aim 2, chronic variable stress (CVS) exposure will consist of 14 days of twice-
daily randomized stressors. Following exposure to CVS, animals will undergo acute restraint and glycemic
challenge. In addition to stress hormones, glucose, glucagon, angiotensin II and insulin, non-invasive
measures of metabolism and autonomic activation such as heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature
will be taken during acute stress in both aims. Corticotropin Releasing Hormone mRNA will be quantified in the
hypothalamus. Additionally, basal metabolic measures will be taken in the form of bodyweight and food intake.
Taken together, these studies will provide novel insight into how cortical and brainstem processes integrate to
influence metabolic health in a sex-specific manner. This will further our understanding of how stress
contributes to metabolic and cardiovascular diseases."

Transposable elements (TEs) are genomic parasites that can negatively impact host viability and fertility. They
have been identified as the causes of inherited human disorders and cancers. Despite their detrimental effects,
TEs are prevalent across eukaryotic genomes and exhibit dramatic variation in abundance and genomic
positions within and between species. For instance, the proportion of vertebrate genomes occupied by TEs
ranges from only 6% in pufferfish to 65% in salamander. Over 45% of the human genome harbors TEs, and
any two people differ by at least a thousand TE insertions. However, it remains unclear what evolutionary
forces drive TE variation and how that influences functions and, thereby, host health. Most studies of the
harmful effects of TEs have centered on TE-mediated physical disruption of DNA and changes in DNA
sequences. While such genetic disturbances have important consequences, this paradigm overlooks the
detrimental epigenetic effects mediated by TEs, including biochemical modifications of chromatin and
reorganization of three-dimensional (3D) genome structures. My recent pioneering studies revealed, on a
genome-wide scale, that epigenetically silenced TEs can perturb the function of neighboring genes through cis
spreading of silencing marks (cis epigenetic effects of TEs) and alter 3D genome organization (3D epigenetic
effects of TEs). These exciting observations offer a possibility to answer long-unresolved questions about why
there are between-species differences in TE content and how these differences affect genome function and
evolution—the overarching goals of my research program. My laboratory uses Drosophila as a primary model
and integrates evolutionary genomics and cell biology to decipher the functional and evolutionary significance
of TE variation. One major goal of my research program is to determine how TE variation influences genome
evolution through my newly discovered 3D epigenetic effects of TEs. My research group will use integrative
genomic analysis at multiple levels (DNA, RNA, epigenetics, and 3D genome structures) to investigate our
hypothesis that the 3D epigenetic effects mediated by TEs can produce varying 3D genome organization. We
further predict that this TE-mediated variation in 3D genome structures can shape genome evolution by
affecting fundamental genetic processes. In addition, my laboratory seeks to identify the molecular and
evolutionary mechanisms contributing to between-species differences in TE content. We will use Drosophila
genetics and transgenics to identify host genetic factors that modulate the epigenetic effects of TEs in cis and
in 3D nuclear space. Furthermore, we will combine comparative evolutionary genomics and experimental
evolution to investigate our hypothesis that between-species variation in these host genetic factors contributes
to varying epigenetic effects of TEs and ultimately drives the evolution of divergent TE content across
Drosophila species. Our discoveries will provide a novel basis for understanding eukaryotic genome evolution
and open new perspectives for TEs' roles in human health and disease."

Selective neurodegeneration is a critical causal factor in Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, the mechanisms
that lead some neurons to perish while others remain resilient are unknown. There is regional susceptibility to
AD-related neurodegeneration in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Even within vulnerable neuronal
populations, however, some cells are lost early while others prove more resilient. With recent technical
improvements in single-cell analysis, we are able for the first time to examine the variability that drives regional
and cellular differences in susceptibility to neurodegeneration.
 The major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease is apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4), which increases disease
risk and decreases age of onset in carriers. Within the central nervous system, apoE is produced primarily in
astrocytes but also in neurons following stress, injury, and aging. Neuronal apoE4 expression diminishes
synaptic plasticity, impairs synaptogenesis, and decreases synaptic density both in vitro and in vivo.
 This proposal is based on intriguing preliminary studies. (1) Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data from our
lab have revealed a link between neuronal apoE and neuronal expression of the major histocompatibility complex
class I (MHC-I). Like apoE, MHC-I is expressed in neurons following stress, injury, and aging. Neuronal MHC-I
is localized to post-synaptic densities, where they limit long-term potentiation, enhance long term depression,
and mediate synaptic pruning during development and, potentially, in neurodegenerative diseases. Our
discovery of neuronal apoE upregulation of MHC-I provides insight into the mechanism by which both proteins
potentially work in concert to contribute to synapse loss and eventually to selective neurodegeneration. (2) In
AD patients, neuronal apoE expression correlates with neuronal MHC-I expression, which in turn predicts
severity of Tau pathologies. (3) In AD model mice or cultured primary neurons, neuron-specific apoE4 knock-out
decreases neuronal MHC-I expression and rescues neuronal and synaptic loss, establishing a causal
relationship between neuronal apoE, upregulation of MHC-I, and selective neurodegeneration in AD.
 To capitalize on these novel findings and recent technical improvements in single-cell analyses, this proposal
aims to determine the apoE-expression-high and MHC-I-expression-high neuron populations and explore their
relationships with selective neurodegeneration across AD-susceptible and AD-resistant brain regions of apoE-
KI mice with different apoE genotypes at different ages (Aim 1). We will also determine how apoE is regulating
neuronal expression of MHC-I and how this expression leads to Alzheimer’s disease-related pathologies (Aim
2). Finally, we propose to determine the extent to which this apoE and MHC-I-mediated neuronal loss is caused
by signaling to microglia (Aim 3), which has been heavily implicated in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. The
outcome of the proposed studies should shed light on the mechanisms underlying regional, cell-type-specific,
and within-cell-type selective vulnerability to Alzheimer’s disease."

More than 2 million people have opioid use disorder (OUD) in the U.S. and opioids accounted for 70% of the
nearly 100,000 drug-overdose deaths in 2020. Increasing OUD prevalence and opioid-involved overdose deaths
underscore the urgent need for improved access to effective OUD treatments. Methadone, buprenorphine, and
naltrexone are effective in treating OUD, yet these medications for OUD (MOUD) are underutilized, particularly
among low-income Medicaid beneficiaries who represent a sizable portion of the U.S. population living with OUD.
Prescription (Rx) caps represent a cost-containment strategy employed by some state Medicaid programs that
limit the number of brand name drugs or total number of prescriptions that may be filled each month. Rx cap
policies potentially exacerbate the opioid epidemic by impeding access to MOUD among financially constrained
Medicaid beneficiaries, many of whom have comorbid chronic health conditions (e.g., mental illness, chronic
pain, HIV), and who are forced to make tradeoffs between which medically necessary medications to fill. Though
a few older studies have used Medicaid data to evaluate the impact of Rx caps on the health of the general
population, until now, this has not been studied among people with OUD – an NIH priority population. The
objective of this application is to examine whether and how Medicaid Rx caps affect the care and health of people
with OUD and other chronic health conditions. Our long-term research goal is to develop an evidence base that
can be used to revise medication utilization management policies in ways that balance budget priorities with
improved patient and population health outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that Rx caps contribute to reduced
uptake of and continuity with MOUD treatment, resulting in increased overdoses and mortality. The rationale for
this hypothesis is that people with OUD frequently have co-occurring conditions and are likely to require several
simultaneous prescriptions to manage their health, placing them at risk for exceeding the caps. Our skilled team
of health services researchers, pharmacists, clinicians, and epidemiologists has extensive experience using
Medicaid claims data and qualitative methods to study the impact of health policies on marginalized populations.
We propose to analyze national Medicaid data to evaluate the impact of Rx cap policies on initiation and
continuity of MOUD use among individuals diagnosed with OUD; and determine the impact of Rx cap policies
on health services utilization, overdoses, and all-cause mortality among this population. We will then
contextualize our quantitative findings via interviews with patients with OUD and providers who practice in states
impacted by cap policies to elucidate their experiences with caps and identify best practices for navigating these
policies. Completion of this research will help to close critical knowledge gaps by generating novel mixed-method
findings on Rx drug coverage for OUD treatment and yield best-practice recommendations for navigating cap
policies. As states continue to consider strategies to address the worsening opioid and overdose crises, due
attention should be given to Medicaid benefit restrictions that can undermine individual and public health goals."

A majority of U.S. adolescents are not getting sufficient sleep for optimal health. Sleep health is critical during
adolescence because of rapid neurodevelopment, growth, and body composition changes. Moreover,
inadequate and poor-quality sleep can increase allostatic load, or cumulative physiological ‘wear and tear’, from
disruptions across multiple regulatory systems that coordinate immune, cardiovascular, and metabolic function.
Evidence indicates that developmental exposures to ubiquitous environmental toxicants may disrupt
neurobiological mechanisms that regulate sleep and allostasis. However, whether these exposures are
modifiable risk factors for poor sleep during adolescence has not been rigorously examined. Our multidisciplinary
project brings together experts in pediatric environmental health, sleep, and cardiometabolic health to identify
whether early life exposure to environmental toxicant mixtures disrupts adolescent sleep health and increases
allostatic load. This project focuses on mixtures of phthalates, per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and
metals. Most pregnant people, infants, and children are exposed to mixtures of these toxicants through diet and
consumer goods. The project leverages existing and new data from two well-characterized prospective
pregnancy and birth cohorts, the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study and the
Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study. Both cohorts previously enrolled
pregnant women and followed children until ages 7-9 (MIREC n=300) or 10-12 (HOME n=256) years with
additional visits underway at ages 10-12 (MIREC) and 16-18 (HOME) years. Sleep characteristics will be
examined at two timepoints in both cohorts using actigraphy. We will quantify relations between environmental
toxicant biomarkers during gestation, early childhood, school age, and adolescence with sleep characteristics
(Aim 1) and allostatic load (Aim 2) during adolescence. We will also examine whether exposure to environmental
toxicant mixtures is associated with hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity, catecholamines, and
systemic inflammation, biological intermediates of sleep-wake regulation and allostasis (Aim 3). Our analyses
will identify individual and joint effects of environmental toxicant mixtures and examine periods of heightened
susceptibility during critical developmental periods. Identifying modifiable environmental factors that contribute
to poor sleep health and allostatic load may inform novel interventions to reduce the risk of cardiovascular
disease, the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in adulthood worldwide."

While prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy (PSMA-RPT) improves the
survival of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients, response rates remain
suboptimal, and relapses invariably occur in all patients. Improving therapeutic efficacy requires a better
understanding of the genetic, molecular, and immunological determinants of tumor responses to PSMA RPT.
To identify such determinants we (i) performed dosimetry studies to optimize 177Lu-PSMA-RPT activity in
prostate cancer (PCa) models; (ii) conducted global phosphoproteomic analyses of tumors from PSMA-RPT-
treated mice and revealed the upregulation of DNA damage response/repair and TP53 pathways; (iii) showed
that wild type TP53 plays an important role in mediating responses to RPT in mice; and (iv) investigated the
impact of PSMA-RPT on the tumor immune microenvironment and demonstrated that PSMA-RPT synergizes
with pharmacological activators of the cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS)/Stimulator of Interferon genes
(STING) pathway, a cytosolic DNA sensing machinery that links DNA damage with the induction of innate
immune responses via type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Relatedly, data in the literature indicate that mutant
TP53, which occurs frequently in mCRPC, interferes with the function of the cGAS/STING/IFN pathway
thereby decreasing tumor immunogenicity. Collectively, these findings led us to hypothesize that (i) 177Lu-
PSMA-RPT triggers tumor TP53 mutational status-dependent tumor and immune cell signaling alterations in
mCRPC; (ii) profiling these alterations will identify new determinants of response to PSMA-RPT; and (iii)
targeting these determinants will enhance responses to PSMA-RPT.
We will test these hypotheses via three Specific Aims leveraging an integrated platform for systematic
profiling of RPT-induced transcriptional, signaling, and immunological alterations. In Aim 1, we will identify
RPT-induced signaling alterations in the tumor cell compartment of human PSMA-expressing PCa models and
test the hypothesis that mutant TP53 impairs responses to PSMA-RPT. In Aim 2, we will employ murine PCa
models with wild-type or mutated TP53 to investigate how tumor TP53 status impacts RPT responses and
tumor immunogenicity in immunocompetent mice. We will test the hypothesis that mutant TP53 interferes with
cGAS/STING/IFN signaling in RPT-treated tumors and reduces tumor immunogenicity. In Aim 3, we will
develop novel combination therapies that enhance or restore the cGAS/STING/IFN pathway in the mCRPC
immune tumor microenvironment and improve the magnitude and durability of RPT responses via increased
tumor immunogenicity.
Successful completion of these aims will identify new connections between mCRPC TP53 mutational status,
cytosolic DNA sensing mechanisms, and tumor immunogenicity that can be leveraged to increase the efficacy
of RPT against mCRPC through rationally designed and clinically applicable combination therapies."

To reduce racial disparities in Alzheimer’s disease related dementias (ADRD) for US Black and Latinx/a/o older

community-level policing (CLP), that Black and Latinx/a/o older adults have consistently encountered across
the life course from historical police-sanctioned lynchings during early life, to police-involved killings, arrests,

the relationship between early life adverse CLP exposure with incident dementia and accelerated biological
age after 50. Aim 3) Compare the effects of early and midlife adverse CLP exposure on objectively measured
memory performance in late life. These aims lay the groundwork for a R01 application exploring interventions
to the pathway from adverse CLP exposure to ADRD. Dr. Paris Adkins-Jackson’s long-term career goal is to
become an independent investigator that leads research that explicates the role of structural determinants like
structural racism on ADRD and multidimensional aging for historically marginalized groups like Black and
Latinx/a/o communities. She seeks a K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award to obtain critical
content area knowledge on ADRD, cognitive function, and biological aging to complement her expertise in
structural racism and psychological health, which will lead to an independently funded research program. Her
career development plan includes didactic courses and mentored research in ADRD, cognitive function, and
biological aging, and leadership in ADRD disparities research. This training will occur in the rich environment at
Columbia University, including the Mailman School of Public Health and the Gertrude H. Sergievsky Center at
Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Dr. Adkins-Jackson will receive guidance from an experienced
team with a strong track record of mentoring and funding in ADRD, cognitive function, biological aging, and
adverse CLP exposure—many of whom wrote seminal literature on structural racism and ADRD disparities.
Building on such work, this study determines the magnitude of a modifiable factor that may lead to
neurodegeneration and harmful aging."

10900738,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The development of tau positron emission tomography (PET) tracers has yielded the opportunity to better
understand the tau accumulation associated with the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), improve the
diagnostic accuracy of AD, and test the effects of therapeutic interventions in tau deposition. Our group and
others have shown that [18F]Flortaucipir has distribution patterns similar to those reported in postmortem studies
and shows significant rates of tau accumulation over time despite brain off-target signal in white matter, basal
ganglia, and choroid plexus. [18F]MK-6240, a second-generation tau tracer, has ~6-fold greater affinity for tau
tangles than [18F]Flortaucipir and negligible brain off-target signal. However, [18F]MK-6240 has off-target uptake
in the meninges adjacent to the entire cortex, which can compromise the signal within brain regions. We have
shown that [18F]MK-6240 has similar patterns of uptake as postmortem and [18F]Flortaucipir studies. However,
[18F]MK-6240 has a higher dynamic range and, although measured in different cohorts, the annual change in tau
using [18F]MK-6240 appears to be greater than changes measured using [18F]Flortaucipir. To date, more than
95% of sites in the US performing tau PET studies are using one of these tracers. Although both tracers offer
robust tau estimates, these large differences in binding characteristics between them can lead to misleading
interpretations of their outcomes and preclude the merging of their datasets using simple conversion methods.
Thus, a well-powered longitudinal study assessing head-to-head [18F]Flortaucipir and [18F]MK-6240 scans has
the potential to: (1) standardize their analysis, allowing datasets to be combined, (2) compare their rates of
longitudinal deposition to elucidate their advantages and limitations for research, trials, and practice, and (3)
produce a benchmark dataset to be used by the scientific community to develop methods for PET quantification
and harmonization. Here, we propose a multi-site longitudinal study in which 620 subjects (40 young controls,
280 cognitively unimpaired elderly, 200 mild cognitive impairment, 100 AD dementia) will receive [18F]Flortaucipir
and [18F]MK6240 scans at baseline and 18 months later. At each time point, subjects will also have an amyloid-
β (Aβ) PET scan, magnetic resonance imaging, cognitive tests, and a blood draw for plasma tau analyses.
Methods will be harmonized with ADNI and the ADRC program. In Aim 1, we will (1) standardize processing
methods, (2) convert to a common scale, (3) compare associations with Aβ, atrophy, and cognition, and (4)
compare Braak staging between tau tracers using cross-sectional data. In Aim 2, we will (1) ascertain the optimal
processing method for longitudinal analysis and (2) compare longitudinal accumulation between tau tracers and
its associations with changes in Aβ, atrophy, and cognition. As recent results from our group and others have
shown that the new p-tau plasma assays identify brain tau pathology, in exploratory Aim 3, we will compare
cross-sectional and longitudinal [18F]Flortaucipir and [18F]MK6240 estimates with plasma p-tau outcomes."
10879058,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is to provide highly focused and advanced training in the development, function and
dysfunction of the mammalian cerebral cortex at Yale University. The philosophy of this program is to preserve
and foster integrative approaches to neurobiology that will interface across genetics, molecular biology, cell
biology, systems neuroscience and clinical medicine with respect to the development, organization, function and
plasticity of the mammalian cortex. Twenty-seven (27) faculty from eleven (11) basic and clinical departments at
both Yale School of Medicine and Yale College are participants in this multidisciplinary program. The program
offers both depth and breadth. The depth derives from its unique substantive focus on cortical circuits of the
rodent, primate and human brain. The breadth of the program derives from the diversity of approaches, spanning
genetic, molecular, developmental, systems, theory and cognitive neuroscience. Faculty interests span cortical
morphogenesis and axon guidance mechanisms in embryos to memory decline and stroke in elderly humans.
Methodologies include deep sequencing; cloning; cell culture; immunocytochemistry; in situ hybridization;
electron and two photon microscopy; voltage clamp and whole cell recording; calcium and other forms of optical
imaging; biochemistry and molecular analyses; psycho-pharmacology; rodent, monkey and human behavior; in
vivo extracellular recording in behaving animals; and fMRI and PET imaging in human subjects. Four predoctoral
positions are requested. Trainees are selected by the Executive Committee from an outstanding pool of
advanced Neuroscience graduate students at Yale, which are amongst the best in the country and come from a
variety of backgrounds in biological and physical sciences. Trainees are selected on the basis of their potential
for excellence and leadership in research focused on the mammalian neocortex. Mentors are Ph.D.s and M.D.s.
with substantial NIH support and NINDS related research foci on the neurobiology of cortical systems, particularly
the development, function and dysfunction, including Alzheimer’s, Schizophrenia and Autism. Training includes
focused coursework, instruction in experimental design and statistical methods, aggressive mentorship through
advisory committees, intensive research apprenticeship, structured seminar programs, career skills
development, extensive oral and written feedback, and numerous opportunities for written and oral presentation
of research progress and analysis."
10861041,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This career development proposal will provide Blair Golden, MD MS, a physician-scientist at The University of
Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, with the training required for success as an
independent investigator researching interventions to improve the delivery of patient- and family-centered care
for hospitalized adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD).
Nearly half of all hospitalized patients with AD/ADRD develop delirium superimposed on dementia (DSD),
which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. DSD also leads to adverse impacts for family
caregivers, compounding pre-existing caregiver stresses and negative impacts on wellbeing. Despite its
substantial burden, DSD remains under-detected and poorly managed in hospitalized patients due in part to
under-developed approaches for assessing pre-existing impairment and other individual characteristics that
are critical to delivering tailored prevention strategies. Evidence-based programs for delirium have emphasized
the role of family engagement in recognition and management, but approaches to proactively engaging family
members and patients with AD/ADRD in DSD detection and prevention remain underdeveloped. The
overarching goal of this K23 proposal is to establish patient and family caregiver-centered communication and
engagement practices capable of proactively addressing information needs and soliciting participation in DSD
identification and prevention that are feasible and scalable. Understanding family and patient communication
and information needs regarding DSD could not only improve the delivery of patient and family-centered care,
but also potentially reduce family and patient suffering and improve DSD identification and prevention. As a
junior faculty member at an institution with extensive infrastructure to support early-stage investigators, Dr.
Golden is in an optimal environment to complete the proposed research project and pursue advanced training.
Her career development plan includes formal coursework, intensive mentorship, and experiential training in 1)
mixed methods, survey, and intervention mapping approaches 2) delirium assessment and prevention 3)
research engagement and clinical care of patients with AD/ADRD and 4) pragmatic clinical trial design. To
ensure success, she has identified expert mentors in these disciplines with outstanding track records in training
independent investigators and secured protected time for this work. This award addresses a significant clinical
dilemma and serious gap in AD/ADRD and delirium research while affording the education and mentored
research experience critical to prepare Dr. Golden to lead an independent research program."
10823286,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a critical need to develop high-throughput scalable assays to identify biological mechanisms underlying
risk genes in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD). In this proposal, we aim to leverage
the unique advantages of two scalable systems – human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and zebrafish
– to perform parallel functional assays of NPD genes in vitro and in vivo, and to pilot the development of
innovative spatial multi-omics technologies applicable across systems. We propose to establish an Assay and
Data Generation Center (ADGC) as part of the SSPsyGene Consortium that capitalizes on the unique and
complementary expertise of our labs in large-scale hiPSC CRISPR screens (Brennand), high-throughput
zebrafish screens (Hoffman), and cutting-edge multi-omics tool development (Fan). Our goal is to gain novel
insights into the convergent and divergent mechanisms by which diverse NPD gene loss of function
affects neurodevelopment at the molecular, cellular, structural, circuit, and behavioral levels. We propose
to screen 250 NPD genes using a tiered strategy in hiPSCs and zebrafish by conducting pooled and arrayed
transcriptomic and phenotypic screens in hiPSCs-derived neurons and glia (Aim 1), CRISPR screens in
zebrafish to assess the effects of gene loss of function on whole-brain structure, activity, and basic behaviors
(Aim 2), and spatial transcriptomic and multi-omic CRISPR screens to investigate the transcriptional effects of
NPD gene disruption in both systems (Aim 3). We will advance the field by identifying biologically relevant
phenotypes resulting from NPD gene loss of function across multiple scales, informing gene prioritization
schema, and establishing new spatial multi-omics platforms for the functional analysis of NPD genes. These
studies will generate an unprecedented resource of matched molecular, cellular, structural, circuit, and
behavioral data in hiPSCs and zebrafish, which will be provided for open distribution to the broader community
to yield new insights into NPD."

 Prolactinomas (PRL-omas), the most common secreting pituitary tumors, frequently cause
hypogonadism and subfertility. Although dopamine agonist therapy often works well initially and 1/3 of patients
experience long-term remission after 2 years of therapy, 1/3 of patients require long-term D2 agonist therapy to
maintain normal PRL levels and a further 1/3 of patients are either refractory to DA therapy or intolerant of their
side effects. Although surgical resection can be offered in some, remission rates in large locally invasive
tumors is <50%. Translational research has been hampered by the lack of any human PRL-oma cell models.
Using current methodologies, human PRL-oma cultures only survive for 7-10 days in vitro. There is an urgent
unmet need for establishment of a human PRL-secreting tumor model that retains its highly differentiated
phenotype and allows sufficient long-term expandability of cells for use in preclinical translational research and
development of novel treatment options. We compared the global transcriptome landscape in consecutive
passages from two human prolactin-secreting pituitary tumor primary cultures using bulk RNA-seq to
understand the molecular events leading to loss of hormone secretion during in vitro human prolactinoma
culture. As pituitary tumor cells lost hormone secretion, we observed a reduction in angiogenesis, survival
signals and immune responses in parallel with increased collagen catabolism, cell adhesion and extracellular
matrix organization. Guided by these findings, we developed a unique 3-dimensional (3D) PRL-oma culture
system and for the first time, we have generated long-term (> 6 months) expandible PRL-secreting 3D human
pituitary tumor cultures (>6 months).
 In the first of two aims, we will use our unique patient-derived 3D PRL-oma culture model in a high
throughput screen to identify small molecule inhibitors of PRL secretion and proliferation. We have already
demonstrated the feasability of this approach and identified a compound of interest in a pilot screen and now
wish to conduct an expanded HTS to identify novel therapies for patients with refractory PRL-omas. Our
primary screen will include pharmacological validation and repurposing-, targeted-, lead-like- and diverse-
libraries. Initial hits will be selected using robust z-score statistics and transitioned to aim 2 for further
development. Aim 2 will employ a cascade of follow-up assays to validate potential hit compounds. These will
include dose-response curves in both rat and human PRL-oma cells, assessment and exclusion of non-specific
overly toxic compounds. And tests of specificity on hormone secretion in various murine and human
neuroendocrine tumors. Additionally, in-silica target prediction will be combined with RNA-seq transcriptome
profiling to segregate drug target pathways and deconvolute the MOA of resultant hits. Finally, potential actions
of hits on identified pathway targets will be corroborated by pathway disruption using short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) and CRISPR libraries in both rat and human PRL-omas to define a group of first-in-class hits."

This project will complete a longitudinal data infrastructure including most of the U.S. population from 1940
through 2020. The linked infrastructure currently includes data from the censuses of 1940 and 2000-2020 and
will soon include data from the censuses of 1960-1990. The current project will incorporate the 1950 Census
and enhance the 1940 Census. These new data will provide the baseline observations for most of today’s oldest
Americans. When complete, the entire 1940-2020 infrastructure will serve as a massive multi-purpose resource
enabling a wide range of new discoveries and applications.
We will undertake three key tasks to accomplish this goal: (1) link 1950 Census respondents into the broader
infrastructure, (2) use new techniques to improve the coverage and accuracy of linkages currently available for
the 1940 Census respondents, and (3) use a restricted Social Security Administration file to add new information
on respondents’ exact date of birth, county of birth for those born in the U.S., and date of death for the deceased.
With our addition of linked cases from 1940 and 1950, population health researchers will be able to use these
data to analyze the life-course trajectories of hundreds of millions of Americans over the past century.
Researchers will be able to incorporate information on early-life and ancestral experiences—such as parental
economic status, childhood environmental exposures, policy conditions, social institutions, and neighborhood
characteristics—into investigations of the health, well-being, and mortality of Americans over their lives and
through generations."

Twenty years after 9/11, the World Trade Center (WTC) responders show elevated rates mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), an early sign of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or AD-related dementia (ADRD). MCI is often
regarded as an intermediate stage between normal aging and dementia; thus it provides a window of opportunity
to understand the pathogenesis of the disorder and identify factors that lead to the conversion of MCI to
dementia. Epigenetic vulnerability and gene-environment interactions have been implicated in the etiology of
ADRD. In particular, small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) have been shown to be promising biomarkers and
provide insights into its pathophysiology. Preliminary findings further revealed that monocyte subpopulation
showed the largest changes in transcriptome associated with MCI; in line with evidence that monocytes play a
pivotal role in mediating the interface between central and peripheral systems via transduction through the blood
brain barrier. Despite this, there is no study which has investigated the epigenetic regulation by sncRNAs in
monocyte subpopulation that may explain how these changes affect downstream gene expression and proteins
associated with AD neuropathy and disease progression. This proposal builds on the preliminary findings in
monocyte transcriptome and capitalizes on existing biobank and clinical data by evaluating monocyte sncRNA
via smRNA-seq in a subset of 100 responders over a 24-month period. The proposed study will determine if
changes in monocyte sncRNAs are associated with changes in clinical phenotype; and identify the gene targets
of sncRNAs in monocyte subpopulation associated with cerebral neuropathology. To enhance the impact of this
study, an exploratory aim is included to identify a multi-omic signature by integrating monocyte sncRNAs, mRNAs
and plasma proteins that predicts changes in clinical phenotype. This study would be the first to examine the
synergy between monocyte sncRNAs, mRNAs and plasma proteins in individuals converting to dementia.
Findings from this study will shed light on regulation of monocyte responses in disease progression, help identify
novel blood-based biomarkers that may inform treatment efforts."
10825566,"SUMMARY
Splicing is a critical biological process in cancer initiation and progression. In pancreatic cancer, few studies
have investigated the role of splicing regulators or their spliced targets in disease progression. Using a high-
throughput, genome-wide genetic screen in vivo for novel events promoting KRAS-driven pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we recently identified a unique role for the RNA splicing factor RBFOX2 as a latent
tumor suppressor driving disease progression. We showed RBFOX2 nuclear abundance is significantly
decreased in poorly differentiated human PDAC and that RBFOX2 depletion promotes a highly metastatic
disease in orthotopic models. We found RBFOX2 loss promotes exon skipping events associated with stem cell
potential and invasion, including ABI1. We hypothesize that RBFOX2-mediated splice-switching in key regulators
of cell invasion and differentiation programs is central to its role in promoting PDAC progression. In this proposal,
we will examine the oncogenic role of these RBFOX2-mediated splicing events in PDAC progression. In Aim 1,
we will investigate the oncogenic role(s) of the ABI1∆Ex9 isoform alternatively spliced by RBFOX2 using
proteomics approaches to elucidate novel protein interactions and secondary modifications contributing to
ABI1∆Ex9 function in driving invasive phenotypes. In Aim 2, we will investigate the contribution of “ESC-like”
exon exclusion events regulated by RBFOX2 to PDAC cell differentiation and disease progression using i) splice-
switching Anti-Sense Oligonucleotides (AONs) to mimic exon-skipped isoforms and investigate their
cooperativity in driving ex vivo stem cell-like phenotypes and ii) inducible cDNA isoforms to understand their role
in promoting disease progression in vivo. In Aim 3, we will develop an RBFOX2 splicing signature using PDXs
and PDOs from patients with rapid relapse and progression-free disease using state of the art splicing analysis
platforms (bulk and scRNAseq PacBio/isoseq coupled to Illumina short read sequencing) and investigate its
association with disease relapse. We expect that our study will reveal the biological relevance of the RBFOX2-
promoted oncogenic splicing program in pancreatic cancer progression and identify new molecular vulnerabilities
that can be harnessed to improve disease outcomes for pancreatic cancer patients."

 Although potent antifungal agents are currently available, invasive fungal infections remain
highly prevalent causes of disease and death, especially in our most vulnerable patients with defective
immune systems. AIDS, organ transplantation, and more aggressive cancer treatments all contribute to
ever-expanding patient groups who are at risk for these serious infections. Future directions in the
treatment of infectious diseases will increasingly involve identifying microbe-specific cellular processes
that can be targeted for intervention.
 In this proposal, we will study central signaling pathways in the human fungal pathogen
Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) that are induced in the setting of infection. We began studying the
fungal-specific Rim signaling pathway in Cn as a regulator of surface capsule expression and fungal
cell fitness. Using complementary transcriptomic, proteomic, and microbial genetic techniques, we have
defined Rim-dependent cellular events in this fungal pathogen that allow rapid microbial adaptation to
the host environment. Many of these adaptations occur specifically in response to the pH of the infected
host. Therefore, our studies not only address microbial pathogenesis, but they also explore central
ways in which eukaryotic cells sense and respond to this important environmental condition."

major research institution in Chicago."
10843817,"Project Summary
 The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR; NR1i3) is a well-established xenobiotic sensor that regulates the
expression of numerous genes encoding proteins important for drug metabolism and clearance. Accumulating
evidence suggests that CAR also plays noncanonical roles in coordinating diverse physiological and
pathophysiological responses associated with energy homeostasis and cell proliferation. Studies in rodents have
established activation of CAR as a key event promoting liver tumor formation. In contrast, CAR activation-
induced replicative DNA synthesis and hepatocyte proliferation in rodents were not observed in either cultured
human liver cells in vitro or in chimeric mice with humanized liver in vivo. Moreover, epidemiological studies have
shown that even after long-term clinical use, phenobarbital, a prototypical CAR activator, does not increase the
incidence of liver tumors in humans. Yet, the role of human CAR (hCAR) in hepatoma cell proliferation and liver
cancer development remains poorly understood. The overall objective of this application is to delineate the role
of hCAR in liver tumor progression and to develop a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms
underlying the effects of hCAR on hepatoma cell proliferation. To this end, we have shown that 1) expression of
hCAR was significantly lower in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to normal liver and, importantly,
hCAR expression is inversely correlated with HCC outcomes; 2) ectopic expression of the reference hCAR but
not a splicing variant isoform (hCAR3) in hepatoma cells markedly repressed cell proliferation, soft agar colony
formation, and the growth of hepatoma xenografts in nude mice; 3) RNA-seq analyses revealed that hCAR alters
the expression of a cluster of tumor suppressors and oncogenes including the downregulation of erythropoietin
(EPO), a pleiotropic growth factor that exhibits cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis functions; and 4) activation of
human and mouse CAR differentially alters the expression of cell proliferation genes in vivo. Based on these
exciting preliminary findings, we hypothesize that in stark contrast to its rodent counterparts, hCAR exhibits
anticancer functions that repress the progression of HCC by downregulating EPO. This central hypothesis will
be tested in two Specific Aims: Aim 1. Define the role of hCAR isoforms in hepatoma cell proliferation and HCC
progression; and Aim 2. Delineate the mechanisms by which hCAR represses HCC progression. Our findings
are expected to determine the role of hCAR in HCC development and provide novel mechanistic insights into
hCAR-mediated suppression of HCC progression that will open the door to novel biomarkers and therapeutics."

This project involves training peer-health coaches to improve the shared-decision making behavior of patients
with low-health literacy (LHL). Most patients want to be involved in important health decisions such as taking
medications to prevent cardiovascular disease. Yet, patients with LHL often lack the knowledge, confidence,
and skills to assume a more active role in these decisions. I am committed to conducting research that will
support patients with LHL in becoming equal partners with their clinicians. My commitment is evidenced in
this novel intervention that is designed to help LHL patients acquire the knowledge they need to engage in a
shared-decision about reducing their cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; and the agency and confidence they
need to do so. This study will provide a foundation for advancing the science of SDM around the primary
prevention of CVD with a focus on addressing LHL through trained peers.
Moreover, this proposed K-award will springboard to the next steps in my path to an independent investigator.
By the end of this award, I will develop expertise in understanding the scope of peers in the SDM process and
how they can be used to improve cardiovascular disease outcomes for patients with LHL. This award will span
5 years and will involve a graduated career development plan that includes mentorship, coursework, analyses,
publication, and an R-level grant submission. In order to achieve the goals of this research plan and transition
to independence, I need formal training and mentorship in implementation science, health literacy & patient
communication, and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. This proposal includes an exceptional team
of mentors to help me reach my goals. My primary mentor, Dr. Kevin Fiscella, is a nationally known expert in
health care disparities, implementation science, and health care policy. He is experienced in conducting equity-
focused primary prevention of cardiovascular disease implementation research in primary care. My Co-
Mentor, Dr. Ronald Epstein, is an internationally known expert in patient-provider communication. He is a
communication and health services researcher with a focus on pragmatic strategies for improving
communication with patients. My goal at the end of this award is to submit an NHLBI grant application (such
as in response to NHLBI PA-19-166 (Implementation of shared decision making for HLBS diseases and
conditions) to further refine and test the proposed intervention in a broader population."
10867323,"As pregnancy progresses, the oxygen and nutrient needs of the growing fetus increase. To accommodate these needs, adaptations occur at the uterine-placental interface. Early in pregnancy, trophoblast stem (TS) cells differentiate and invade into the uterine tissue to facilitate remodeling of uterine spiral arteries. Abnormal placenta development with insufficient trophoblast invasion leads to pregnancy disorders including early pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and pre-term birth. The failure of invasive trophoblast cell transformation of the uterus and especially the uterine vasculature is the causative event leading to these devastating obstetrical complications. However, we know little about the mechanisms underlying development of the invasive trophoblast cell lineage. The underlying premise of our research approach is that conservation exists in the regulation of placentation. We utilize the rat as a model because unlike other species, including the mouse, the rat exhibits deep intrauterine trophoblast cell invasion similar to the human. Human TS cells have recently been isolated and propagated in vitro and can be manipulated to differentiate into invasive trophoblast, which in the human are referred to as extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cells. Human TS cells are an excellent model for investigating molecular mechanisms regulating trophoblast cell differentiation. Our long-range goal is to identify conserved regulators controlling differentiation of the invasive trophoblast cell lineage. In a preliminary study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of the rat uterine-placental interface to identify candidate regulators of the invasive trophoblast cell lineage. We identified cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (CDKN1C) as a conserved transcript uniquely expressed in invasive trophoblast cells of the rat and human. CDKN1C is a key regulator of cell proliferation, endoreduplication, and differentiation in several developmental systems. In Aim 1, a loss-of-function approach will be used to investigate the involvement of CDKN1C in human TS cell differentiation into the invasive EVT cell lineage. We will examine structural, transcriptomic, and functional processes impacted by CDKN1C. In Aim 2, we utilize a loss-of-function rat model to examine the role of CDKN1C in the physiological context of placentation. This project will be completed at the University of Kansas Medical Center (KUMC) under the guidance of Dr. Michael J Soares and a mentoring team of outstanding biomedical scientists. A training plan has been formulated to facilitate the development of technical proficiencies and critical thinking skills necessary to devise and execute experimentation that effectively addresses a meaningful biological question. The Soares Laboratory, the Institute for Reproduction and Perinatal Research, and the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at KUMC represent a rich scientific environment that will provide outstanding graduate training and a research opportunity to gain new insights into the regulation of the invasive trophoblast cell lineage and the establishment of the uterine-placental interface."
10850944,"ABSTRACT
Affective symptoms are a common feature of neuropsychiatric disorders that reflect dysfunction in a distributed
brain network that supports emotion. How aberrant functioning in a single emotion network underlies a wide
range of affective symptoms, such as depression and anxiety, is not well understood. Anchored by the anterior
cingulate cortex and ventral anterior insula, the emotion network responds to numerous affective stimuli. A more
sophisticated understanding of how the emotion network produces emotions—and how atypical emotion network
functioning relates to affective symptoms—will be critical for advancing current neuroanatomical models of
neuropsychiatric disorders. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) provides direct estimates of neuronal
populations and can be used to map the spatiotemporal dynamics of the emotion network at a millisecond-level
resolution. Although functional neuroimaging studies have uncovered little evidence for neural differentiation
among emotions, these studies lack the spatiotemporal and spectral resolution to determine whether emotions
are characterized by unique neural signatures. The overall goals of the proposed project are to elucidate how
emotion network dynamics relate to the behavioral, autonomic, and experiential changes that accompany
emotions and to investigate how emotion network dysfunction relates to affective symptoms. Anatomically-
specific biomarkers of emotion network dysfunction could be used to guide development of novel treatments,
monitor symptoms and treatment response, and improve animal models of affective symptoms. We will study
100 patients with intractable epilepsy undergoing surgery for seizure localization. Subjects with iEEG electrodes
within the emotion network will undergo continuous neural and video recordings during a multi-day hospital stay.
Naturalistic affective behaviors that subjects display spontaneously throughout their hospitalization, emotional
reactivity in response to standardized affective stimuli, and emotional reactions following electrical stimulation of
emotion network hubs will be quantified. We will examine how activity within emotion network hubs changes
during emotions and how emotion network properties make some individuals more vulnerable to affective
symptoms than others. We will address three key aims. In Aim 1, we will determine how emotion network activity
relates to naturalistic affective behaviors. In Aim 2, we will uncover the unique neural signatures of discrete
emotions and their relations to task-based measures of emotional reactivity. In Aim 3, we will probe whether
electrical stimulation of emotion network hubs changes network activity and alters emotions, mood, and anxiety.
By utilizing a multidisciplinary approach, the proposed project has the potential to ask novel questions about the
neural origins of emotions and to advance current models of the neurobiological basis of emotions and affective
symptoms."
10813138,"Pro-tumorigenic roles of a VHL isoform in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.
 Kidney cancer or renal cell carcinoma (RCC), is presently the ninth most prevalent
neoplasm in the United States. Its incidence has more than doubled in the developed world over
the past couple decades and is projected to increase in burden worldwide. The most common
subtype of RCC is clear cell RCC (ccRCC), accounting for nearly 80% of all cases. Of note,
ccRCCs lack common genetic abnormalities observed in many other human cancers, thus
impeding the use of more standard treatment regimens by targeted therapies. Greater than 90%
of ccRCC tumors exhibit mutations in the VHL (von Hippel-Lindau) gene. The VHL tumor
suppressor gene encodes three different protein isoforms: pVHL213, pVHL160 and pVHL172.
pVHL172, an isoform lacking exon 2, is a naturally occurring VHL splice variant, that was recently
characterized as lacking tumor suppressor function and having no effect on HIF expression or
function unlike the other VHL isoforms, and effectively promoting tumorigenesis in xenograft
ccRCC mouse models. Here, to better understand the cellular basis VHL172-driven ccRCC, we
propose a set of self-contained studies to investigate paracrine signaling by VHL172 tumor cells.
Based on robust preliminary data, we hypothesize that extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from
ccRCC tumors play a key role in the induction of pro-tumorigenic phenotypes. EVs harness
select molecular entities—proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, and deliver these cargoes to
recipient cells in the tumor microenvironment. We will test our hypothesis and subsequently
leverage this work to investigate the role of EVs in preclinical models of ccRCC. These
investigations will not only provide new information on EV-mediated intercellular communication
in ccRCC, but also new therapeutic avenues to target patients diagnosed with this kidney
cancer subtype."

 The proposed 5-year study uses a causally interpretable research design to examine the effects of the Sit
Together and Read (STAR) early-literacy intervention on the short- and long-term literacy skills of young
children with developmental language disorder (DLD). It also examines the use of caregiver-directed behavior-
change strategies as a means to support caregivers’ implementation of the intended treatment strength. STAR
is a fully manualized intervention that significantly improves the early-literacy skills and longer-term reading
outcomes of children at-risk for future reading difficulty. The proposed study is instrumental in assessing
longitudinal impacts for children with DLD and identifying ways to enhance caregiver implementation of the key
intervention ingredients.
 The study features four planned variations with each involving 80 caregiver-child dyads (total N = 320,
80 per condition). Two planned variations allow examination of the main effects of STAR for children with DLD,
with 80 caregivers assigned to implement STAR for a 15-week period as compared to an untreated control.
The outcomes of interest for these variations are children’s short-term print-knowledge development, literacy
trajectories to two-years post-intervention, and reading-difficulty status. Two additional planned variations allow
examination of effects of caregiver-directed behavior-change strategies (rewards and encouragement) on
STAR implementation as compared to caregivers who do not receive any change strategies. The outcomes of
interest for these variations are caregivers’ implementation of the intended treatment strength as well as
mediated effects on children’s literacy outcomes. Child outcomes are based on direct assessments of literacy
skills captured at six time-points, from study baseline to two-years’ post-intervention; assessors are blind to
condition. Caregiver implementation is captured via logged sessions on a bespoke app as well as analyses of
audiotaped sessions submitted via the app.
 Directional hypotheses are threefold. First, we hypothesize that children whose caregivers implement
STAR will show significantly greater print-knowledge gains over the 15-week intervention period, and
accelerated literacy trajectories through first grade. We speculate that STAR exposure will also significantly
reduce the rate of reading difficulty among children. Second, we hypothesize that children whose caregiver
implement STAR and receive one of two behavior-change strategies will show significantly greater intensity
and dosage of implementation relative to those not receiving these strategies. Third, we hypothesize
significantly greater print-knowledge gains and literacy trajectories for children of caregivers receiving
behavior-change strategies, and that these effects are partially or fully mediated by intervention intensity and/or
dose."

Prostate cancer affects nearly 1 in 7 men in the United States yet the diagnosis of early aggressive cancer
remains elusive at the expense of many unnecessary biopsies, delay in diagnosis from biopsy sampling error,
or the diagnosis of indolent disease. In order make a diagnose clinically significant prostate cancer, there is an
urgent need find an imaging modality that can be implemented uniformly, yet also provide clinical utility. MRI-
guided prostate biopsy has rapidly become a common modality to perform prostate biopsy; however, limited
emphasis has been placed on the quality and accuracy of the image acquisition.
Our proposal supports an academic-industry partnership to develop and imaging biomarker that could
revolutionize how prostate cancer is diagnosed and monitored by using restriction spectrum imaging (RSI)-MRI.
We seek to improve the operating characteristics of prostate MRI with a novel, non-invasive method of a short-
duration, targeted magnetic RSI-MRI sequences then undergo FDA-cleared, class II post-processing software
(OnQ Prostate) to attribute values to suspicious areas of the prostate. RSI-MRI employs multiple b-value
acquisitions with multiple diffusion gradient directions at each b-value to acquire raw data; images are post-
processed to isolate the signal from isotropic, restricted water compartments typically found in cancer cells. A
resultant “restricted signal map” corresponding to tumor location is derived and quantified functioning as an in
vivo biomarker of tumor grade and enhances tumor conspicuity for reader detection. In Aim 1, weseek to validate
our previous findings regarding the operating characteristics of the RSM values and its association with clinically
significant prostate cancer (grade group 2 or higher). We will use a non-randomized, single arm clinical trial to
investigate both PI-RADS scores with and without the RSM values. In Aim 2, we see to calibrate the RSM map
values across manufacturers(Siemens, GE, and Phillips MRI scanners). We will use a two-scan approach which
will invite a sample of men with a range of PI-RADS values to undergo a research reference scan after they have
undergone their standard of care scan within one of three locations housing a specific MRI vendor. The two
scans will be compared and used to calibrate the RSM values using several calibration and normalization
techniques with targeted biopsy results. In some men that do undergo prostatectomy, we will further make a
mold of the prostate using the preoperative MRI then perform whole-mount sectioning, scanning, and alignment
with RSI-MRI to obtain accurate reads of normal and cancer areas. In Aim 3, we will compare RSM to currently
available FDA-approved biomarkers and clinical risk to determine clinical utility.
In the proposed project, we seek to improve specificity of prostate MRI using RSI. Specific deliverables will
include the ability to amend the standard radiological reporting system (PI-RADS) withspecific RSM output vales.
We seek to validate the restricted signal maps between vendors and provide clinical assessment tools
demonstrating a measurement of clinical utility."

Over 1,000 genes have been implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but only a handful have been
confirmed as causing phenotypes related to ASD in animal models. Understanding if and how each gene
contributes to ASD-related phenotypes singly or in combination is not feasible with rodent models, which
require enormous time, expense, and labor to generate and characterize. We have previously leveraged the
nematode C. elegans as a minimum in vivo animal model to quickly characterize genes related to human
neurological conditions. ------ C. elegans displays phenotypes with relevance to ASD including social behaviors
represented by how they tend to clump together in piles while eating. To quickly gain insight into whether 109
SFARI gene orthologs play a role in social behaviors in C. elegans, rather than study one mutant at a time, we
studied a collection of genetically distinct wild-type strains isolated from around the world. Each strain carries a
distinct combination of variants in these 109 ASD risk genes. We discovered that overall, the number and
severity of mutations in ASD risk genes correlated with decreased social behaviors. Moreover, we found that
mutations in certain ASD risk genes appear to cause social deficits, because we could boost social behaviors
by replacing defective ASD risk genes with functional versions. We also found that mutations in orthologs of
genes that cause increased social behavior in C. elegans have already been implicated in positively modifying
social behavior in ASD and Williams syndrome. The central hypothesis is that C. elegans will be a rapid and
inexpensive model organism to determine which combinations of mutations in this vast number of risk genes
cause ASD-related defects. The overall goal is to determine which mutations and combinations of mutations in
ASD risk genes cause ASD-relevant behaviors, and by what mechanisms. The rationale is that there is an
urgent need to understand the in vivo consequences of mutations in genes implicated in autism. The central
hypothesis will be tested with three specific aims: 1) Identify which and how natural variants in ASD risk genes
causally contribute to decreasing social behaviors and sensory integration in C. elegans. 2) Test which and
how variants in ASD risk genes positively modify social behaviors and sensory integration in C. elegans. 3)
Determine the mechanism by which genetic variants of uncertain significance identified in ASD patients
influence social and sensory integration behaviors and neurobiology of C. elegans. ------ The research
proposed in this application is innovative because it uses a minimalist animal model to perform high-throughput
in vivo causal functional analyses of ASD risk genes. The work is significant because it will allow researchers
working with rodents and human patients to focus their efforts on the most promising ASD risk genes. The
results will empower families to understand how patient-specific mutations in unstudied or under-studied ASD
risk genes influence basic neurobiology. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to guide the
development of future pharmacological and genetic treatments for the symptoms of ASD."

Every year 10 million people fall ill with tuberculosis (TB) and 1.5 million people die from TB – making it the
leading cause of death from infectious disease – but TB can be difficult to diagnose. Extended M. tuberculosis
(Mtb) cultures are still often used for diagnosis. PCR-based assays (e.g. Xpert MTB/RIF) that detect TB DNA
can provide more rapid results, but require special equipment and, like Mtb culture, exhibit reduced sensitivity
when employed to analyze sputum from individuals with extrapulmonary TB or compromised immune systems.
Blood-based TB assays should detect all forms of TB, but current tests analyze the immune response to Mtb
antigens and cannot distinguish active and latent TB. Sensitive detection of Mtb-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA)
in the circulation, however, represents a potential new means for enhanced TB diagnosis. Circulating cfDNA is
rapidly degraded after its release and disease-associated cfDNA levels in blood can rapidly change in response
to pathologic changes and physiologic responses. This short half-life can enable “real-time” cfDNA analyses
required for accurate evaluation of the current status of active Mtb infections and rapid granular evaluation of
Mtb treatment responses. However, the limit of detection (LoD) of current PCR-based assays are not sufficient
to reliably detect Mtb cfDNA in blood. We have established a CRISPR-Cas12a-based detection system that can
ultra-sensitively detect trace amount of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in blood to diagnose COVID-19, predict disease
severity, and evaluate infection resolution. We have adapted this approach to develop a blood-based multiplexed
CRISPR-mediated TB diagnosis (CRISPR-TBD) assay that can detect circulating Mtb cfDNA, including SNPs
responsible for drug-resistant TB. Our preliminary data from longitudinal serum samples of patients undergoing
TB treatment provide strong proof-of-principle evidence for the clinical utility of this platform. We have adapted
this approach to a paper strip-based point of care (POC) CRISPR-TBD detection platform suitable for use in
resource-limited regions with high TB burden, without decreasing assay sensitivity. We now propose to: 1)
systematically optimize all CRISPR-TBD paper strip assay steps to improve quantitative detection of Mtb-cfDNA
in POC settings; 2) evaluate the performance of this POC assay to diagnose pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB
and to identify drug-sensitive and -resistant TB cases; 3) quantify Mtb-cfDNA changes in serum during TB
treatment as a measure of treatment efficacy or failure and for early detection of nascent drug resistance; and
4) in-field validate the diagnostic performance of this POC assay in an independent TB patient cohort when
performed in a clinical laboratory in a high endemic TB region and evaluate in parallel the performance our
predictive Mtb-cfDNA model for TB treatment."
10816458,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Developing new anticancer drugs has been very slow and costly. A major reason is that the commonly used
2D cancer cells and animal models for drug discovery today are very different from the 3D tumors in human
patients. Lately, 3D tumor models have been made by suspending tumor cells in medium to form multicellular
spheroids/organoids, growing the cells in hydrogels/scaffolds, and incorporating blood vessels. However, little
has been done to build 3D vascularized tumor models for recapitulating the drug resistance in patient tumors.
 We recently developed a novel multiscale hydrogel biomaterials-based bottom-up strategy to control the
formation of the two distinct tissue domains in tumors - a 3D vascular network and an avascular/intervascular
tumor cell-containing region, for studying cancer drug resistance. This is achieved by producing 3D avascular
micro-tumors (µtumors) first and using them as the building blocks for assembling with endothelial cells (ECs)
under dynamic perfusion culture, to form 3D vascularized tumors with a complex 3D vascular network that
mimics the vascular-intervascular organization of in vivo tumors. Importantly, our data show quantitatively for
the first time that, the 3D vascularized tumors are much more drug resistant than 3D avascular µtumors,
indicating tumor blood vessels not only transport nutrients/oxygen but also enhance cancer drug resistance.
 However, no 3D vascularized tumor was built in vitro with cells differentiated from cancer stem cells (CSCs)
for drug discovery, although the rare CSCs have been posited to possess the exclusive ability of tumorigenesis
and be responsible for the many failures of cancer chemotherapy due to their high drug resistance. Moreover,
no CSCs isolated with contemporary methods are shown to differentiate into a type of cells that are not in
tumors. This cross-tissue multilineage differentiation is a key property of stem cells (e.g., adipose-derived stem
cells can differentiate into osteoblasts that are absent in fat). Thus, a method for isolating true CSCs is in need.
 We recently developed a novel core-shell hydrogel biomaterials-based approach for isolating CSCs by
culturing one (1) single cancer cell (from a cell line) in the nanoliter hydrogel core of microcapsules that mimic
pre-hatching embryos, where totipotent-pluripotent stem cells are cultured in human body. Importantly, the
isolated CSCs are capable of endothelial, cardiac, neural, and osteogenic differentiations and highly tumorigenic,
metastatic, and drug resistant, indicating the cells isolated with our bioinspired 1-cell culture are truly CSCs.
 In this project, we propose to further develop the novel bioinspired approach for isolating CSCs from breast
tumors of human patients. In view of the highly drug resistant nature of the CSCs isolated with our bioinspired
1-cell culture and their ability of differentiating into ECs in vivo that may reduce patient survival, we further
propose to use the CSC-derived ECs and cancer cells for building 3D vascularized tumors, to better model the
drug resistance in patient tumors than existing 3D vascularized tumors made using non-CSC cancer cells and
non-CSC (and often non-cancer-related) ECs (e.g., human umbilical vein endothelial cells known as HUVECs)."

 The objective of this proposal is to create a multi-modal feedback-based navigation system and MR-
compatible robotic platform that enables precise, continuous, and permanent lesion creation during MR-guided
radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for atrial fibrillation (AF) treatment. This research is motivated by the high
incidence of AF in US (1 in 100 people), and the suboptimal treatment outcome of traditional approaches (~30-
50% recurrence rate). Recurrence of AF occurs when there are gaps between ablation lesions, which can be
caused by multiple reasons, including 1) limited ability to manipulate the catheter in a manner that reaches all
desired ablation targets while also 2) maintaining proper catheter-tissue contact force (CTCF) for effective
ablation energy delivery. In addition, there is 3) lack of effective navigation methods that accurately identify sites
of incomplete ablation and guide the catheter to complete ablation. We recently developed MR-tracked
catheterization toolset to perform RFA inside MRI scanner and the MR-based imaging method to assess the
lesion outcome intraoperatively. However, manipulating the catheter towards the desired location and
maintaining proper contact remains a challenging task. To address these problems, we propose to develop an
MR-enabled intraoperative navigation feedback framework and robotic hardware system. From technical
perspective, the proposed platform is innovative since current systems do not integrate accurate catheter
manipulation and CTCF feedback with MRI-based monitoring and lesion assessment to provide a unified system
for AF ablation planning, treatment, and assessment. From the clinical perspective, the proposed platform
enables accurate catheter position and contact force control, which supports the creation of continuous and
chronic ablation lesions for reducing arrhythmia recurrence. The proposed work will be achieved via three Aims.
Aim 1: Navigation feedback. We will further develop navigation software that combines multi-modal sensory
feedback (i.e., MR imaging, MR-catheter tracking, CTCF estimation), and visualizes them in an integrated
software environment to provide feedback to the physician. Aim 2: MRI robot hardware and control. We will
advance our current catheter robot hardware to create a complete system for simultaneous catheter and guiding
sheath manipulation. We will develop hybrid position and CTCF control algorithm that enables accurate and
stable catheter placement for effective ablation energy delivery. Specific Aim 3: Experimental validations. We
will integrate the robot hardware and navigation feedback system, and validate the integrated system first in a
beating heart emulating phantom in a 1.5 MRI scanner, and then in 16 MR-guided LA ablation studies on swine."

How do we perceive the three-dimensional (3D) movement of objects in the world when our eyes only sense
two-dimensional (2D) projections like a movie on a screen? Accurate and precise perception of 3D object motion
is essential to intercept objects (e.g., catch a ball) and evade others (e.g., dodge a passing bicyclist). The goal
of this proposal is to elucidate the cortical networks that transform ambiguous 2D retinal signals into high-level
3D object-motion representations. To achieve this goal, we will utilize a synergistic combination of behavioral,
electrophysiological, and causal manipulation approaches with macaque monkeys. In Aim 1, we will distinguish
2D retinal motion selectivity from 3D object-motion selectivity at the single neuron level and evaluate functional
correlations with behavior. We will test the hypothesis that 3D object-motion representations are created within
a cortical network consisting of the middle temporal area (MT), the fundus of the superior temporal sulcus (FST),
and the lateral subdivision of the medial superior temporal sulcus (MSTl). The experiments will combine a 3D
object-motion discrimination task with simultaneous high-density neuronal recordings from all three areas.
Importantly, the stimulus set was rigorously vetted through previous perceptual and computational studies, and
maximally discriminates 2D retinal vs. 3D object-motion representations. This work will be the first to assess
functional correlations between neuronal activity and the behavioral discrimination of 3D object-motion. To
evaluate the cortical network organization of MT, FST, and MSTl, we will compare the areas’ functional properties
and measure the Granger causal influences between them using simultaneously recorded local field potentials.
In Aim 2, we will apply a complementary approach to assess the causal contributions of each area to 3D motion
perception. Specifically, we will use electrical microstimulation (EM) with weak currents to manipulate neuronal
activity while the monkeys perform the 3D object-motion discrimination task. These experiments will be the first
to use EM to causally probe the relationship between neuronal activity and 3D object-motion perception.
Critically, the predicted relationship between neuronal response properties at the site of EM and the induced
behavioral biases depends on whether the stimulated neurons are either: (i) selective for 2D retinal motion (with
outputs that are used by downstream neurons to compute 3D object-motion, otherwise no effect of EM would be
expected) or (ii) selective for 3D object-motion. We will test the predictions locally (i.e., at the level of individual
neurons within each area) to assess area-specific functional heterogeneity and globally (i.e., between areas) to
assess hierarchical differences across the network. The proposed experiments will together explicate differences
in the functional properties of three interconnected cortical areas as well as their causal contributions to 3D
motion perception. By elucidating the cortical networks that transform 2D retinal signals into ecologically relevant
representations of 3D object-motion, insights from this work will facilitate future studies that explore how neuronal
representations of dynamic, object-level information support interactions with the 3D world."

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects 8-10 million people in the US. Clinical trials evaluating stem cell, growth
factor, or gene therapy systems for the treatment of PAD have shown some promising results. Use of biomaterial
matrices either to enhance therapies or as a standalone treatment are just beginning to be explored in small
animal models of PAD, with promising findings indicating that a biomaterial strategy can enhance the efficacy of
intramuscular cell therapies in treating the effects of leg ischemia. There are important requirements for optimal
delivery, retention, and performance of a bioengineered composite in the mechanically, histologically, and
biochemically dynamic intramuscular environment of the PAD leg. The material should: (a) undergo minimal
swelling once inside the target tissue; (b) have proper mechanical properties with high resilience to tolerate
repeated compressive strain during muscle contraction for its long-term intramuscular retention; (c) be porous
enough to facilitate the exchange of trophic factors with the surrounding environment and to permit recruitment
of host progenitor and endothelial cells; and (d) have antioxidative and angiogenic properties that can be
beneficial to the management of the myopathy of PAD.
The objective of the current proposal is to characterize and optimize a biomaterial-based treatment for PAD. We
have recently developed an injectable, angiogenic, nanofiber-hydrogel composite with unique interfacial bonding
between the hydrogel matrices and the fibers, and successfully applied the composite for the regeneration of
soft tissue defects in a rabbit model. We have further modified the hydrogel to have antioxidant properties with
minimal swelling and optimized mechanical characteristics to mimic skeletal muscle. Testing in a rat model of
PAD, the hydrogel reduced lipid oxidation, enhanced local blood flow in the muscle, and improved running
capacity of the treated rats. In addition, we have developed and validated a porcine model of hindlimb ischemia
(iliofemoral artery ligation/excision), which recapitulates key aspects of the pathophysiology of human
PAD/claudication and can be a platform for the development of therapies for PAD. We are now primed to develop
and test our novel therapies for PAD in our porcine model.
We have all of the tools in place to address the central hypothesis that a nanofiber-hydrogel composite with
optimized mechanical, angiogenic, and antioxidative characteristics will improve hemodynamic,
histologic, and physiological endpoints of the ischemic hindlimb in rat and porcine models of PAD.
Successful completion of this project will deliver the first off-the-shelf synthetic composite matrix for the treatment
of PAD patients. As providing local therapy for the ischemic leg is critical to prevent myopathy and to improve
the performance of the affected lower limbs in PAD patients, this study will provide an important advancement
over other currently available treatments for PAD. The composite developed in this project can also be readily
applied to treat other disease entities, including skeletal and possibly heart muscle pathologies related to
ischemia/reperfusion, trauma, infection, and inflammation."

Breast cancer is a second leading cause of cancer death in women, exceeded only by lung cancer. Among the
different subtypes, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) that does not express the estrogen receptor,
progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, is characterized by poor prognostic
outcomes. TNBC forms solid tumors with high interstitial fluid pressure (IFP). High IFP promotes tumor
progression several ways and cancer immunotherapies are also compromised in TNBC tumors with high IFP
since the interstitial pressure keeps immune cells from infiltrating into tumors. While solid stress formed by fibrotic
tumor extracellular matrix contributes to tumor IFP formation, hyperpermeable blood vessels, combined with
compromised lymphatic drainage, lead to high IFP. To decrease tumor IFP, researchers have tried to reduce
solid stress and normalize leaky blood vessels in tumors. However, how lymphatic drainage is impaired in tumor
microenvironment and how the impaired lymphatic function affects tumor IFP, immune cell interactions, and anti-
tumor immunity are still ambiguous. Several studies have reported that lymphatic vessels (LVs) are structurally
and functionally impaired in tumors, and lymphangiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC)
treatment inhibited tumor growth by promoting lymphangiogenesis and boosting T cell recruitment to the tumors.
However, VEGFC has also been recognized to promote lymph node metastasis. Given the conflicting effects of
VEGFC, the main goals of this project are to normalize lymphatic drainage in TNBC without using VEGFC or
without promoting lymphangiogensis, by deciphering the mechanisms of lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) junction
remodeling in TNBC. In this proposal, we will use physiologically responsive in vitro 3D systems of lymphatic
vessels co-cultured with breast cancer cells, which can recapitulate lymphatic structure, lymphatic drainage, and
immune cell interactions in breast cancer. With these organotypic 3D model systems, we will examine lymphatic
junction morphogenesis and drainage in TNBC in the context of a tissue-like and in vivo environment, examine
LEC junction zippering in TNBC-associated LECs, evaluate the roles of lymphatic function in dendritic cell
trafficking to lymphatics, T cell activation, and T cell infiltration in tumors; and assess the roles of LEC junction
zippering for anti-tumor immunity. If successful, our studies will not only identify new targets to treat breast cancer,
but also provide a new tool for mechanism studies and fast screening of potential drug candidates to treat cancer
and lymphatic disease."

There are over 200 viruses known to infect humans and they contribute to 6.6% of global mortality. We have
approximately 91 drugs for 10 viral species and vaccines for only 16. Reassortment and antigenic changes pose
challenges to vaccine efficacy; this has clearly been demonstrated during the COVID pandemic. Current drug
development is focused on small molecules and neutralizing antibodies, which require high doses or frequent
re-dosing to obtain functional outcomes and have also been challenged by antigenic changes. Thus, it is crucial
to address the need for higher efficiency and broader spectrum antivirals. To address this need we are proposing
an entirely different paradigm for antiviral development, an mRNA-encoded activatable RNase, Cas13, as a
platform for a pan-respiratory treatment. Cas13 represents a programmable RNase that can directly target and
degrade multiple viral messenger or genomic RNA. Synthetic mRNA is being used to deliver the RNase, as it
allows for transient, non-viral delivery, with an improved safety profile over other gene therapy vectors1. Given
achieving pan-respiratory results with a single mRNA-encoded Cas13 based drug is not trivial, critical steps
towards that goal can be achieved by focusing on the three most impactful respiratory viruses in circulation,
RSV, influenza and SARS-CoV-2. To date, our team was the first to demonstrate efficacy of mRNA-encoded
Cas13 in vitro and in vivo via nebulizer-based lung delivery against influenza in the mouse model and SARS-
CoV-2 in the hamster model in our recent publication in Nature Biotechnology. In order to achieve one drug for
RSV, influenza and SARS-CoV-2 there are important questions/challenges that will need to be met. Thus, we
will determine the optimal Cas13 species for multiple respiratory pathogens and investigate the mechanism of
action of Cas13 for each virus. We will also demonstrate single drug efficacy against RSV, influenza and SAR-
CoV-2 in vivo in mouse and hamster models, given as treatments for the individual viral infections, during co-
infection (influenza and SAR-CoV-2), and to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2."

Dengue viruses (DENV) cause a significant and unchecked burden of human death and disease, with vaccine
development hindered by critical gaps in our understanding of how multi-serotypic protection against DENV is
generated, sustained, and subsequently identified in immunological assays. As the greatest risk for severe
dengue illness occurs with secondary infection, DENV vaccines will need to generate protection against at
least two serotypes simultaneously to maximize efficacy and safety. Our prior studies have demonstrated that
durable, multi-typic immunity can be achieved naturally, through sequential exposures accumulated over time
in hyperendemic areas for DENV transmission. Accordingly, our objective is to define the impacts of a child’s
earliest flavivirus exposures in shaping DENV humoral immune phenotypes and clinical outcomes of subse-
quent DENV exposures, generating important benchmarks for immune correlates of protection.
To address this objective, we will leverage an ongoing long-term multigenerational family cohort study for
DENV transmission in Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand. The cohort was established in 2015, leveraging NIH P01
and US DOD funds, and has enrolled over 3000 individuals within 500 families. 432 primary DENV infections
have been identified among 814 DENV-naïve children to date, with more to be identified by the end of the
study period in 2028 and marking 13 years of continuous surveillance. Incident infections are identified through
quarterly sampling to detect seroconversions and through active surveillance for acute dengue illnesses. We
will relate levels of maternally-transferred immunity, through placental transfer and breastfeeding, to risks of
dengue illness with primary DENV infection in 750 mother-infant dyads (including 500 previously-enrolled and
250 newly-enrolled dyads) (Aim 1). Next, we will continue our long-term follow-up of DENV-naïve children and
identify isotype- and antigen-specific DENV antibody phenotypes associated with protection from illness with
post-primary DENV infection (Aim 2). Finally, we will relate non-DENV flavivirus exposures (Japanese enceph-
alitis virus [JEV] vaccination, Zika virus infection, JEV infection) to risks of subsequent dengue illness, defining
effects of time since exposure, pre-infection antibody phenotypes, and JEV vaccine type (Aim 3).
These activities are consistent with NIAID’s mission to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent infec-
tious diseases. The application is innovative in using a custom multiplex panel for profiling DENV antibodies in
saliva, permitting frequent longitudinal sampling, and in using advanced modeling techniques to reconstruct
immune kinetics and identify subclinical infections. Successful completion of study aims will represent an im-
portant advancement towards identifying immune correlates of durable, multi-serotypic protection against den-
gue illness, providing critical benchmarks for diagnostics, triage, and DENV vaccines and immuno-therapies."

The chromosome 18 cohort with hemizygous deletions of chromosome 18 who manifest a multitude of

Program (GMKF) (Project number (HD107271-01). This cohort, with known and varied genetic contributors to
those birth defects, will contribute valuable data toward understanding the underlying molecular gene
contributors of a variety of a number of structural birth defects. However, our current phenotypic database
lacks important details about the associated endophenotypes and the outcomes of any treatments. We have a
wealth of data in the existing scanned medical records, survey and questionnaire answers and from our on-site
clinical evaluation records. Additionally we have longstanding relationships with the participating families and
can follow up to verify, get new details, and clarify information. We propose to expand the scope of the curated
data elements, map Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to those data elements thereby increasing the
value of the data available to the research community. Our plan to enhance the depth and scope of the
phenotype data is to first reevaluate all the existing records adding additional data elements where necessary
to the database. This evaluation will generate a report for the families detailing the information we have and the
dates the information was gathered. We will ask the families for any updated information focusing on
evaluation and treatment outcomes for any of the structural birth defects as well as any cancer diagnoses. The
enhanced dataset will be standardized by the mapping of the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to the
data elements. The outcome of this project will be to increase the accessibility and quality of these data to the
broader research community as these phenotype data are integrated with the genomic data generated by the
GMKF program."
10880296,"Background: Disparities in pain treatment suggest that Veterans of color and women Veterans (i.e., “diverse
Veterans” in this CDA) are subject to unequal treatment when seeking pain care at VA. Mounting evidence
points to the importance of guideline-concordant, evidence-based non-pharmacological pain treatments
(NPTs) in the management of chronic pain, yet these treatments are not reaching diverse Veterans.
Implementation mapping can be used to rigorously plan implementation of evidence-based practices (e.g.,
NPTs). Using this approach, one can identify key barriers and facilitators to implementation of evidence-based
practices and map them to relevant implementation strategies and target users. The purpose of this CDA is to
develop and test a tailored implementation blueprint for increasing NPT use among diverse Veterans.
Significance/Impact: Over 2 million Veterans suffer from chronic pain. Over the next four decades, Veterans
of color are projected to grow exponentially and there is far more racial/ethnic heterogeneity among women
than men in the VA. There is a critical need to identify effective implementation strategies that can be used to
disseminate NPTs in order to meet the needs of future diverse Veterans with chronic pain.
Innovation: This proposal offers three innovations: 1) An integrated conceptual framework mapping key health
equity domains to implementation science solutions; 2) An implementation blueprint developed using a
comprehensive and rigorous pre-implementation planning approach (i.e., implementation mapping) that is
informed by mixed methods research with target users; and 3) a strong focus on health equity and inclusion of
diverse Veteran engagement via operational partnerships during each stage of research.
Specific Aims: 1) Aim 1: Understand and identify factors driving NPT use among diverse Veterans using
mixed methods; Sub-Aim 1.1: Identify sites at which diverse Veterans are not using NPTs despite NPTs being
available; Sub-Aim 1.2: Evaluate multi-level stakeholder perspectives necessary for designing an
implementation blueprint tailored for diverse Veterans; Sub-Aim 1.3: Assess disparities in NPT use in VA
administrative data; 2) Aim 2: Use implementation mapping to identify core and non-core components of NPT
uptake and design an implementation blueprint tailored for diverse Veterans; Sub-Aim 2.1: Generate a matrix
of change outcomes resulting from use of a tailored implementation blueprint; Sub-Aim 2.2: Develop protocols
and materials comprising the tailored implementation blueprint; and 3) Aim 3: Measure pre-implementation
outcomes of the tailored blueprint developed in Aim 2, including feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness,
dose, complexity, and self-efficacy among target users.
Methodology: In Aim 1.1, a quantitative sampling strategy using VA administrative will inform the selection of
four implementation sites. In Aim 1.2, qualitative interviews will identify factors driving NPT use among diverse
Veterans, which will, in turn, inform the selection of patient and organizational factors in Aim 1.3 quantitative
analyses. In Aim 2.1, we will use implementation mapping and synthesize findings from Aim 1 to develop a
needs assessment and design an implementation blueprint. In Aim 2.2, we will develop blueprint protocols and
materials comprising patient- and provider-facing implementation strategies that promote the ideas of “push”
(e.g., academic detailing) and “pull” (e.g., direct-to-patient outreach) In Aim 3, the implementation blueprint will
be assessed among providers and diverse Veterans for pre-implementation outcomes of acceptability,
feasibility, appropriateness, dose, and complexity using evaluation surveys and interviews.
Next Steps/Implementation: These findings will inform the development of two HSR&D investigator-initiated
research (IIR) proposals to be submitted in Years 3 and 5 of the CDA. Notably, this approach can inform the
future implementation of evidence-based care across VA and other health systems."

This Maximizing Investigators’ Research Award (MIRA) proposal is directly relevant to the long-range
plans of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS). Our laboratory received continuous
NIGMS funding since 2004 that allowed us to make substantial advances in our understanding of the
mechanisms of the dynamic contacts between neighboring cells (adherens junctions), as well as between
cells and the extracellular matrix (focal adhesions structures). These cell junctions, in addition of holding
animal cells together, communicate signals and control the stress placed upon cells.
Over the past 16 years, we contributed important mechanistic discoveries towards an understanding of
· how the cell-cell junctions connect cells in tissues to regulate tissue homeostasis that are crucial to
 provide the tissue barrier of epithelia, as well as cell migration and proliferation; and
· how cell junctions initiate and maintain cell adhesion while regulating the organization of the underlying
 actin cytoskeleton by establishing a center for cell signaling and gene transcript regulation.
Such processes are highly dynamic and tightly regulated. Our laboratory focused on defining the activation
mechanisms of key regulators of these cell junctions that we studied biochemically and in live cells. Our
discoveries were accelerated by our development of new techniques that overcame significant structural
biology hurdles that stalled the field and that are applicable to many other structural biology studies.
We discovered how talin activates vinculin, two ubiquitously expressed, actin-binding proteins, to stabilizes
focal adhesions and thereby suppressing cell migration. Our high-resolution vinculin crystal structures, that
we confirmed biochemically and in live cells, showed the auto-inhibitory intramolecular interactions that
inactivate vinculin and thereby prevent vinculin from binding to the actin cytoskeleton.
On the other hand, our high-resolution crystal structures of a-catenin, a crucial mediator of intercellular
adhesions, revealed the mechanistic roles that its quaternary structures play in cell-cell adhesion and in
the formation of the dynamic link to the actin cytoskeleton. Significantly, our discoveries led to mechano-
transduction studies of cell-cell and cell-matrix junctions on how cells sense and transmit forces.
More recently, we discovered how lipid binding to vinculin, to its cardiac isoform metavinculin, and to talin
regulates focal adhesion turnover. This knowledge and expertise are the foundation for further discoveries
that will additionally focus on the understudied role that the plasma membrane plays in cell adhesion.
In the long run, we hope to gain a complete understanding of cell adhesion by attaining a near atomic
structure of a “synthetic” cell junction. The regulation and dysregulation of cell junctions are fundamental to
many biological processes such as development and cancer, and our proposed studies have therefore
both basic and potentially translational significance."

The Northwestern University (NU) and Mali’s University of Sciences, Techniques, and Technologies of
Bamako (USTTB)’s Infection-Associated Cancer (NM-IAC) Research Training Program addresses a National
Cancer Institute (NCI) high research priority and a significant and growing source of morbidity and mortality in
sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in Mali. In 2018, the four most common infection-associated cancers (IACs;
cervical, liver, gastric and lung cancers) represented more than a quarter (27%) of all registered cancers in
Mali. The NM-IAC Program seeks to build an interdisciplinary, collaborative, research training program to train
researchers in the conduct of population-based cancer epidemiology and molecular studies and advance the
discovery of unique population-specific risk factors and biomarkers for the development of risk stratification and
screening tools of individuals with underlying infections at increased risk of associated cancers, with the
ultimate goal of improving detection, treatment, and outcomes. The NM-IAC Program will leverage our team’s
extensive experience in conducting NIH-funded global health research training programs in Africa, program
refinements, and highly successful training resources and outcomes from our decade-long, research-training
collaboration between USTTB and NU. Our central hypothesis is that building capacity in the key disciplines
involved in IACs will empower Malian and US investigators to develop and implement novel, contextually
appropriate, and culturally adapted risk stratification and screening tools. To achieve our goals, our specific
aims are to (1) Train two (2) PhD-level cancer epidemiologists, each with a focus on one of the four IACs
and capable of (i) designing and conducting population-based cancer epidemiology studies; (ii) developing
protocols for biospecimen collection, processing, and storage; and (iii) evaluating population-specific
biomarkers for use in screening and identifying “at-risk” populations; and Two master’s-level molecular
pathologists, one biostatistician, and one bio-informatician, capable of (i) collecting and managing clinical,
laboratory, and population-level specimens and data; (ii) using virtual modalities for training, education, and
mentoring and telepathology for distance microscopic diagnostics and training; and (iii) performing
comprehensive biostatistical and bioinformatics analyses, generated from population-level studies; (2)
Enhance the knowledge and skills of existing faculty, particularly early career faculty, to contribute to and
participate in interdisciplinary research teams of mechanistic and population-based studies of IACs through
medium-term intensive workshops and mentored research projects led by the scientists trained in Aim 1; and
(3) Optimize engagement of public health scientists, clinicians, and health system stakeholders through
workshops and seminars to disseminate knowledge about the novel epidemiological and biomarker tools and
strategies, for use in new programs focused on the prevention and detection of IACs in Mali."
10873301,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Three million global tuberculosis (TB) cases remain undiagnosed each year, which is a key factor underpinning
why TB is the leading cause of death among people living with HIV (PWH) and the leading infectious cause of
death worldwide. While community-wide screening for TB in high-burden settings is recommended by WHO and
may reduce community prevalence, it is unlikely to be a scalable TB control strategy. Leveraging trained peers
(recent TB patients) to undertake community-based, systematic TB screening among non-household contacts
of newly diagnosed TB patients, including casual contacts at community venues, may be an efficient and
sustainable strategy to facilitate early TB diagnosis and linkage to care; however, little is known about whether
such a strategy is feasible and acceptable to undertake in low-resource, high TB burden settings.
Through targeted training and strong mentorship in implementation science methods, I will develop and evaluate
a theory-informed, multicomponent, peer-led strategy to undertake community-based, systematic TB screening
among non-household contacts of newly diagnosed TB patients attending two public health facilities in Lusaka,
Zambia. This proposal builds upon the research collaboration I began developing during my infectious disease
fellowship and leverages the robust experience and infrastructure of the Centre for Infectious Diseases Research
in Zambia (CIDRZ). In Aim 1, I will undertake mixed-methods research among key stakeholders to identify
barriers to undertaking TB screening among non-household contacts using peers. In Aim 2, I will use a discrete
choice experiment among TB patients, at-risk community members, and community venue owners, to determine
their preferences for the mode of delivery for the implementation strategy components. Findings from Aims 1
and 2 will inform the design of a multicomponent, peer-led TB contact tracing strategy among non-household
contacts that will be evaluated in Aim 3, during a 6-month pilot to assess its feasibility, acceptability and reach.
My overall training objective is to develop implementation science expertise; I will accomplish this by undertaking
carefully selected coursework, workshops, and seminars, and through the guidance of highly accomplished
mentors who are experts in international Implementation science research, mixed-methods research and
multicomponent TB/HIV implementation strategies. My training objectives sequentially map onto my research
aims and are to: (1) gain experience in the application of mixed-methods for implementation science research;
(2) develop expertise in using implementation science methods to develop multicomponent implementation
strategies; (3) develop a strong foundation in study designs and analysis approaches for interventional
implementation research. My career goal is to be an independent physician-scientist who applies implementation
science methods to improve TB and HIV outcomes in low-resource settings. The findings generated from this
K23 award will inform an R01 proposal to undertake an adaptive, cluster randomized trial evaluating a peer-led,
multicomponent TB case finding strategy in Zambia."
10846638,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Vascular calcification affects ~60% of adults over 60 years of age and is frequently seen in patients with
atherosclerosis. Atherosclerotic calcification is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality. Despite decades of research, no medical therapy has been convincingly established to prevent or
reverse vascular calcification. The intimal (luminal) endothelium forms the innermost layer of the vasculature.
Under disease conditions, the intimal endothelial cells (ECs) are stimulated to transform into osteoprogenitor
cells through endothelial-mesenchymal transitions and contribute to vascular calcification. ECs in the adventitia
contribute to neoangiogenesis in vascular disease. However, little is known about whether adventitial ECs are
associated with vascular calcification. During bone development, a subset of ECs defined by high expression of
the EC marker CD31 and the glycoprotein Endomucin (Emcn) are critical for bone formation. Our preliminary
study using Matrix Gla Protein (Mgp) knockout (Mgp-/-) mice as a model of vascular calcification revealed two
distinct populations of ECs in the calcified aortas, the intimal ECs (i-ECs) defined by CD31+Emcn- and the
adventitial ECs (a-ECs) characterized by CD31+Emcn+. These two EC subtypes with distinct Emcn expression
levels were also detected in human calcified arteries. Bulk RNA sequencing studies showed i-ECs were enriched
in stem cell and osteogenic markers and a-ECs exhibited upregulated Notch expression. Endothelial deletion of
the Notch1 gene reduced vascular calcification and increased the survival of the Mgp-/- mice. In this proposal,
we hypothesize that a-ECs support the biomineralization in the vascular calcification in animal models and
human atherosclerotic lesions, and are closely regulated by Notch signaling. In Aim 1, we will define the
molecular signature of the a-EC (CD31+Emcn+) population in vascular calcification using single cell RNA
sequencing. We will delineate the developmental trajectories of a-ECs in vascular calcification with correlation
to the extent and severity of calcification. In Aim 2, we will determine the contribution of endothelial subtypes (a-
ECs and i-ECs) and Notch signaling in atherosclerotic calcification. We will investigate the effect of endothelial-
specific deletion of the Notch1 receptor on EC subtypes, calcification and transcriptional profiles in
atherosclerotic lesions. The proposed studies will provide novel insight into the fundamental mechanisms of
endothelial cell biology in atherosclerotic calcification and may identify potential gene targets for selective
therapeutic modulation. Together with the mentored career development plan, the completion of the projects will
serve as a foundation to facilitate the candidate to transition into a successful and independent physician scientist
in cardiovascular research."
10868610,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
Adolescence is an “age of risk” for the emergence of first onset of bipolar spectrum disorders (BSD). Despite
their prevalence and public health significance, major unanswered questions exist regarding the mechanisms
involved in vulnerability to BSDs. BSDs are associated with hypersensitivity to reward and elevated reward-
related brain function. However, research has not yet tested whether chronically high reward responsivity (RR)
or increases in RR development during adolescence, beyond baseline RR, predicts first onset of BSD. A
separate literature documents circadian rhythm disruption in BSDs, and social rhythm disruption (SRD) can
trigger BSD episodes. Yet, research has not tested whether baseline circadian dysregulation, chronic social
and circadian rhythm disruptions, or increases in these rhythm disruptions during adolescence predict onset of
BSD. Further, circadian and reward approaches to BSDs mostly have proceeded in parallel. However, we and
others have proposed integrated reward-circadian models of BSDs based on evidence the two systems
influence each other and interact to affect mood functioning. When dysregulated, reward and circadian system
signaling may combine to form a positive feedback loop, whereby dysregulation in one system exacerbates
dysregulation in the other. This proposal is the first systematic test of a novel, integrated reward-circadian
model for first onset of BSD. We will use an innovative biobehavioral high-risk design to examine bidirectional
relationships between multiple indices and domains (monetary, social) of RR and multiple indices of social and
circadian rhythms and their joint prediction of first onset of BSD and increases in bipolar symptoms. Three
hundred twenty 14-16 year old participants (Ps) will complete a prospective 3-year longitudinal study. Ps with
no prior BSD will be selected along the entire dimension of self-reported RR, with oversampling at the high tail
of the dimension in order to increase the likelihood of BSD onsets. At Times 1-6, every 6 months, Ps will
complete assessments of reward-relevant and SRD life events and self-report and diagnostic assessments of
bipolar symptoms and episodes. Yearly, at Times 1, 3, and 5, Ps also will complete self-report measures of
circadian chronotype (morningness-eveningness) and social rhythm regularity, a salivary dim light melatonin
onset (DLMO) procedure to assess circadian phase, self-report, behavioral, and neural (fMRI) assessments of
monetary and social RR, and a 7-day EMA period. During each EMA period, Ps will complete continuous
measures of sleep/wake and activity (actigraphy) and 3 within-day (morning, afternoon, evening) measures of
life events coded for reward-relevance and SRD, monetary and social reward responsivity, positive and
negative affect, and hypo/manic and depressive symptoms. The fMRI scan and DLMO procedure will occur on
the day before the start of each EMA period, excluding weekends. This proposal is an innovative integration of
research on reward and circadian signaling in understanding first onset of BSD in adolescence. It has the
potential to facilitate reward and social/circadian rhythm interventions to treat, and ideally prevent, BSD."
10805477,"Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death, but progress in suicide prevention has been slowed by
critical gaps in knowledge about predictors of imminent risk. Impulsivity is an ideal candidate for a proximal risk
factor: it is a known transdiagnostic distal risk factor, it fluctuates over time within individuals, and it is a
modifiable target for intervention. Existing suicide research, however, has not examined multiple components
of real-time, state impulsivity over high-risk periods — a necessary step to test (a) whether impulsivity reduces
ability to resist suicidal urges in real time, (b) which components of this multi-faceted construct are associated
with suicide risk and when, and (c) whether patterns differ for individuals or subgroups. Research: We propose
a fine-grained, intensive longitudinal investigation of associations between components of impulsivity and
suicidal urges in two samples at high risk for suicide. Aim 1 will involve secondary data analysis of a digital
monitoring study of individuals presenting to an emergency department with suicidal thoughts to analyze real-
time associations between impulsivity, suicidal urges, and ability to resist suicidal urges. We will test whether
state impulsivity is predictive beyond the effect of trait impulsivity. In Aim 2, we will conduct a digital monitoring
study of 140 individuals hospitalized for suicidal thoughts to assess multiple components of state impulsivity
using self-report, mobile tasks, and passive phone data, and we will test specific associations with suicidal
urges and ability to resist them in real time. In Aim 3, we will compare group-level, subgroup-level, and
personalized models of these data using a combination of inferential statistics (network modeling) and
predictive analytics (machine learning). This work will allow us to dramatically improve understanding of a key
transdiagnostic process, laying the groundwork for development of detection and intervention strategies
targeted at specific elements of impulsivity at an optimal timescale. Candidate’s Career Development, Goals,
and Environment: This proposal’s research aims and the candidate’s career development will be supported
by the many resources available at Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School as well as formal
training and mentorship in (T1) digital monitoring of patients at high risk for suicide, (T2) advanced multivariate
longitudinal data analysis, (T3) digital phenotyping, and (T4) preparing for an intervention-focused R01
submission. The mentorship team includes Mentor Dr. Jordan Smoller, leading expert in precision psychiatry
and predictive analytics; Co-Mentors Dr. Matthew Nock, leader in the study of suicide; and Dr. Evan Kleiman,
expert in real-time monitoring and digital phenotyping of suicidal states; and Consultants Dr. Aidan Wright,
expert in multilevel and personalized statistical modeling; Dr. JP Onnela, leader in digital phenotyping and
statistical network science; and Dr. Laura Germine, pioneer in mobile task assessment. This award will provide
the candidate with advanced training and skills necessary to launch an independent research program focused
on using mobile technology to advance understanding of impulsive decision-making and suicide."
10899527,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cleft lip and/or cleft palate has an incidence of approximately 1 in 700 births making it one of the most common
congenital birth defects. Gaining a more complete understanding of the genetics and signaling mechanisms
involved will provide a foundation for improving treatment of patients with orofacial clefts, ultimately reducing
an enormous burden on the healthcare system. Several signaling pathways intersect to regulate the proper
development of the palate which makes developing targeted therapies to treat or prevent cleft palate
challenging. Dissecting the components of each pathway involved will provide a more complete picture of
palatogenesis. The Wnt signaling pathway is an important regulator of palatal development and regulates early
patterning by cranial neural crest cells through regulation of induction, migration, and differentiation of these
cells. Wnt signaling also intersects many morphogenic pathways that regulate palatal shelf elongation,
elevation, and fusion. Frizzleds (FZDs) are transmembrane receptors for Wnt ligands and mutations in some of
the 10 FZD genes have been identified in patients with both syndromic and non-syndromic cleft lip and/or
palate. Specifically, heterozygous nonsense mutations in FZD2 have been identified in patient families with
Robinow Syndrome (RS) or Autosomal Dominant Omodysplasia (ADO), syndromes which are characterized
by limb reductions and craniofacial anomalies including cleft palate. While these mutations in FZD2 were
thought to cause haploinsufficiency, heterozygous deletion of Fzd2 in mice does not lead to cleft palate. We
will use mouse models harboring RS/ADO-associated mutations to better understand how FZD2 functions in
the developing palate. Given the association of mutations in other Wnt pathway genes (WNT5A, ROR2, DVL)
in RS and ADO, we hypothesize that these components signal together with FZD2 to regulate palatogenesis.
We hypothesize that FZD2 regulates cell migration and palatal patterning through a non-canonical WNT5A-
ROR2 pathway and further hypothesize that human RS- and ADO-associated Fzd2 mutations act dominantly
to interfere with Fzd signaling. To achieve these research goals, we propose the following aims: 1) determine
the phenotypic consequences of Fzd2 deletion and RS/ADO-Fzd2 mutations on palatal development in mice,
and 2) determine the molecular mechanisms behind Fzd2 regulation of palate development. Data generated in
this proposal will ultimately support the development of novel therapeutic approaches and interventions in Wnt
signaling-related diseases. These research plan and career development activities proposed here will form a
solid basis for my future independent research program."

As a result of prolonged intubation, tracheostomy, external trauma, penetrating fragment projectiles, gunshot
wounds and improvised explosive devices during combat, and benign or malignant tumors, many soldiers and
veterans in the US military suffer from severe trachea stenosis or damage that can cause complete airway failure,
Since there is no successful long-term treatment for long-segment tracheal stenosis or damage, tissue
engineering strategies have been explored to develop neotracheas using different combinations of biomaterials
and cell sources. However, biomaterial scaffold-based approaches often interfere with critical cell-cell
interactions, cell proliferation and new extracellular matrix production that are important during the formation of
functional trachea tissue. A functional replacement trachea must retain (1) radial rigidity to prevent restenosis,
(2) anastomose with host vasculature to adequately provide nutrients to the implant, and (3) contain respiratory
epithelium to provide a protective mucosal layer. Combining three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technologies with
scaffold-free tissue engineering principles presents a powerful platform for engineering a multi-tissue functional
trachea, and would circumvent the aforementioned limitations of scaffold-based approaches. This proposal aims
to leverage the benefits of our recently developed individual cell-only 3D bioprinting technology, which allows for
printing of complex and high-resolution cell condensation-based tissue constructs to engineer functional
tracheas. We plan to print scaffold-free, multi-tissue neotracheas using multiple discrete individual cell-only
bioinks for spatially distinct differentiation of tissue types driven by spatially controlled presentation of tissue-
specific growth factors. Construct self-assembly will be driven by the condensation of autologously sourced
human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) for cartilaginous tissue and autologous endothelial progenitor cells
and hMSCs for prevascular tissue, with autologous human bronchial epithelial cells applied to line the lumen of
the neotrachea. Specifically, this proposal aims to (1) examine the role of the physical properties of the microgel
support slurry on cell-only bioink printing, condensation formation/maintenance, and chondrogenesis of the 3D
bioprinted structures, (2) 3D bioprint cartilage ring constructs with chondrogenic bioink and prevascularized ring
constructs with vasculogenic bioink using the individual cell-only bioprinting technology, and (3) engineer
prevascularized and epithelized tracheal tissue with chondrogenic and vasculogenic bioinks using the individual
cell-only bioprinting technology. As an exploratory aim, the capacity of the engineered tracheas to restore airway
functionality will be evaluated in an animal defect model. This work ultimately seeks to utilize a facile and flexible
individual cell-only bioink 3D printing platform to engineer a patient-specific replacement trachea that provides
requisite physiologic and mechanical properties for replacement in those that are affected by long-segment
tracheal stenosis. The inherent flexibility of this individual cell-only 3D printing platform to create complex
structures composed of multiple spatially distinct tissue types can be leveraged to develop other multi-tissue
organs."

10825578,"Cognitive training is considered a promising non-pharmacologic intervention for slowing cognitive aging and AD/ADRD. Ensuring adherence is essential if we are to understand the mechanisms of intervention, as well as to maximize long-term benefits from intervention in slowing or even preventing cognitive decline and progression of AD/ADRD. The objective of the proposed R61 is to examine the mechanisms of action underlying adherence to prescribed regimens of the vision-based speed of processing (VSOP) training, which has been among the first-line cognitive training preventative strategies for cognitive aging. Our central hypothesis is that strengthening the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) function, via an established resonance frequency breathing (RFB) training, will lead to greater adherence to VSOP training, reflected in greater engagement with and more use of the VSOP training program during and in the months following the prescribed intervention period. We will apply an established, multi-dimensional framework of mental fatigability for measuring effective engagement in cognitive training. We propose a 3-group comparison in a stage 0 mechanistic intervention study: RFB in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a preclinical stage of AD/ADRD (MCI, n = 31), RFB in healthy control (HC, n = 31), and an imagery-guided relaxation (IR) control in MCI (n = 31). All participants will engage in an 8-week prescribed home-based VSOP training and two 2-week booster sessions provided at 3- and 9-months after intervention. RFB or IR will be practiced immediately before every VSOP training during the prescribed and booster sessions. The aims are to identify the role of RFB intervention in adherence (Aim 1); examine the relationship between the vmPFC function and adherence (Aim 2); and build a personalized predictive model for long-term adherence (exploratory Aim 3). Compared to neurocognitive effects of cognitive training, how to ensure adherence is an understudied topic in the development of prevention strategies for AD/ADRD, which aligns with research plans described in AD/ADRD Research Milestone 8.B. The proposed study will provide novel mechanistic and clinically relevant information on how to comprehensively measure adherence, the mechanism underlying adherence, and potential intervention strategies for enhancing adherence to interventions serving for slowing or preventing AD/ADRD."

Olfactory Receptors (ORs) comprise the largest gene family in the genome, and ORs serve key
functions in a variety of tissues beyond the nose. We have identified an evolutionarily conserved
OR, Olfr558, which localizes to vascular smooth muscle cells and plays a role in blood pressure
regulation. It is well-established, in both humans and in animal models, that normotensive
premenopausal females have lower blood pressure than normotensive males by approximately
~10mmHg. In contrast, blood pressure is similar in postmenopausal females and males, due to
an increase in female blood pressure with aging. We find that sex differences in blood pressure
are absent in Olfr558 knockout (KO) mice, and, that wild-type (WT) but not KO females increase
blood pressure with aging. In this proposal, we will explore the role of Olfr558 in mediating
changes in blood pressure in aging. In Aim 1, we will compare blood pressure by telemetry
between WT and KO mice which are young (4-7 months, male and female), aged (18-22
months, male and female), or young (4-7 months) females in whom menopause has been
chemically induced via VCD (4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide). In Aim 2, we will use tissues from
these same mice to assay how renin (Aim 2a) and vascular reactivity (Aim 2b) are altered in WT
vs KO in these various groups. These studies will uncover the role of a well-conserved OR in
the cardiovascular physiology of aging, and in so doing will reveal novel insights into sex
differences, blood pressure regulation, aging, and menopause."

malaria vaccine candidates currently most advanced in the clinic, RTS,S and R21, target only the major NANP

vaccine have been the 30-50% efficacy and transient protection. A further potential complication is pre-existing
immunity/tolerance to the HBsAg carrier, which is derived from a human pathogen. To circumvent these
problems we have developed a non-human pathogen-derived carrier platform, specifically the core protein
from the woodchuck hepadnavirus (WHcAg). Modified WHcAg VLPs are used as the vaccine platform for
several reasons: WHc-CS hybrid VLPs elicit extremely high levels of anti-CS protective antibodies; new
protective epitopes can be added simply; and since WHc-CS hybrid VLPs can be made in bacteria, the vaccine
will have a low cost-of-goods. In preliminary studies we developed a WHc-CS hybrid VLP that contains two
neutralizing Pf-CS repeat B cell epitopes and three “universal” malaria-specific T cell domains. This WHc-CS
hybrid VLP (designated VLP-162) is very immunogenic in mice and rabbits and elicits neutralizing anti-CS
repeat antibodies that prevent P. berghei/Pf hybrid sporozoite liver infection in vivo and produces sterile
immunity to blood stage infection in 90-100% of mice. Our approach is to expand the scope and protective
efficacy of VLP-162 by adding B cell epitopes defined by the protective human Mabs CIS43, 313/317, L9 and
5D5, plus expand the CS-specific T cell epitopes delivered by the VLP. The strategy for developing an optimal
next-generation malaria vaccine is divided into 3 aims: Aim 1) build on VLP-162 by incorporation of the newly
defined CS-derived protective B cell epitopes and broadening the number of CS-specific T cell epitopes; Aim
2) optimize immunogenicity by assessing adjuvant formulations in multiple mouse strains; and Aim 3) conduct
in vivo protective efficacy tests in Pf mouse challenge models using PbPf hybrid sporozoites that contain the
entire Pf CS or engineered Pf CS proteins that allow us to measure the contribution of each epitope to
protective efficacy. Combination of these two technologies, the WHcAg platform and the PbPf hybrid
sporozoite challenge models, will allow in vivo protective efficacy to be determined in infectious model
systems."

This NIAID R01 proposal describes the framework in which Wan-Lin Lo, Ph.D., will address the signaling
properties and physiological function of CD7 in T cells in her independent laboratory at the University of Utah
School of Medicine. While previous studies have treated CD7 as an inessential costimulatory molecule, the
preliminary results in this proposal suggest that CD7 supports T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and effector
functions: CD7 may function as a major PI3K-recruiting scaffold protein for the TCR in a ligand-independent way
and as a costimulatory receptor that lowers the TCR activation threshold. Dr. Lo envisions that CD7 is a novel
immunoregulatory target for the modulation of T cell function in infections, cancers, and autoimmune diseases.
The overall goals of this proposal are to characterize the mechanisms used by CD7 to facilitate T cell
differentiation during infection and to explore the possibility of targeting CD7 to enhance or mitigate T cell effector
function. The first goal will examine the influences of CD7-involved signaling in T cells during acute and chronic
viral infection at the proteomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic levels, with the hypothesis that CD7 amplifies
proximal TCR signaling, stabilizes TCR:peptide–major histocompatibility complex interactions, and enhances T
cell responses to weak ligands. The second goal will define altered T cell fates in the absence of CD7 during
acute and chronic viral infection to test the hypothesis that CD7-involved signaling is essential to promote antiviral
T cell effector function, and that an optimal level of CD7 signaling is required to prevent T cell exhaustion due to
CD7 hyperreactivity or to avoid T cell unresponsiveness due to the absence of CD7. The objective of this study
is to address the current roadblocks to immunomodulatory therapies (i.e., T cell exhaustion and autoimmune
toxicities). The focuses of this proposal are highly relevant to the mission of NIAID, and will enhance our
understanding of the signaling mechanisms underlying T cell fate decisions during infection, especially the
inherent, characteristic proteomic adaptations and epigenetic reprogramming that reinforce T cell identities.
Ultimately, this work will aid the design and development of therapeutics to target CD7, and potentiate future
studies to assess how CD7-modulated T cell functional adaptation may be regulated in various disease settings."
10909016,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Ankyrin-1-mediated membrane protein clustering and crosslinking to the
spectrin-actin cytoskeleton is critical to maintaining the shape and mechanical properties of the erythrocyte
membrane, and disruption of the ankyrin-1 complex is a proximal cause of several hereditary anemias
characterized by alterations in erythrocyte shape and stability, the most frequent of which is hereditary
spherocytosis (HS). The mechanistic basis of ankyrin-mediated membrane protein clustering is not well
understood, in erythrocytes or any other tissue. Understanding how ankyrin-1 clusters functionally important
membrane proteins such as the band 3 anion exchanger and crosslinks them to the spectrin-actin skeleton, will
inform our understanding of how ankyrins modulate membrane curvature in a physiological complex, and how
loss of specific components leads to disruption of membrane curvature in the context of inherited anemias such
as HS. We will approach this challenge of characterizing the architecture, dynamics and regulation of the human
erythrocyte ankyrin-1 complex in the context of three specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will probe the architecture and
assembly of erythrocyte ankyrin-1 complexes, with the ultimate goal of understanding their disposition in the
context of native erythrocyte membranes. We will approach this using single particle cryoelectron microscopy
(cryoEM) of purified complexes, in either detergent micelles or lipid nanodiscs, as well as applying cryoelectron
tomography (cryoET) and sub-tomogram averaging to characterize the structure, composition and conformation
of the complex in the context of native erythrocyte membrane vesicles. In Aim 2, we shift our focus to the band
3 anion exchanger, the most abundant membrane protein in the erythrocyte and a key binding partner of ankyrin-
1, which plays a key role in gas exchange across the membrane, but for which the transport mechanism is
unclear. We will characterize the inward-facing state of the transporter, both alone and in complex with ankyrin-
1, and identify functionally relevant anion binding sites using cryoEM in conjunction with molecular dynamics
simulations. Functional characterization of recombinantly expressed mutants using liposome uptake assays will
be used to validate identified anion binding sites. In Aim 3, we will investigate regulation of the band 3 anion
exchanger, and the ankyrin-1 complex, by the phosphoinositide PIP2. A PIP2 binding site has recently been
structurally identified in band 3, but the functional significance of this site is unclear. We will address this by
depleting PIP2 from both purified band 3, and the purified ankyrin-1 complex, and characterizing the effects of
PIP2 depletion on structure and function. Our research will broadly impact the field, by unraveling the structural
basis of ankyrin-mediated membrane protein clustering and modulation of membrane curvature, and provide
insights into the regulation of both processes by phosphoinositides."

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the leading cause of over 36,000 new cancer cases of cervical, ano-
genital, and oropharyngeal cancers in the United States each year. While multi-valent vaccinations to prevent
HPV infections have been available since 2006, uptake of the vaccine is well below national Healthy
People 2030 targets (80% of adolescents at ages 13-15 years up-to-date with HPV vaccination). Adolescent
vaccination rates are especially low in rural areas (about 11% lower than in urban areas). Compared to urban
residents, rural residents have a higher incidence of HPV-related cancers and face unique barriers to HPV
vaccination, including limited access to providers, fewer vaccine reminders, longer travel time to clinics, and
less favorable societal norms about HPV vaccination. Moreover, rural adolescents are less likely than their
urban counterparts to receive a provider recommendation for the HPV vaccine. Rural healthcare teams are
often limited by a lack of systematic methods to identify and track eligible patients and/or their parents for
outreach. While much is known about clinic-based approaches to improve HPV vaccination among urban
residents, less is known about their effectiveness among rural residents, including rural Hispanic populations,
the fastest growing sub-population in rural settings. The proposed study is designed to address these
barriers by adapting and testing approaches to effectively communicate the importance of vaccination
to improve HPV vaccination rates for rural populations, and the sub-populations within (e.g. Hispanic
persons). Our study includes a randomized controlled trial of adapted reminders to address the needs of
diverse rural populations. We will create clinic systems to prompt vaccination for eligible children/adolescents
and deliver messages to parents/caregivers, whose mode and content is specifically tailored for rural and rural
Hispanic populations. Our study, Practice-based Approaches to Promote HPV Vaccination in the Safety Net
(PREVENT), incorporates formative patient- and clinic-informed research to design and evaluate an automated
data-driven reminder intervention using low-cost approaches (automated phone calls and text messages). We
will compare usual care to Automated Patient Reminders, and to a higher-intensity intervention arm using
automated messages plus linguistically and culturally tailored interventions to deliver live reminders,
Automated Plus Live Patient Reminders. PREVENT’s design and evaluation will involve tailoring message
mode and content for parents and caregivers of rural and ethnically diverse rural patients. This study will serve
as one of the first to develop and test the effectiveness of strategies to promote HPV vaccination among
diverse rural patients in the Mountain West. Our strong research team demonstrates successful partnerships
with primary care practices in rural populations. Once implemented into practice, our intervention could reduce
rural/urban disparities in HPV-associated cancers in the US."
10848250,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Bridging the Science-to-Service Gap in Aging Care (BRIDGE THE GAP): Prevention,
Optimization and Living Well with Persistent or Serious Illnesses
The proposed T32 postdoctoral fellowship will address the pressing need for strengthening and diversifying the pipeline for
well-trained clinician investigators positioned to advance the field of aging research through the development, testing, and
implementation of clinical and behavioral preventive interventions (CBPIs) across the spectrum from health to illness across
all care settings (e.g., hospital, nursing homes) and in the community for individuals and their informal caregivers. Despite
advances in medical, social and behavioral sciences, a widely acknowledged science-to-service gap remains such that most
interventions are rarely implemented in the routine care of older adults in clinical or community settings. This gap is
particularly apparent in the care of those with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), where there is a dearth
of evidence-based approaches to support persons living with dementia (PLWD) and their caregivers across the disease
trajectory. A key reason for this “implementation cliff” is the lack of rigorous and comprehensive training in all stages of
the NIH model for new clinical investigators that enter the field of aging. Further, to date, very little research has been
focused on prevention of age-related negative consequences. We are well positioned to address this important gap because
we have access to both an exceptionally talented pool of interdisciplinary trainees (PhD and MD) and an unparalleled
network of interdisciplinary, NIH funded faculty mentors and investigators with complementary expertise in CBPIs in
primary prevention (e.g. treating ADRD risk factors to prevent onset), secondary prevention (e.g., prevention of emotional
distress in ADRD), and tertiary prevention (e.g., increasing quality of life in ADRD). Two new trainees who have recently
completed their clinical training will enter the program each year and will receive a maximum of three years of support
(maximum 6 trainees at one time). Trainees will receive interdisciplinary mentorship across 1) the Department of Internal
Medicine Mongan Institute (including the Center for Aging and Serious Illness) 2) the Department of Psychiatry (including
the Center for Health Outcomes and Interdisciplinary Research) and 3) the Department of Neurology (including the
Massachusetts ADRD Research Center). Trainees will receive specialized didactic training that covers methods across the
NIH stage model, trial design and community engaged research across primary, secondary and tertiary prevention,
biostatistics, clinical trial management, scientific writing, health disparities and social determinants of health, leadership
skills and career planning, in preparation for career development awards or other independent applications to be submitted
by the end of the fellowship period. Trainees will develop mentored clinical research projects that use the NIH stage model
and will receive experiential training through their mentors’ NIH funded clinical trials. Our trainees will graduate with a
deep understanding of the NIH stage model, skills to develop and implement scalable and equitable preventive interventions
in all care settings, and the research tools necessary to advance the science of aging and improve care for our growing older
adult population."
10864977,"Abstract: The objective of the proposed research is to understand the diverse lamina-specific neurons, and
connections between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the rostral aspect of the dorsal premotor
cortex (PMdr) during decision-making. Decision-making refers to our ability to choose and perform appropriate
actions based on sensory cues and context to achieve behavioral goals. Pressing the brakes to stop the car in
response to a red light or choosing what dress to wear are common decisions that we make in our everyday life.
Disrupted activity in brain areas such as the DLPFC and PMdr contribute to the impairments in decision-making
observed in mental illness. Our past work and other research has provided some insight into the involvement of
DLPFC and PMdr in decision-making and that these areas are strongly interconnected. However, we currently
do not understand 1) the relationship between biophysical properties and morphological structure, and in vivo
decision-related activity of neurons in different layers of these brain areas, and 2) whether the connections
between DLPFC and PMdr are feedforward, feedback or lateral (both feedforward and feedback). We address
these open questions by using a multimodal approach that combines in vivo neurophysiology in DLPFC and
PMdr of behaving monkeys, decoding and granger causality analysis, optical stimulation of DLPFC inputs to
PMdr, tract tracing experiments and in vitro single neuron electrophysiology and morphometry in slices from the
same subjects. Our first aim uses laminar multi-contact electrodes to investigate neuronal responses across
layers of PMdr, and DLPFC while monkeys perform a novel decision-making task that separates perceptual
decisions from action selection. We will investigate if in vivo differences are related to differences in biophysical
and morphological properties of these neurons with in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of lamina-specific
neurons in PMdr slices. In Aim 2, we examine the granger causality between the local field potentials recorded
simultaneously in DLPFC and PMdr to understand whether DLPFC sends a feedforward driving input or a
modulating feedback input. We combine these in vivo experiments with anatomical tracing experiments in
DLPFC to understand the bidirectional laminar pattern of DLPFC and PMdr connections. In Aim 3, we will inject
an opsin in DLPFC and stimulate the anterograde fibers in PMdr in vivo to causally investigate whether the
pattern of activity induced in PMdr by stimulation of DLPFC is consistent with feedforward, feedback, or lateral
connections. To obtain a more detailed understanding of the pattern of inputs from DLPFC to PMdr, we will
investigate in vitro synaptic responses of these PMdr neurons in layers 3 and 5 to optical stimulation of afferent
DLPFC fibers and localize the morphological compartments of PMdr neurons to which DLPFC afferent fibers
provide inputs. Impact: This project will elucidate the in vivo and in vitro laminar dynamics within and interactions
between two critical, clinically relevant brain areas. Such data is a prerequisite for future development of circuit-
level therapeutics for mental illness and brain machine interfaces for recovery following brain injury."

This proposal presents a five year research career development program focused on the study of the role of the
IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) on CD4+ T cells in cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE). The candidate is currently an
Instructor in Dermatology at Harvard Medical School in the Department of Dermatology at the Brigham and
Women's Hospital. The outlined proposal builds upon the candidate's previous research and clinical experience
in molecular and cellular immunology and cutaneous biology by leveraging the use of emerging genomic
technologies within Dr. Vijay Kuchroo's, his primary mentor's, laboratory. The proposed experiments and didactic
work will position the candidate with a unique set of cross disciplinary skills that will enable him to transition to
independence as a physician scientist in autoimmune cutaneous biology.
Cutaneous involvement is a major feature of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a systemic autoimmune
disease affecting multiple organs, but can also occur in the absence of systemic disease. Cutaneous lupus
erythematosus (CLE) significantly impacts patients' quality of life, socioeconomic status, and can result in
permanent scarring and dyspigmentation. Therefore, more effective therapies are critically required. However,
our current understanding of CLE pathogenesis is limited, making the development of targeted therapies
difficult. As a consequence, patient care can be negatively impacted as optimal treatment regimens cannot
always be achieved. Therapies can improve the skin, systemic disease, both, or neither. Therefore, it is of critical
importance that a better understanding of the basic immunologic underpinnings of CLE pathogenesis be
achieved to meet this clinical need. This proposal aims to investigate the role of IL-23R expression on CD4+ T
cells in the development of CLE. The proposed project will directly address this vital question while overcoming
current limitations in the field. Aim 1 will examine the mechanisms by which the IL-23R confers pathogenicity to
CD4+ T cells. Aim 2 tests whether the IL-23R confers pathogenicity to CD4+ T cells, which can then drive
spontaneous skin inflammation in a mouse model of lupus erythematosus. Aim 3 leverages cutting edge genomic
technologies and analysis to identify novel, transcriptionally distinct, pathogenic CD4+ T lymphocytes in the CLE
lesional skin. Taken together, this project combines traditional molecular and cellular approaches with emerging
genomic technologies and analysis to address a critically unmet need in cutaneous autoimmune disease."

Microglia proliferation occurs in numerous neurological disorders, including peripheral and optic nerve injuries,
neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, seizure, infection,
irradiation, and mental disorders. Parabiotic studies, along with studies with single-cell imaging and multicolor
fluorescence fate mapping system, have demonstrated that the self-renewal of resident microglia is responsible
for the expansion of microglia population in mouse models of neurological diseases. In fact, the newborn
microglia generated from microglial self-renewal have significant neurological function with unique transcriptional
profile. Moreover, dysregulation of microglia proliferation significantly impacts the development of many
neurological diseases, indicating that microglia proliferation plays critical roles in the development of neurological
diseases. However, the mechanism of microglia proliferation is largely unknown. We did a group of preliminary
experiments to explore the mechanisms of microglia proliferation, and identified a group of embryonic genes that
have similar expression pattern as proliferation marker Mki67 during microglia development. With single-cell
RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), we found that these embryonic microglial proliferation-associated genes were
upregulated in lumbar cord microglia around the time they proliferate. Our qRT-PCR from the sorted microglia
and microglial RiboTag confirmed the transient upregulation of transcription factor Myc, one of the embryonic
microglial proliferation-associated genes, in lumbar cord microglia shortly after sciatic nerve injury. We also found
that the deletion of Myc from adult microglia significantly prevented the early phase of nerve injury-induced
microglia proliferation, with the late phase of microglia proliferation intact, suggesting that adult microglia
proliferation has a Myc-dependent initiation phase and a Myc-independent maintenance phase. To explore the
signaling pathway upstream of microglial Myc upregulation, we analyzed our scRNA-Seq and found that the
genes encoding DAP12 and its associated membrane protein TREM2, which is required for microglia
proliferation in Alzheimer's disease, are upregulated in lumbar cord microglia after sciatic nerve injury. In addition,
we found that Syk, a protein tyrosine kinase downstream of TREM2 and DAP12, and upstream of Myc, is
phosphorylated in lumbar cord microglia shortly after sciatic nerve injury. In searching for Myc independent
mechanism for the maintenance phase of microglia proliferation, we also found that Mafb, a transcription factor
expressed at much higher level in adult than in embryonic microglia, inhibits microglia proliferation in adult but
not in neonate, and is downregulated in lumbar cord microglia after nerve injury-induced Myc upregulation. We
now propose a set of experiments to further delineate the mechanism of microglia proliferation. Aim 1: To test
the hypothesis that Myc is required for microglia proliferation in general. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that Mafb
contributes to microglia proliferation. Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that CSF1R-TREM2-DAP12-Syk pathway
contributes to the expression regulation of microglial Myc and/or Mafb and to microglia proliferation."

Aggression is essential to the survival of organisms as it allows individuals to obtain and defend resources and
protect mates or offspring. Yet, aggression can become maladaptive when escalated and unrestrained,
sometimes leading to violence in humans. Further, escalated aggression can occur in neuropsychiatric disorders
such as intermittent explosive disorder, schizophrenia, and autism. Therefore, advances in understanding the
cellular, molecular, and circuit pathways underlying aggression will be significant to human health. Both the
serotonergic and dopaminergic neuromodulatory systems are implicated in aggression, yet the specific cell types
and circuitry involved are unknown. The proposed research uses cutting-edge genetic and viral tools to
understand the role of a specialized dopamine-responsive serotonergic (5-HT) neuron subtype critical to the
modulation of aggression, using a mouse model system. This 5-HT neuron subtype is distinguished by the
expression of type-II dopamine receptor (Drd2) and the pan serotonergic transcription factor Pet1, and are
referred to as Drd2-Pet1 neurons. Largely unknown, is the circuitry involving Drd2-Pet1 neurons and the
requirement for the Drd2 receptor in their modulation of behavior. Towards identifying brain regions with inputs
onto Drd2-Pet1 neurons, novel viral vectors for intersectional (Cre- and Flp-dependent) trans-synaptic tracing
were developed (Aim 1). Additionally, to probe the functional importance of Drd2 in this subset of 5-HT neurons,
mice with 5-HT neuron specific deletion of Drd2 were generated and their behavioral phenotype was analyzed
in a behavioral screening panel. This work has found that 5-HT neuron expression of Drd2 is critical for the
modulation of male aggression and acoustic startle reactivity in females, suggesting a potential sexually
dimorphic role (Aim 1). Proposed experiments will further examine the potential sexually dimorphic role of Drd2
expression in 5-HT neurons through the analysis of Drd2-Pet1 neuron modulation of female aggression (Aim
2.1) and characterization of the underlying circuit structure using mouse molecular genetic tools and viral
neuronal circuit tracing techniques (Aim 2.2). This PhD dissertation project will inform upon the molecular,
cellular, and circuit pathways underlying aggression and startle reactivity while testing novel viral-genetic tools
that will be broadly applicable to the study of neuronal subtype connectivity."

Millions of US teens remain at risk of developing human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers due to
inadequate HPV vaccine uptake, despite strong endorsement in clinical guidelines and substantial prior
intervention efforts. A 2018 national survey showed that HPV vaccine complete series coverage for teens age
13-15 years was only 50%, far below the 80% target of Healthy People 2020. Prior research has identified
strong provider recommendation as the most powerful facilitator of HPV vaccine uptake. Yet, little is known
about how to leverage this and other facilitators. Additionally, studies have also revealed multilevel,
multifactorial barriers to improving HPV vaccination including negative parental perceptions and limitations of
health system support. Furthermore, evidence suggests that HPV vaccine barriers can vary across
demographic subgroups, communities and clinics. Despite this knowledge, many prior intervention studies
focus on single-level, single component interventions, leaving many barriers unaddressed. Of studies that are
multilevel and/or multi-component, interventions are often pre-selected to address “typical” barriers but are not
responsive to unique local barriers and local context. To address this critical gap, we propose a 3-arm cluster
randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare implementation strategies that are multilevel and multicomponent
and guided by in-depth understanding of how multilevel factors in the practice settings modify the impact of key
facilitators such as provider recommendation. We will use mixed methods (surveys, interviews, electronic
health records) throughout; initially we will evaluate baseline associations between patient-, provider-, and
clinic-level factors and variations in HPV vaccination rates and the quality of the provider recommendation (Aim
1). In Aim 2, we will compare the effectiveness of: 1) A novel “local-tailored” implementation strategy, co-
designed with local care teams to address local barriers and contexts; versus 2) A “prescribed” strategy, typical
of most health systems, that involves pre-specified interventions addressing pre-selected vaccination barriers;
versus 3) Usual care. We will evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies on improving HPV vaccination
(primary outcome) and strengthening provider recommendation (secondary outcome) as well as analyzing cost
effectiveness. We will also study mechanisms of effect of the implementation strategies (Aim 3). Although the
need of local tailoring seems intuitive, it is unknown if local tailoring will yield superior outcomes that could
offset the extra investment required, supporting the need for this RCT. We will conduct the study within Kaiser
Permanente Southern California, one of the largest community-based pediatric care organizations in the US.
Our study will be guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and the Multilevel
Factors Across the Cancer Care Continuum framework. Completion of these Aims will generate important
insights into the multilevel factors associated with provider recommendation and HPV vaccine uptake. This
study has high potential to generate guidance for diverse health care settings to improve HPV vaccination."

Bacteria in biofilms are more responsible than planktonic cells, for food contamination, infection during
cleaning, and are responsible for 80% of all hospital acquired infections, about 1.6 million infections and
80,000 deaths, at an annual cost of $16.8 to $27.2 billion dollars in the US. Treating biofilms on surfaces
requires constant cleaning as, for example, biofilms that are able to rejuvenate within 30 minutes after raw milk
is introduced to a milk evaporator. Biofilm infections on implanted medical devices make up half of the hospital
acquired infections and the primary treat is to remove the device, increasing surgery and increasing risk of
secondary infection. Biofilm development and reaction to antibiotics are dependent on the geometry, nutrient,
and liquid flow conditions and there are currently few relationships available to translate between one set of
conditions and another. This program seeks to create platforms and mathematical relations that will increase
the ability of researchers, clinicians and manufacturers, to translate from fundamental studies on biofilms with
finite time scales and materials to infections and surfaces. The primary platforms that the proposal seeks to
explore are those that can monitor the impact of external stress, like temperature, fluid shear, antibiotics,
nanoparticles at each stage of biofilm development and simulate real world conditions. Some of those
platforms initially proposed are those that can be made using 3D printers and those that can be easily scaled,
like rotating disk systems. The primary mathematical relations that will be proposed are dimensionless
numbers that can be used to translate from one experimental apparatus to another. Four dimensionless
numbers have been proposed for biofilms and three have been proposed for communication in biofilms, though
their use is spare. Part of this proposal seeks to determine what role, if any, sociomicrobiological interactions,
play in biofilm persistence. For example, Candida albicans increases meropenem tolerance of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. The use of waste byproducts as a means of interaction will likely be prioritized, like how sugar
consumed by Candida may be responsible for the increased tolerance mentioned previously. Finally, this
proposal also seeks to determine how biofilm substitutes can be used to study the impacts of external stress,
like how fluid shear stress and temperature affect antibiotic and nanoparticle and uptake. While neither clinical
nor animal trials are proposed in this study, a participatory dialogue will be conducted between the
researchers, clinicians, manufacturers, and engineers, and sanitation and hygiene professionals to ensure that
results from this research can be used."

In the cell, the RNA made by RNA polymerase (RNAP) folds into its functional three-dimensional shape while it
is being synthesized by RNAP. The kinetics of RNA synthesis, which determine the RNA folding outcome, are
influenced by myriad factors, such as intracellular temperature, pH, concentrations of small molecules and
proteins in the cell, and the exact sequence of DNA being transcribed into RNA. Transcription is not a continuous
process: RNA synthesis by RNAP is interrupted by sequence-dependent pauses, during which RNAP remains
bound to the nucleic acids without active nucleotide addition occurring. These pauses create windows of time
for regulation of transcription to occur. Our research program will address the mechanisms of pausing at the
atomic level and the contribution of pausing to co-transcriptional events, such as folding of RNA, in bacteria and
human mitochondria. The first direction of the program aims to develop tools for capturing and visualizing RNA
folding intermediates during transcription and to understand the effect of pH on the kinetics of RNA synthesis by
RNAP, and thus the RNA folding pathway. The resulting tools will be of broad interest to the RNA community
because they can be applied to follow folding of other biologically important RNAs. A second direction will apply
those tools to map the differences in co-transcriptional RNA folding of “healthy” and mutated human
mitochondrial transfer RNAs (mt-tRNA), thus providing the structural basis for disease-causing mt-tRNA
mutations. We will assess the contribution of mitochondrial RNAP (mtRNAP) pausing to the differential folding
of unmutated vs. disease-variant mt-tRNA. Additionally, we will test another hypothesized function of mtRNAP
pausing: coupling of transcription of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to its replication, which is critical for maintaining
enough mtDNA copies for production of protein components of the oxidative phosphorylation machinery. Finally,
a third research direction will address how the balance between transcription of mtDNA and its packaging is
achieved to cater to the ever-changing cellular needs for energy. The completion of the proposed research will
be transformative to the understanding of basic principles governing gene expression, the molecular
mechanisms of diseases linked to mtDNA, and to the applications of RNA-based tools in synthetic biology."
10873195,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our labs have been extensively studying CD137-CD137L immune signaling in T1D. These studies have
uncovered additional critical mechanistic issues which we propose to study in this application. The regulation of
the CD137-CD137L system is complex, mainly because both CD137 and CD137L signal into the cells
expressing them, which must be taken into account in any analysis of CD137 and CD137L signaling. In our
preliminary data we identify many specific instances in which the effect of CD137 or CD137L signaling differs
according to the type of immune cells. FOXP3+ regulatory CD4 T cells (Tregs), antigen-presenting cells
(APCs), and effector T cells all express different levels of these key molecules with distinct kinetics during the
immune response. The details are critical for understanding how interventions in this system, most specifically
with soluble CD137 (sCD137) which down-regulates immunity via CD137L, affect the course and progression
of T1D. We have recently published that treatment with sCD137, which is expressed in vivo mainly by Tregs
that constitutively express CD137, can ameliorate acute T1D. We demonstrate that sCD137 directly
suppresses mouse CD4 and CD8 T cell activation through binding to CD137L expressed on these cells.
Critically, we have recently proven that CD137L expression on T cells is critical for Treg mediated suppression.
Similar to our findings in mice, we found that human CD25hi CD127low Tregs are the primary source of
sCD137. As in mice, hu-sCD137 inhibited proliferation of human peripheral CD4 T cells. Importantly, we found
that serum sCD137 was lower in human T1D patients compared to age-matched unrelated controls, analogous
to our finding that serum sCD137 is decreased in NOD mice compared to NOD mice congenic for the T1D
protective B10-derived Idd9.3 interval. In addition, we have recently published conclusive proof, using allele-
specific knockout mice, that Tnfrsf9 (encoding CD137) is the diabetogenic gene in the NOD Idd9.3 interval.
Overall, these results indicate that the biology of CD137 and the consequence of its interaction with CD137L
are very similar in mouse and human T1D. Importantly, however, in our investigation of the biology of CD137L
(the target of sCD137), we have recently published that T1D could not be transferred into mice lacking
expression of CD137L on myeloid APCs. Moreover, CD137L expressing myeloid APCs are essential for
accumulation of β-cell specific autoreactive CD8 T cells. These findings highlight the increasingly recognized
role of innate immunity in the initiation and perpetuation of autoimmune T1D, and the need for additional
mechanistic studies of CD137L on myeloid APCs, the critical gatekeeper for T cell entry into the islet. Given
these findings we propose the following aims. Aim 1: Mechanism by which the CD137-positive Treg subset
suppresses immune activation. Aim 2: Mechanistic role of CD137L-expressing myeloid APCs in T1D
pathogenesis and as a target for therapeutic effect of sCD137. Aim 3: Use novel human and mouse soluble
CD137-Fc proteins to test efficacy in humanized mouse models and on human monocytes and T cells."

South Asians account for nearly 25% of the global population, displaying unique and complex genetic and

paucity of modern and ancient genomics data deriving from individuals of South Asian ancestry, result in a
fragmented picture of the origins and evolution of the genetic and socio-cultural diversity of this region. Over
the next five years, one of primary research programs in the Raghavan lab will leverage our expertise in
ancient and modern genomics to address three crucial themes to promote our understanding of the genetics of
South Asians and their diseases: (i) the regional demographic history over the last ~8,000 years, (ii) the
prehistoric occurrence of infectious diseases and the evolution of pathogens and infectious diseases in this
region, and (iii) the impact of dietary transitions on the gut microbiome composition and health of Indian
populations. Since present-day gene pools and disease landscapes are products of long-acting evolutionary
processes, we will jointly generate and analyze ancient and modern human genomic datasets in order to
achieve Themes 1 and 2 that focus on the evolution of modern human populations, including reconstructing
past migrations and admixture events, and infectious diseases, including the detection and phylogenetic
characterization of ancient pathogens in human skeletal materials, respectively. Theme 3 will additionally
benefit from my group’s growing networks with Indigenous populations across India to study the impact of
dietary and subsistence transitions – so-called ‘westernization’ of traditionalist diets - on the gut microbiome.
Ultimately, through the implementation of these complementary themes set within the context of South Asian
populations, this research program will contribute towards our overall understanding of the evolutionary
mechanisms that underlie health and disease among human populations. Importantly, data and results from
our research will address critical representational gaps in the genomics literature and make precision medicine
efforts more universal and diverse in their application, especially for a region that, in light of being one of the
most populous regions with the largest diaspora, contributes substantially to the global disease burden."
10838492,"I propose to elucidate mechanisms mediated by High Mobility Group A1 (HMGA1) chromatin regulators
in disease progression in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). MPN are blood diseases caused by
mutations in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) which lead to clonal expansion. Individuals with
MPN are at increased risk for transformation to bone marrow fibrosis (myelofibrosis or MF) and leukemia, both
of which are associated with poor clinical outcomes. However, mechanisms underlying progression remain
poorly understood. The most common genetic lesion causing MPN is a mutation in Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2), the
obligate tyrosine kinase of hematopoietic growth factor receptors. This mutation (denoted JAK2V617F) causes
enhanced phosphorylation of the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (STAT3), resulting in
uncontrolled production of blood cells. Importantly, inhibiting JAK/STAT signaling improves symptoms but does
not prevent progression. Here, I focus on HMGA1 as a key mediator of JAK/STAT signaling in MPN progression.
Our scientific premise that HMGA1 fosters progression in MPN is based on the following compelling
preliminary results: 1) HMGA1 is a chromatin regulator that “opens” chromatin to induce STAT3 and other
genes involved in clonal expansion in human blood cell progenitors. 2) Blocking JAK/STAT signaling in MPN
cells decreases HMGA1, suggesting that JAK/STAT signals induce HMGA1, and HMGA1 feeds forward to
amplify STAT3 signals. 3) Hmga1 overexpression causes clonal expansion in mouse blood cell progenitors,
which evolves to leukemia with aging. 4) Hmga1 deficiency mitigates progression in mice with JAK2V617F MPN.
5) In human JAK2V617F mutant MPN cells, HMGA1 is required for proliferation, clonogenicity, and leukemia
engraftment in mice. 6) HMGA1 increases in human HSPC with MPN progression to MF or leukemia. 7) HMGA1
regulates gene networks involved in cell cycle progression and immune evasion in MPN based on RNA
sequencing results. 8) HMGA1 is also linked to gene networks associated with abnormal growth and immune
evasion in solid tumors and other hematologic cancers. Together, these intriguing results support the
following hypotheses: 1) HMGA1 cooperates with STAT3 to foster clonal expansion, immune evasion, and
MPN progression, 2) HMGA1 drives progression through gene networks involved in proliferation and immune
function, 3) Targeting HMGA1 and STAT3 will prevent clonal expansion, immune evasion, and MPN progression.
Aims/Approach: To test this, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To determine whether HMGA1 and
STAT3 generate a feed-forward loop to promote MPN progression, 2) To determine how HMGA1 alters the
immune response in MPN, 3) To begin to test the therapeutic efficacy of targeting both HMGA1 and STAT3 to
prevent aberrant clonal expansion, immune evasion, and MPN progression.
Impact: We expect to elucidate mechanisms inducing HMGA1 and downstream pathways in MPN. This work
should also reveal novel approaches to treat, or even prevent, progression in patients with MPN."

There is an urgent need to gain a greater understanding of basic biological mechanisms in autism spectrum
disorders (ASDs) as a path to discover new therapeutic targets. In this proposal, we aim to leverage cutting-
edge genomic technologies together with the unique advantages of zebrafish to investigate the effect of loss of
function of two top ASD risk genes, CHD8 and SCN2A, on translation regulation in the developing brain. Our
central goal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which loss of function of these genes affects translation
in both neurons and glia, predisposing to cell type-specific deficits. Our central hypothesis is that ASD
gene disruption will lead to alterations in the global translatome in the developing vertebrate brain, predisposing
to cell type-specific abnormalities. This hypothesis is based on our compelling preliminary data demonstrating
that translation is a significantly dysregulated pathway in whole-brain RNA-seq of zebrafish mutants of three top
ASD risk genes, all of which display robust behavioral, brain structural and activity phenotypes. To test this
hypothesis, we will perform Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification sequencing (TRAP-seq) using a novel
zebrafish Ribo-Tag transgenic line to evaluate actively translated mRNAs in neurons and glia derived from whole
brains of zebrafish mutants of chd8 and scn1lab (Aim 1), and single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to characterize
cell type-specific differences in mutants (Aim 2). We expect that our highly innovative and exploratory approach
will provide new insights into how two top ASD risk genes affect translation regulation and cell type composition
in the developing vertebrate brain. The expected outcome of this research is to advance our understanding of
translation as a central regulatory mechanisms underlying ASDs. This research will advance the field by
illuminating a novel targetable pathway downstream of ASD genes with potential therapeutic implications."

 Food allergy (FA) is a substantial US public health problem, affecting over 30 million people, 1-3 causing 81%
of pediatric anaphylaxis. 4 Outside of rescue medication and avoidance, current FA treatment is limited with no
long-lasting therapeutics. Normally, IgE producing B cells and plasma cells are minor population with minimal
IgE production. Dysregulation of these cells causes excessive IgE production, a key pathological mechanism
of FA anaphylactic shock. FA is highly diverse. Peanut and tree nut allergies (PNA and TNA) are most severe,
rarely outgrown, and often co-exist.5,6 Cross reactivity among tree nut (TN) further increase the risk of reactions
complicate current practice. Despite decades of awareness about the centrality of allergen-specific IgE in food
anaphylaxis7, inhibiting IgE production by B cells/plasma remains a major challenge. Omalizumab, the anti-
IgE antibody, “traps” IgE but does not target production. Oral immunotherapy (OIT), including Palforzia® for
peanut (PN) OIT, may paradoxically increase IgE.8-13 Therefore, novel therapeutics should address broad FA
and be orally administered with sustainable suppression of food specific IgE and anaphylaxis after stopping
treatment.
 We, for the first time, demonstrated that a small molecule compound berberine (BBR), isolated from
Philodendron cortex, inhibited IgE production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from FA patients
at very low doses.14 real clinical barrier to use of BBR use is poor oral bioavailability.15-17 We further
developed an innovative nanoparticle-based formulation, named NIT-X. Preliminary data showed oral NIT-X
is significantly more bioavailable than parent compound with an excellent preclinical safety profile (no adverse
effects found after feeding 14x effective daily dose), and that in PN-sensitized mice 4-weeks of once-a-day oral
NIT-X at 2mg BBR within the nano particle (equivalent to a human dose of 0.3g/day, based on body surface
area18) reduced 95-100% PN-specific IgE and 100% PN anaphylaxis with effects lasting at least 28 weeks post
treatment, without affecting IgG and IgA levels. IgE+ B cells and IgE+ plasma cells were reduced nearly to
normal. An ongoing experiment showed NIT-X also worked in cashew (CSH) and walnut (WN) allergy in
addition to PN allergy in murine model. We therefore hypothesize that NIT-X, as non-food restricted
therapeutic intervention, will be effective, theoretically, for all FA by restoring normal IgE regulation. The goal
of this 2-year R21 grant is to explore NIT-X as a novel therapeutic to resolve multiple FA focusing on and
nearly all TN allergy and explore its mechanisms possibly normalize IgE regulation. Aim # 1: Determine long-
term protection against IgE-mediated anaphylaxis in PN and multi-TN allergies by NIT-X, and Aim #2:
Identify the mechanisms contributing to sustained suppression of IgE production by NIT-X. Successful
completion of this proposal would provide a strong rationale to further investigate NIT-X as a safe and effective
treatment even for those with multi-food allergies or high reaction risk. Non-food-restricted NIT-X therapy may
change the course of FA by restoration of IgE regulation, and advance clinical practice."
10810695,"Prostate cancer patients acquire resistance to standard-of-care strategies progressing to advanced disease and
resulting in 350,000 yearly deaths. As acquired resistance is mediated by increased androgen receptor (AR)
expression, we are developing a “Bipolar Androgen” therapy (BAT) cycling serum testosterone from
supraphysiological to near-castrate levels, maximizing toxicity to high and low AR-expressing cells respectively.
BAT is a clinically effective, safe and unique approach to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)
patients that improves quality of life, produces biochemical and objective responses, and re-sensitizes tumors to
AR inhibitors. Our data from a recent clinical trial (NCT03554317) shows that prostate tumor cells produce
inflammatory cytokines following BAT, and patients who benefited most from this therapy have an enriched
inflammatory transcriptional signature in tumors. Thus, despite its conception as a “targeted” therapy, our
understanding of BAT has broadened to consider its effects on the immune system, which appears critical for
success. To capitalize on this unappreciated potential and bridge the gap between patients who benefitted or
not from this novel strategy, we characterized patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) before and
after treatment with BAT to define the changes it induces in immune cells. Our observations indicate that BAT
elicits the expansion of monocytic-myeloid derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) in patients with poor therapy
responses. The association between the abundance of M-MDSCs and reduced therapeutic efficacy, the
precedent in the literature that testosterone dampens the pro-inflammatory phenotype of macrophages, plus the
critical role of the inflammatory response in controlling tumor growth following BAT, lead us to the hypothesis
that increased numbers of M-MDSCs induced by BAT restrict antitumor immunity leading to reduced therapeutic
efficacy. To test this hypothesis, we propose three aims: (1) we will characterize PBMCs from metastatic CRPC
patients treated with BAT utilizing next generation sequencing, to identify transcriptional signatures in M-MDSCs
that are associated with therapeutic response and model M-MDSC tumor engraftment as these cells contribute
to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment; (2) we will use high dimensional flow cytometry to
demonstrate that immunosuppressive M-MDSCs are induced by BAT and not by standard-of-care therapy in an
independent cohort of patients, and describe the mechanism behind this induction by exposing isolated human
PBMCs in vitro to supraphysiological levels of testosterone; (3) we will utilize mouse models of prostate cancer
to assess the therapeutic benefit of M-MDSC depletion in combination with BAT. This collaborative effort across
the disciplines of computational biology, oncology, and myeloid cell biology, will build a detailed understanding
of how BAT reprograms tumor immunity and determine if M-MDSCs expansion underpins resistance to BAT,
thus providing a target to improve therapeutic efficacy in the design of future clinical trials."
10839811,"Among millions of comatose cases per year, brainstem injury-induced coma shows a high death rate and a high
chance for patients remaining in a permanent vegetative state. For those who recovered consciousness, the
longer patients remain in a coma the poorer outcomes of their recovery. How to promote acute coma recovery
in a serious unmet need. Yet, although neuro-glio-vascular (NGV) restoration is crucial for acute coma recovery,
detailed NGV signaling, e.g. astrocytic function, and circuit-based mechanisms underlying NGV restoration have
not been thoroughly investigated in comatose patients due to inherent technical difficulties. We have recently
developed a brainstem coma rat model, providing an unprecedented opportunity to enable mechanistic studies
of coma recovery within an acute 12 hour time window, during which novel therapeutic interventions are of
translational interest to patients with brainstem injuries. Our goal here is to elucidate the mechanistic regulation
of NGV restoration underlying acute coma recovery. We will target the thalamocortical circuit with optogenetic
tools to elucidate circuit-specific mechanisms underlying NGV restoration during acute coma recovery. To study
NGV restoration, we will combine functional MRI with multi-channel fiber photometry-based Calcium (Ca2+) and
glutamate (Glu) recordings. This multi-modal fMRI platform reveals that central thalamic activation is coupled
with Intrinsic Astrocytic Ca2+ (IAC) transients during arousal fluctuation. This novel observation leads us to test
a central hypothesis that the thalamic regulation of IAC-specific NGV restoration underlies the acute coma re-
covery. Three specific aims will be assessed: 1). To test the hypothesis that arousal-related NGV signaling is
associated with acute coma recovery. 2). To test the hypothesis that thalamic stimulation promotes acute coma
recovery via IAC-specific NGV signaling. 3). To test the hypothesis that Glu-astrocyte signaling underlies the
thalamic regulation of IAC-specific NGV restoration during acute coma recovery. We hope that the first glimpse
of IAC-specific NGV restoration will help refine the therapeutic paradigm to target astrocyte function to promote
acute coma recovery. Our proposal is a timely convergence of novel brainstem coma rat model, advanced multi-
modal imaging technologies, and growing insights of NGV signaling, opening an unprecedented window into
investigating circuit-based mechanisms that underlie NGV restoration in acute coma recovery."

 This purpose of this research proposal is to support the development of Palak Shah, MD, MS into an
independent investigator, and to conduct novel, transformative explorations of circulating, cell-free microRNAs
(ccf-miR) in heart transplantation. Circulating, cell-free miRs may serve as non-invasive biomarkers of allograft
rejection and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), two leading causes of morbidity and mortality in heart
transplant recipients. The candidate, Dr. Shah, has demonstrated his long-standing commitment to academic
medicine by pursuing a Masters in Clinical and Translational Research. As a junior faculty member, Dr. Shah’s
early work has focused on the identification of blood-based biomarkers to better manage patients with
advanced heart failure, left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), and following transplantation. The K23 award
will extend initial experiences in genomic assay development and biomarker validation to include: 1) isolation
of ccf-miRs from blood samples and preparation of biospecimens for next-generation sequencing; 2) sequence
data alignment and bioinformatic interpretation of sequence data; and 3) the development of a clinical panel of
ccf-miR biomarkers to detect allograft rejection using biostatistical analyses that combine transcriptomic and
clinical data.
 To accomplish these goals, a comprehensive career development plan has been formulated that includes
both formal coursework and mentored research under the close supervision and guidance of a senior team of
experienced mentors. The mentorship team includes multiple thought-leaders with detailed expertise relevant
to the career goals of the applicant: Christopher O’Connor, MD (clinical validation of heart failure biomarkers
and trial design), Jun Zhu, PhD (RNA-sequencing and bioinformatic analyses), Hannah Valantine, MD (cardiac
transplantation and genomic biomarkers), and Christopher deFilippi, MD (cardiovascular biomarker discovery
and validation). The specific aims of the research are to 1) Determine the ccf-miR transcriptome of cardiac
transplant recipients to identify novel miR biomarkers that distinguish cardiac allograft rejection; 2) Distinguish
ccf-miR biomarkers of chronic rejection manifest as cardiac allograft vasculopathy.
 Previous groundwork and training have prepared Dr. Shah to successfully undertake the proposed
research, and to transition him into an independent investigator. The study results are expected to establish a
framework for using ccf-miRs as diagnostic biomarkers of allograft rejection and CAV. Once clinically validated
in a future multicenter study, ccf-miRs can be used to non-invasively diagnose allograft rejection and CAV in
heart transplant patients."

Invasive aspergillosis is devastating fungal infection and the most common form of mold pneumonia worldwide,
with an estimated 200,000 cases annually. Aspergillus fumigatus, the most common etiologic agent of invasive
aspergillosis, forms ubiquitous airborne spores that humans inhaled on daily basis. In immune competent
individuals the respiratory innate immune system prevents the formation of tissue-invasive hyphae, a critical
immunologic checkpoint. In patients with hematologic malignancies, in bone marrow and lung transplant
recipients, and recently, in intensive care unit patients with COVID-19, numeric or functional defects in innate
immune function lead to invasive disease. Despite contemporary antifungal drugs, mortality rates remain at 20-
40% in high risk groups, underscoring the need for improved understanding of the molecular and cellular basis
of sterilizing immunity to advance immune-based adjunctive approaches.
In the second funding period, we harnessed a fungal bioreporter that reports the mode of cell death to discover
that neutrophils and monocyte-derived dendritic cells induce a regulated cell death in engulfed fungal cells.
The concept that a higher eukaryote can exploit a regulated cell death machinery in a lower eukaryote is novel
and, in the case of A. fumigatus, depends on host NADPH oxidase activity. NADPH oxidase-dependent fungal
killing is modulated by two novel, essential intercellular crosstalk circuits that involves the early production of
GM-CSF (GM-CSF circuit) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC circuit).
During the next project period, we propose to gain a deeper understanding of the GM-CSF and pDC circuits. In
Aim 1, we identify the essential cellular source of GM-CSF and, based on preliminary data, focus on pulmonary
endothelial and epithelial cells as regulators of neutrophil-dependent fungal killing. In Aim 2, we define the pDC
circuit and candidate transmitters and test models of direct or indirect activation by fungal cells or the lung
inflammatory milieu. In Aim 3, we define the mechanisms by which the pDC circuit regulates neutrophils, and
test its role in NAPDH oxidase assembly, activation, and neutrophil metabolism via the pentose phosphate
pathway and its cooperativity with the GM-CSF circuit to mediate sterilizing immunity. The proposed studies
are significant and innovative because they integrate innate immune crosstalk between the pulmonary
endothelial, epithelial, and pDC compartments and infected myeloid phagocytes into a comprehensive model
of respiratory immunity against mold pathogens. Understanding the induction, regulation, and participants of
innate immune crosstalk addresses a critical knowledge gap that will inform immune-enhancing strategies in
vulnerable patient groups."
10849864,"ABSTRACT
 Genetically-determined mutations that affect the sequence of keratin proteins account for a large
number of skin epithelial disorders, many of which are rooted in defective cellular mechanics. Keratins are the
most abundant proteins in surface epithelia like epidermis, where they primarily occur as intricate cytoplasmic
networks of 10 nm wide intermediate filaments (IFs). Keratins are encoded by an evolutionarily conserved
family of 54 genes subdivided into two major types (I and II). Pairwise regulation of type I and II keratin genes
in epithelial cells reflects a strict heteropolymerization requirement during IF assembly. Specific pairs of keratin
genes are regulated in an epithelial tissue-type and differentiation-specific fashion. One of the many roles so
far elucidated for keratin IFs is to act as resilient yet pliable scaffolds that endow epithelial cells and tissues
with the ability to sustain various stresses.
 A newly emerging, exciting role for keratin proteins is to regulate epithelial differentiation through the
modulation of Hippo and Notch signaling. We recently discovered that keratin-dependent disulfide bonding
plays a crucial role towards the intracellular organization and steady-state dynamics of keratin filaments in
progenitor keratinocytes of epidermis, with an associated impact on the balance between proliferation and
differentiation. This role entails a delicate interplay between disulfide bonding mediated by a specific residue
known as the “stutter cysteine” in keratin 14 (K14), the adaptor protein 14-3-3sigma, and YAP1, a terminal
effector of Hippo signaling. Since the stutter cysteine in K14 is conserved in several additional type I keratins
expressed in skin epithelia we propose, as an overarching hypothesis, that keratins act as general regulators
of Hippo signaling with an associated impact on differentiation and homeostasis in skin epithelia. In Aim 1, we
will test the hypothesis that the stutter cysteine in K10 is responsible for proper regulation of YAP1 and Hippo
signaling in the differentiating layers of epidermis, with direct relevance for the keratin disorder epidermolytic
hyperkeratosis. In Aim 2 we will map the binding interface between 14-3-3sigma and each of K14 and K10,
define the basis for the regulation the keratin/14-3-3 interactions, and identify the source of the signal that
drives K14- and K10-dependent disulfide bonding in keratinocytes. We will also conduct a high-throughput
screen comparing gene expression, at the single cell level, in control vs. Krt14 C373A transgenic mice, which
exhibit an epidermal differentiation defect coupled to misregulation of YAP1. In Aim 3, finally, we will test the
hypothesis that the stutter cysteine in K17 regulates YAP1 and Hippo signaling and the balance between
proliferation and differentiation in hair follicles, sweat glands, tooth, and possibly in other appendages, with
relevance for the disorder pachyonychia congenita. The proposed body of work lies on a robust premise and is
poised to significantly advance our understanding of the significance of keratin protein function and regulation
in vivo and the pathophysiology of keratin mutation-based skin diseases."

Tuberculosis (TB) kills around 2 million people each year and is a major cause of mortality from a single
infectious disease worldwide. Emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR) is now a major problem in
more than 60 countries of the world. MDR-TB is therefore a disease, where novel intervention strategies
including ‘therapeutic vaccines’ are required to supplement available drug regimen. A characteristic
feature of lung tuberculosis is the granuloma, which is collection of immune cells including T cells,
neutrophils, DCs, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and macrophages (MФs) surrounding a central core
of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infected macrophages (MФs). Granulomas restrict the growth of
MTB and continuously recruit immune cells. Macrophages are in turn, the major phagocytic cells which
kill MTB. We discovered two novel mechanisms through which MTB can be killed during tuberculosis.
First, we found that human pro-inflammatory M1-MФs expressed nitric oxide (NO) and up-regulated
autophagy to kill MTB whereas, anti-inflammatory M2-MФs allowed the growth of MTB due to a decrease
in NO synthesis and autophagy. Secondly, we discovered that, BCG vaccine and MTB infected
mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) reprogrammed naïve human macrophages to become M1 phenotype
and more activated to kill MTB. Interestingly, Phase I trials using naïve, autologous MSCs have improved
the health of MDR-TB patients. In this proposal, we will leverage our new findings to increase human
macrophage activation through stem cell-mediated immunotherapeutic vaccine as follows. Specific Aim-
1: Investigate the molecular mechanisms through which, BCG vaccine and MTB infected or conditioned
human mesenchymal stem cells to epigenetically program naive human macrophages. Specific Aim-2:
Investigate the in vivo therapeutic and prophylactic effects of conditioned MSCs during experimental
tuberculosis. We will analyze the ability of transfused MSCs to eradicate bacteria and restore lung
function. MSCs have been used in more than 300 clinical transfusion trials to control cancer,
autoimmune diseases and inflammation. We will develop a new method of stem cell therapeutic
vaccination to control MDR-TB."
10853035,"Project Summary/Abstract
Ovarian cancer (OvCa) has an overall poor prognosis due in part to high rates of metastasis at the time of
diagnosis and few targeted therapeutic options. Microtubule targeted agents (MTAs), including the taxane
paclitaxel (PTX), are some of the most effective agents used for the treatment of women’s cancers, including
both breast and OvCas. Although PTX is often effective during the initial phase of treatment, the development
of resistance is a significant limitation to long-term anticancer efficacy. MTAs are collectively classified as
antimitotic agents; however, different drugs of this class have shown distinct effects on oncogenic signaling
pathways with notable differences demonstrated particularly between microtubule stabilizers, like PTX, and
microtubule destabilizers, such as the vinca alkaloids. Additionally, there is an opportunity to develop new
classes of MTAs that can circumvent well-established mechanisms of taxane resistance, including the
upregulation of drug efflux transporters. I hypothesize that the development of microtubule stabilizers that
circumvent clinically relevant mechanisms of taxane resistance, as well as the identification of biomarkers that
can be used to direct the more rational choice among different agents of this clinically validated and
mechanistically diverse class of drugs, will provide improved options for patients with taxane-resistant OvCa.
To complete my dissertation, I will use a combination of molecular and cellular biology, bioinformatics, and in
vitro and in vivo cancer pharmacology to identify key determinants for the targeted use of distinct MTAs for the
treatment of drug-resistant OvCa (F99 phase). I will test the hypothesis that the taccalonolide class of covalent
microtubule stabilizers will retain efficacy in locally disseminated, taxane-resistant OvCa models. Additionally, I
will follow up on findings that the Septin 9 isoform 1 (Sept9_i1) oncogene is differentially localized upon
treatment with microtubule stabilizers and destabilizers to test the hypothesis that Sept9_i1 can serve as a
biomarker for the differential response to these drugs, particularly in EGFR-driven breast and OvCas. In the
K00 phase, I will expand my training into the area of metabolic disorders to elucidate the molecular
mechanisms of adipocyte-mediated taxane resistance in OvCa. I will build on studies that demonstrate PTX
promotes IL-8 production in adipocytes due to its ability to directly activate the inflammatory TLR4 signaling
pathway and test the hypothesis that structurally distinct MTAs that do not activate TLR4 signaling will
circumvent this resistance mechanism both in vitro and in vivo, which could be used to inform on more rational
use of particular MTAs in subsets of women with OvCa. The proposed research will utilize an effective, but
mechanistically underappreciated, class of drugs to determine mechanisms underlying taxane resistance that
will guide future therapeutic choices. The research and career training provided by this F99/K00 mechanism
will provide me an opportunity to smoothly transition from my predoctoral research to a postdoctoral fellowship
and, ultimately, into an independent investigator with a focus on drug-resistance in women’s cancers."

The lymphatic system is an integral part of the circulatory system, where extracellular fluid flows from vascular
capillaries into the lymphatic vessels and is returned to the vascular system via the thoracic duct. Additionally,
lymphatic vessels regulate homeostasis of tissue fluid, absorption of dietary fat, and trafficking of immune cells.
Consequently, dysfunction in lymphatic vessels is associated with development of many diseases, including
obesity and metabolic disease, aging and Alzheimer’s disease, chronic wound and cancer, as well as
inflammation and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, controlling lymphatic vascular formation and augmenting
its function is postulated as a promising therapeutic target for preventing and treating these debilitating diseases.
Unfortunately, therapeutic lymphangiogenesis has not been widely explored partly due to the unavailability of a
clinically-relevant cell source and controllable matrix environment. The overall goal of the research program is
to derive lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and lymphatic muscle cells (LMCs) from human pluripotent stem
cells (hPSCs) that can be used as a clinically-relevant cell source for modeling lymphatic function and physiology,
as well as therapeutic lymphangiogenesis in a synthetic and controllable matrix environment. To this end, our
lab is at the forefront of developing multi-disciplinary approaches to utilize stem cells and synthetic biomaterials
for basic understanding of stem cell differentiation and lymphatic vessel morphogenesis, as well as approaches
in therapeutic lymphangiogenesis. We have recently established xeno-free, well-defined and controllable
differentiation protocols to direct hPSCs differentiation to clinically-relevant vascular progenitor cells with high
reproducibility and efficiency, as well as wide clinical applicability. Furthermore, synthetic matrices can be used
to provide spatial and temporal control for these progenitor cells to undergo lymphatic vascular morphogenesis,
useful for basic understanding of lymphatic vascular biology and a range of therapeutic applications. These
results establish a fundamental link between vascular and lymphatic morphogenesis within synthetic matrices.
We are currently focused on bridging the large knowledge gap between molecular understanding of vascular
and lymphatic differentiation and morphogenesis in a developmental context. Furthermore, we are also testing
the impact of lymphatic vasculature to attenuate inflammatory response, prevent edema, and eventually promote
tissue regeneration in a wound healing model. Cumulatively, we are combining approaches in stem cell and
bioengineering, biomaterials and microfluidics, as well as lymphatic and systems biology to develop the
necessary component in therapeutic lymphangiogenesis: reliable human cell sources from hPSCs within a
biologically rational synthetic and controllable matrix environment. Collectively, this research has the potential to
not only advance our basic understanding of lymphatic vasculatures in health and disease, but also to
revolutionize the way we manage and treat a myriad of diseases that will benefit from innovative therapeutic
lymphangiogenesis."
10839417,"In the more than 40 years since the discovery of the Ebola virus (EBOV) there has been an increase in both the frequency, size, and duration of Ebola outbreaks. The 2014-2016 outbreak that devastated West Africa evolved within the span of months into a global humanitarian crisis, infecting over 28,600 people and killing more than 11,300 - eclipsing all previous outbreaks combined. Moreover, in the six years since the end of the West African Ebola epidemic, there have been seven additional outbreaks in Guinea and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The recurrence of Ebola in Guinea and the DRC and the detection of the Ebola virus in a bat in Liberia, make it clear that this pathogen is persistent and will be the cause of recurrent outbreaks of varying scales across West and Central Africa. While the West African epidemic has ended, the clinical concerns of EVD survivors persist including the longevity of immune protection against repeat infection and the mechanisms underlying the persistent and debilitating somatic complaints reported by an overwhelming majority. The primary objective of this proposal is a rigorous characterization of the protective and pathologic effects of the EVD survivor immune response in one of the largest EVD survivor cohorts. Specifically:
•	AIM I will characterize the humoral immune response to EBOV infection by measuring antibody levels and neutralizing capacity - a key correlate of protection, and assessing the memory immune response in seronegative EVD survivors from 1 to 10 years following acute infection
•	AIM II will investigate autoimmune activation as a mechanism underlying post-Ebola complications
We will conduct this work in the context of close and strong working relationships with healthcare leaders and Ebola survivor representatives in West Africa, and well-developed infrastructure for clinical research that we have established in Liberia and Sierra Leone where we have recruited, enrolled, and longitudinally followed and sampled more than 700 EVD survivors and over 1,000 household contacts. The proposed work will provide a much-needed longitudinal characterization of the humoral immune response, evaluation of the memory immune response to EBOV infection, and investigation of autoimmune activation as a mechanism underlying the long- term complications of surviving EVD. With seven outbreaks, including the second largest Ebola outbreak ever, occurring in the 6 years since the West African epidemic, the question is not if another large outbreak will occur but when. This study will ensure that the world is better prepared for the next epidemic through an improved understanding of the durability of the humoral immune response to infection, an improved understanding of the clinical complications of EVD, and through the implementation of clinical research platforms in areas that are
likely to see a recurrence of EVD."
10835887,"Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain, acts at eight metabotropic glutamate (mGlu)
subtypes, expressed in a partially overlapping fashion in distinct brain circuits. Recent evidence indicates that
specific mGlu receptor protomers can heterodimerize and exhibit dramatically different pharmacology when
compared to their homomeric counterparts. These findings open important possibilities for more selective ligand
modulation of mGlu receptor biology in the brain.
 To define mGlu heterodimer-specific pharmacology, we developed a technique termed CODA-RET
(Complemented Donor Acceptor-Resonance Energy Transfer), in which only a defined dimeric pair of receptors
induces a signal upon receptor activation. CODA-RET can be used in either homodimer or heterodimer mode,
such that activating ligands with differential pharmacology at homo- vs. heterodimers can be revealed. We have
used CODA-RET in the context of an mGlu2/4 heteromer to demonstrate that an mGlu2 negative allosteric
modulator (NAM) can block the response to an mGlu4-specific agonist across the dimer interface. Furthermore,
we showed that, while one structural class of mGlu4 positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) can potentiate both
mGlu4/4 homomers and mGlu2/4 heterodimers, another class of mGlu4 PAMs potentiates only mGlu4/4 homomers.
We used these pharmacological tools to identify input-specific pharmacology in specific neuronal circuits, with
effects consistent with mGlu2/4 heterodimers at corticostriatal and thalamocortical synapses, versus mGlu4/4
receptors at striatopallidal synapses, providing an opportunity for more precise pharmacological intervention.
 In mice, evoked excitatory currents and induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) at Schaffer Collateral-CA1
(SC-CA1) synapses in the hippocampus are blocked by the selective mGlu7 negative allosteric modulator (NAM),
ADX71743. In contrast, the mGlu7 NAM MMPIP, with a similar profile to ADX71743 in heterologous cells
expressing mGlu7 homomers, fails to block these responses in brain slices. We hypothesized that this might
result from heteromerization of mGlu7 with another mGlu receptor protomer. Since an mGlu8 pharmacology has
also been reported at SC-CA1 synapses, we used CODA-RET to study mGlu7/8 heterodimers in vitro and found
that ADX71743 blocks responses of both mGlu7/7 homodimers and mGlu7/8 heterodimers, whereas MMPIP
only antagonizes responses at mGlu7/7 homodimers. Using these compounds, as well as genetic knockout
of mGlu8, we will test the hypothesis that a receptor with a pharmacological signature consistent with an mGlu7/8
heterodimer is functionally expressed in the hippocampus. Our aims are: 1) To define the pharmacological
profiles of mGlu7 allosteric ligands at glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses in area CA1 of the
hippocampus. 2) To test the hypothesis that mGlu7/8 heterodimers lead to the MMPIP-insensitive
phenotype in SC-CA1 responses. 3) To elucidate the activation mechanism and signaling properties of
mGlu7/7 homodimers, mGlu8/8 homodimers, and mGlu7/8 heterodimers using CODA-RET."
10805447,"Abstract
Almost all sympathetic outflow control pathways travel through the spinal cord for affecting the peripheral tissues.
Cervical spinal cord injury impacts sympathetic outflow control, leading to several debilitating deficits (in addition
to paralysis), including an inability to redistribute blood to active tissues and muscle fatigue. There are currently
no consistently effective treatments for sympathetic outflow control dysfunction following cervical spinal cord
injury. The long-term goal of this research is to address this significant gap using vagus nerve stimulation paired
with rehabilitation to enhance sympathetic outflow control following cervical spinal cord injury. Pairing vagus
nerve stimulation with movements during rehabilitation leads to the rapid release of plasticity enhancing
neuromodulators, leading to the reorganization of motor control systems. The objective of this proposal is to
determine the specific effects of vagus nerve stimulation paired with rehabilitation on sympathetic outflow control
following cSCI, and determine the neural pathways contributing to these effects. We will also assess the optimal
delivery regime for vagus nerve stimulation (with or without rehabilitation). Our central hypothesis is that vagus
nerve stimulation precisely paired with movements during rehabilitation enhances the plasticity of spared
sympathetic outflow control circuits, leading to improved motor endurance and muscle fatigue resistance
following cSCI. We will assess this hypothesis via three specific aims: 1) determine the effects of vagus nerve
stimulation paired with rehabilitation on forelimb muscle and cardiovascular function; and measure changes in
2) cortical and 3) subcortical plasticity related to sympathetic outflow control. We will pursue these aims using
multidisciplinary assessments, leveraging electrophysiological and neuroanatomical techniques. The proposed
research is significant, as it will determine if vagus nerve stimulation paired with rehabilitation is a viable therapy
for treating sympathetic control dysfunction following cervical spinal cord injury. Furthermore, these results will
elucidate the critical relationships between forelimb function, sympathetic outflow control, vagus nerve
stimulation therapy, and neuroplasticity."
10899684,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) are the most effective weight (wt) loss
procedures for severe obesity. Our lab recently showed decreased brain reward activation to high energy
dense (HED) vs low energy dense (LED) food cues following both SG and RYGB. The reward activation
changes, however, have not been correlated with changes in actual intake of HED or LED foods. There is also
recent concerning evidence of increased alcohol intake and new onset alcohol use disorder (AUD) by 2 y
postsurgery. Although there are overlapping neural reward pathways underlying food intake and alcohol use,
the mechanisms behind increased alcohol intake postsurgery remain unknown. There is, however, evidence of
more rapid alcohol absorption in both SG and RYGB, which could be a factor in increased alcohol intake.
Alcohol absorption, however, has not been studied over time postsurgery to link it to increased alcohol intake
or AUD. To investigate the neurobiological mechanisms, we will conduct a study of three groups of 70 each:
SG, RYGB, and a nontreatment (NT) group, matched for baseline BMI, sex, age, and alcohol intake, at
presurgery, 1 y (when body weight tends to stabilize), and 2 y postsurgery (when alcohol intake increases).
Although weight loss is similar for SG and RYGB, the surgeries differ anatomically, yet lead to similar
increased drinking, making them both worthwhile to study. Primary Aim 1: a) Determine neural responses to
visual cues of alcohol (ALC) and non-alcohol (NA) drinks as well as HED and LED foods. From pre to post
surgery, cue reactivity in 9 common reward ROIs to alcohol and food is expected to increase in response to
cues of ALC vs NA and decrease to HED vs LED. The changes are expected to manifest at 1 y and strengthen
at 2 y postsurgery. b) Relate changes in neural responses to ALC vs NA cues with changes in alcohol intake, #
AUD symptoms, and AUD status at 1 and 2 y. c) Test whether baseline reward activation to ALC vs NA cues
predicts increased postsurgical alcohol intake at 1 and 2 y. d) Compare for the above, the effects of (SG +
RYGB) vs NT (primary) and RYGB vs SG (secondary), expecting greater effects for RYGB than SG.
Primary Aim 2: a) Determine pharmacokinetics (PK) after 1 alcohol drink equivalent from blood alcohol
concentrations (BAC) at pre-drink, 2, 5, 15, 25, 35, 50, 65, 80 min post-drink. We expect that the surgical
groups will exhibit higher and sooner BAC peaks than NT, and that RYGB will result in higher and earlier peak
BAC than SG. b) Correlate changes in brain activation to ALC vs. NA cues in the common reward areas with
changes in BAC peak and time to peakpredict alcohol intake and AUD based on changes in BAC peak and
time to peak. The study results should enhance knowledge of neural mechanisms underlying the postsurgical
changes in alcohol and food intake, in association with changes in alcohol PK. This knowledge could lead to
development of new surgery procedures which do not lead to increased alcohol intake."
10832002,"GM-CSF, macrophages, and susceptibility to Mycobacterium abscessus pulmonary infection
Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) do not cause disease in healthy individuals; however, people with chronic
airways diseases are susceptible to developing pulmonary NTM infections (pNTM), which increase symptom
burden and accelerate lung function decline. How the healthy lung clears inhaled NTM and why individuals with
airways disease are at increased risk of developing pNTM remain poorly understood. Our long term goal is to
understand how macrophage heterogeneity contributes to chronic lung diseases. The objective of this grant is
to characterize events that occur when inhaled NTM initially interact with respiratory tract macrophages, and
determine how the cytokine granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) promotes clearance
of NTM. Data from human case reports and mice lacking GM-CSF (GM-CSFKO mice) indicate that GM-CSF is
essential for immune control of pNTM. We have chosen to study the role of GM-CSF in susceptibility to
Mycobacterium abscessus (MAbsc) as this species causes a significant portion of pNTM, is increasing in
prevalence, and is especially challenging to eradicate. Our data demonstrate that GM-CSF can activate
macrophages to kill MAbsc. In lung airspaces, macrophages can be grouped into two main categories: resident
alveolar macrophages (AlvMs) and recruited monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). AlvMs are constitutively
exposed to GM-CSF produced by alveolar epithelial cells. In contrast, most macrophages in airways of people
with chronic airways disease are MDMs recruited from the bloodstream, a compartment with low levels of GM-
CSF. Our central hypothesis is that macrophages must be activated by GM-CSF to eliminate NTM, and that
MDMs recruited to the airways in people with chronic airways disease are less effective at killing NTM than
AlvMs due to insufficient exposure to GM-CSF. We will investigate this hypothesis in three specific aims. Aim 1
will determine the mechanism by which GM-CSF enhances macrophage killing of MAbsc, testing the hypothesis
that GM-CSF promotes phagosomal maturation and phagolysosomal acidification. Using conditional knockout
mice that lack the GM-CSF receptor on different macrophage subsets, Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that resident
AlvMs programmed by GM-CSF are the essential cells responsible for control of MAbsc in the healthy lung. Aim
3 will employ a mouse model of airway infection using MAbsc-embedded agar beads to test the hypothesis that
there is insufficient GM-CSF in the airways to activate recruited MDMs to develop mycobacteriocidal phenotypes.
These studies are innovative, as they will determine the mechanisms by which GM-CSF enhances macrophage
killing of MAbsc, and reveal how location in the lung influences phenotypes of recruited MDMs. The results from
the proposed research will be significant, as they will inform use of immune therapies to treat non-resolving
infection in chronic lung diseases, and they could help predict which individuals with chronic lung diseases are
at highest risk for developing pNTM."
10890753,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an extremely aggressive malignancy with an overall 5-year survival
of 11%. Due to its asymptomatic nature and lack of methods for early detection, the majority of PDAC patients
(> 85%) present with non-localized tumors. This highlights the need to detect PDAC at an earlier, localized stage.
Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) and mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCN) offer a unique
opportunity to identify premalignant lesions to serve as targets for early detection strategies. Dr. Randall Brand
and others proposed a two-step surveillance approach for early detection of PDAC: 1) identification of high-risk
populations through clinical evaluation with an elevated PDAC prevalence close to or above 1% and 2)
development of serum biomarker(s), for repeated testing at intervals to detect subjects in surveillance with a
rising risk of PDAC (prevalence ~ 10%) for additional imaging. The goal of this proposal is to identify serum
biomarkers and develop in vitro diagnostic multivariate index assays (IVDMIAs) and incorporate them into an
“early detection through surveillance” workflow for the detection of early-stage PDAC and its precursor lesions.
The intended use of these IVDMIAs are 1) to assist in the clinical evaluation of high-risk subjects to be included
in surveillance for the early detection of PDAC, and 2) to detect rising risk of PDAC or high-risk IPMN in the
longitudinal evaluation of subjects in surveillance. The project has five specific aims: 1. To discover and develop
serum-based PDAC early detection biomarkers through integrated proteomic analysis of serum/tissue samples
from early-stage PDAC, IPMN, and benign and healthy controls using a multimodal and phased approach with
corroborative supporting evidence from tissue-based proteomic analysis and immunohistochemical (IHC)
verification. 2. To use a by-design approach driven by predefined intended uses that are both clinically
meaningful and practically feasible to develop and evaluate serum biomarkers for IVDMIAs. 3. To develop and
optimize multiplex analytical assays for selected biomarkers and apply them to generate high-quality biomarker
data for IVDMIA development and clinical evaluation. 4. To collect and assemble large clinical specimen sample
sets for both IVDMIA algorithm development and independent validation. 5. To participate in collaborative
activities with other PCDC-RUs. To be successful, the proposed project requires a multi-disciplinary, systems
approach and the support of critical technology, data science, and clinical specimen resources. Our team is a
unique ensemble of experts in PDAC and IPMN pathology for early detection, clinical chemistry/assay
development, clinical proteogenomics, and statistical/machine learning for IVDMIA development. Most
importantly, the team members individually and collectively all have a long-standing history of active research
with accomplishments in biomarker development and translation into clinical tests, including the first proteomic
IVDMIA test cleared by the FDA. We believe with these innovative yet practical approaches, our RU offers the
best opportunity to make significant contributions to the PCDC network and address critical clinical unmet needs."
10874579,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A hallmark of the nervous system is its ability to transform and combine multiple sources of information to guide
behavior, and to tune this signal processing through learning, for more accurate control of behavior. How this
adaptive signal processing is implemented by neural circuits remains largely unknown, due in part to the
presence of feedback loops that mix together and temporally shape neural signals in complex ways. This project
uses an interdisciplinary experimental-computational approach to dissect the signal processing operations
supporting the control of eye movements by vestibular and visual sensory inputs. Rigorous experimental
protocols, computational models, and statistical fitting approaches will be developed to characterize the signal
transformations occurring at multiple sites in the relevant neural circuitry, to disentangle the roles of feedforward
and feedback signals in the control of eye movement behavior. These approaches will be used to analyze how
specific changes in the way vestibular and visual signals are processed by the circuit support adaptive changes
in the amplitude and timing of the eye movement responses to these sensory inputs. By advancing our
understanding of how learning alters the way a circuit computes, this work bridges the key conceptual gap
between neural plasticity at the synaptic level and learning at the behavioral level, and provides a scientific
foundation for the development of improved clinical approaches for promoting recovery or replacement of
vestibular function."
10903704,"Project Summary
The U.S. registered nurse (RN) workforce is one of the largest in the Healthcare and Social Assistance Sector,
and at high risk for injuries and errors due to poor sleep and fatigue. Shift work (i.e., nights, evenings, rotating
shifts) can contribute to RNs not obtaining adequate, restful sleep. Work intensity, including heavy physical and
emotional workloads of caring for critically ill patients, can contribute to job stress, resulting in spill-over effects
at home when RNs experience difficulties falling and staying asleep. To address work and home sleep barri-
ers, this project proposes the development and pilot testing of RN-SLEEP, skill-building mobile application
designed to improve sleep. RN-SLEEP will provide a convenient, flexible space for RNs to learn evidence-
based shift work specific strategies, and cognitive-behavioral methods, (e.g., goalsetting, relaxation training) to
enhance sleep. Using NIOSH’s Research 2 Practice (R2P) approach, the study team will collaborate with par-
ticipants (N=18-24) from an RN union to refine RN-SLEEP content, integrating current sleep literature (includ-
ing National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health [NIOSH] material) with cognitive-behavioral based
training. RN-SLEEP will be pilot-tested using a two-group pretest-posttest study design, comparing sleep out-
come measures (duration, quality) of RN-SLEEP participant users’ (n=35) with participants from an education
control group (n=35). Data trends on behavior change (beliefs and self-efficacy) and other sleep outcome
measures (timing, regularity, efficiency, daytime sleepiness) will be explored. RN-SLEEP goals align with
Healthy People 2030, NIOSH strategic goal to promote safe and healthy work design and well-being,
through two NIOSH Healthcare and Social Assistance Sector/Healthy Work Design Cross-Sector
(HCSA/HWD) intermediate goals. HWD goal 7.2A is to conduct intervention research addressing fatigue
(poor sleep sequala) due to suboptimal work designs (shift work) in the healthcare industry. HCSA/HWD goal
7.12A prioritizes interventions designed to impact work and non-work contributors to safety and health. This
RN-SLEEP intervention aims to improve sleep through building skills that help RNs overcome obstacles to
sleep from work and home, thus improving health and safety. Immediate outputs include a mobile app, de-
signed and tested in collaboration with RNs, to improve sleep. Study results will be disseminated through our
union collaborators, nursing conferences and journal publications, and our University’s NIOSH sponsored Edu-
cation and Research Center social media outlets. Intermediate outcomes include enhancing RN sleep
through training rarely available in nursing school and traditional health and safety training programs. Improv-
ing sleep can reduce fatigue and may decrease occupational injuries and errors. RN-SLEEP is adaptable,
where future versions could be modified to meet the needs of other HCSA workers (i.e., nursing aides) and
workers in other industries (e.g., oil and gas) scheduled to work non-standard work hours. End outcomes in-
clude integrating RN-SLEEP into a broader hospital organization intervention to mitigate fatigue risks."

ADHD is a common neurodevelopmental disorder that includes attention difficulty, impulsivity, and
hyperactivity. The diagnosis is associated with many challenges to educational, occupational, and health
outcomes, particularly when untreated. Genetic studies of ADHD have the potential to clarify the disorder’s
biological underpinnings, its heterogeneity, and its relationship to other neuropsychiatric diagnoses. However,
genetic research into ADHD lags in terms of: (1) sample size, (2) ancestral diversity, and (3) consideration of
phenotypic heterogeneity. Akili is designed to address all three of these critical gaps. Akili (the Swahili term for
“mind”) will enroll 6,000 children in Kenya and South Africa – 4,000 with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD and
2,000 age- and ancestry-matched controls. All participants will complete a detailed behavioral, cognitive, and
medical phenotyping battery, and provide a DNA sample. We will genetically characterize all 6,000 participants
using exome sequencing and genome-wide genotyping, and make all Akili data and materials publicly
available through the NIMH. Akili data will nearly double the number of ADHD cases available for exome
sequencing analysis and provide a 20% addition to the current PGC-ADHD GWAS activity. It will be by far the
largest contributor of diverse ancestry data to either analysis. Akili will generate a research resource of
international value, and provide the first large-scale characterization of ADHD in the African context."
10894743,"Abstract
 Huntington disease (HD) is one of many neurodegenerative diseases wherein accumulation of misfolded,
aggregated protein is a pathogenic mechanism. HD is caused by polyglutamine expansions in the huntingtin
protein which make it and its naturally occurring exon 1 fragment (Httex1), more aggregation prone. We have
shown that Httex1 aggregation is a stepwise process, wherein the monomer gives rise to different aggregation
intermediates prior to formation of fibrils. Although there is good consensus that Httex1 aggregation plays a key
role in disease pathogenesis, less is known about the 3D structures of Httex1 aggregation intermediates and
how each conformer contributes to toxicity. A major obstacle in the field has been the difficulty in obtaining
homogeneous population of these conformers for their biochemical characterization. We have recently identified,
stably prepared, and characterized different different intermediates during Httex1 aggregation. We propose to
extend this work by determining the structure of key conformers (α-helical oligomer and unbundled fibril) and by
investigating different mechanism by which misfolding and toxicity can be inhibited. Using our array of different
conformers, we also expect to obtain detailed insight into the how chaperones recognize Httex1 conformers. By
combining EPR, solid-state and solution NMR, cryo-EM, and cell toxicity assays, our team is in a unique position
to successfully accomplish these goals. In Aim 1, we will combine EPR, NMR, cryo-EM and computational
refinement to determine the structure of unbundled fibrils from Httex1 proteins with different Q-lengths. By
learning about the structures of these toxic conformers, we enable future efforts aimed at finding biomarkers and
aggregation inhibitors. The structure of the earliest misfolding intermediate, the α-helical oligomer, will be
determined in Aim 2A. This will be done using EPR, solution NMR, and cryo-EM. We also obtained a fibril binder
from small, multimerized N17Q7 peptides which potently inhibits Httex1 aggregation. Specific aim 2B tests the
hypothesis that this binder inhibits aggregation by interfering with primary and/or secondary seeding. Moreover,
we will optimize the inhibitor and test its ability to protect from toxicity in a cellular setting. Specific aim 3
determines how chaperones recognize Httex1 misfolding. Using a combination of biochemical methods, EPR,
NMR and cryo-EM, we will identify the molecular mechanism by which chaperones (DNAJB1 and DNAJB6) bind
to Httex1 by determining which Httex1 conformers the they bind to and which epitope they are recognizing."
10766821,"Project Summary
The rise of antibiotic resistance among healthcare associated pathogens has created a public health
emergency and is a major challenge to the provision of effective medical care. Multidrug-resistant (MDR)
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is labeled as a serious threat by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
and disproportionately impacts medically vulnerable patients such as those in the intensive care unit. The
emergence of resistance to front-line antibiotics, including carbapenems and recently introduced β-lactam/β-
lactamase inhibitor combinations, has led to the use of alternate regimens with decreased efficacy and
increased toxicity. Cefiderocol (FDC) is a novel siderophore cephalosporin that retains in vitro activity against
MDR-P. aeruginosa. This antibiotic mimics the iron binding molecules P. aeruginosa requires for growth, and is
actively transported into the periplasmic space by proteins on the outer membrane of the bacteria called TonB
dependent receptors (TBDR). Resistance to FDC has been linked to a loss of expression of these TBDRs in
clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa. Further, an analysis of genomes of P. aeruginosa collected before the
approval of FDC found that mutations predicted to lead to decreased expression of TBDR genes were present
in carbapenem-resistant isolates. Using population analysis profiles (PAP), several strains of P. aeruginosa
with TBDR mutations showed heteroresistance to FDC, or growth of a small population of bacteria at antibiotic
concentrations above the clinical resistance breakpoint despite testing susceptible on standard susceptibility
testing. In two major specific aims, this proposal will investigate the hypothesis that mutations in TBDR genes
are present across clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa from diverse geographic areas and lead to the emergence
of resistance on exposure to FDC. In the first aim, the prevalence of TBDR gene mutations will be evaluated in
a collection of nearly one thousand carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa from the Prospective Observational
Pseudomonas study (POP). Alterations in this pathway will be linked to FDC susceptibility testing results, an
assessment of heteroresistance using PAP, and clinical features of P. aeruginosa colonization and infection. In
the second aim, we will investigate strategies to understand and mitigate the emergence of resistance
associated with TBDR mutations. First, a disk diffusion-based method to identify heteroresistant isolates will be
developed as a screening test for the clinical microbiology laboratory. Second, a hollow fiber infection model
simulating human pharmacokinetics of FDC will be used to evaluate the emergence of FDC resistance at
clinically relevant drug concentrations. This proposal will provide important information on the distribution and
prevalence of mutations associated with resistance to FDC in P. aeruginosa. The development of an assay to
identify isolates at risk of resistance, and an understanding of the mechanism by which resistance emerges at
human drug exposures, can form the basis for rational therapeutic use of FDC at the patient bedside."
10808103,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
When faced with treating a child with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), a heterogeneous chronic condition with
no known etiology or cure, there is no one-size fits all solution. Clinicians rely on their past experiences and
learnings from peers and the scientific community to make the best decision for JIA patients. Yet despite
multiple FDA approved treatments, only 40 percent of patients with a polyarticular form of JIA achieve a state
of controlled disease, it is hard to treat. While clinical expertise is invaluable, relying on clinician experience
alone at point of care (POC) when treating an uncommon (1 in 1000 children) and disabling disease with
heterogeneous presentation and variable treatment response may result in missing a critical window of
opportunity for early remission and suboptimal outcome. Imagine the power of a digital health technology
(DHT) that uses real world data to inform effectiveness of different treatment strategies for every child. By
learning collectively from past experiences of a network of providers and patients that leverage a shared
clinical data registry, the DHT synthesizes, and updates knowledge centered for the patient at the POC, while
considering the values and preferences of patients for shared decision-making (SDM). Currently, there is no
such DHT available to deliver the patient-centered comparative effectiveness evidence at the POC.
 This study aims to close such a gap with novel user-centered design to adapt for use at POC an
existing researcher facing application package based on advanced Bayesian causal learning methods applied
to real world electronic health record (EHR) data. This DHT, called PCATS.JIA (Patient centered adaptive
treatment strategies for JIA care) will be implemented within the setting of a 23-center learning health network.
In R21 phase, the study aims to: 1) bring the PCATS platform to the POC by developing a PCATS.JIA DHT
that is EHR system agnostic; 2) co-design a graphic user interface for PCATS.JIA as a patient-centered SDM
tool together with key stakeholders (patients, parents, and clinicians); and 3) pilot test PCATS.JIA as a SDM
tool at POC in a single rheumatology practice. In R33 phase, we will refine, test, and evaluate the PCATS.JIA
in three pediatric rheumatology clinics by 1) using quality improvement science and implementation science
principles to implement PCATS.JIA into the clinic workflow with high reliability; and 2) demonstrating that use
of PCATS will result in improved health care service as reflected in more patient-centered care, improved
health outcomes, and health equity.
 The study promises to deliver a novel patient centered DHT that is robust, flexible and improves quality
and equity of care and treatment outcomes as tested within the practice of pediatric rheumatology. Being EHR
system agonistic, it is scalable to different clinical centers. This DHT has the potential to be generalizable to
broader disease conditions and patient populations."

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Hepatitis B virus (HBV) share the same blood borne modes of
transmission, primarily through sexual contact and injection drug use and individuals at risk for HIV are also
at higher risk for HBV infection. Globally, an estimated 257 million people live with chronic HBV infection
(2015) while, in 2019, 38 million people were living with HIV (PLHIV). Africa, in particular sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA), is the most affected region in the world with and 70% (25.7 million) of PLHIV and ~6% of the
adult population infected with HBV. Importantly, it is estimated that chronic HBV infection affects 5-20% of
PLHIV. HBV is an asymptomatic liver disease making its early detection difficult and leading to serious
complications such as cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and early death. Knowledge of HBV status at
initiation of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) is essential for appropriate select an initial ART regimen, as
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) should be combined with lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC),
which suppress both HIV and HBV replication, and for monitoring treatment. Mali, a LMIC in West Africa
has a HIV/AIDS prevalence rate of >1% of the general population (>20 million) and specific adult population
groups (e.g., pregnant women, students, blood donors) have HBs Ag positive rates ranging from 10 to
18.8%. While HIV RNA and HBV DNA quantification assays are recommended to better guide and monitor
treatment, access to such quantification assays in SSA is very limited or not even available. In most of
Africa, HIV patients screened only on HBs Ag. Thus, patients with occult hepatitis B (OBI), despite having
HBV-DNA in serum and/or in liver, but HBs Ag negativity, will not be detected and, thus, miss an important
opportunity to initiate treatment. OBI is usually asymptomatic but its reactivation commonly occurs in
immunosuppressed individuals, such as in HIV infected persons. Measurement of viral nucleic acids plays
a critical role in determining the phase of infection, selecting treatment, and is informative about the efficacy
of antiviral therapy. This K43 application seeks to develop a multiplex, real time, quantitative PCR (RT-
qPCR) assay for simultaneous quantification of HIV RNA and HBV DNA that is specifically designed to
detect regional genetic variants, using an “open” system platform that is economically, environmentally, and
within the technical capabilities of laboratory staff in SSA. My proposed career development will be
supervised by both American and Malian mentors and focus on gaining expertise and skills in the design
and development of new multiplexed PCR assays, methods to evaluate new diagnostic tests, and in
implementation strategies for new tests, specifically as it pertains to stakeholder engagement, as well as,
strengthen my career skills in research leadership and team science."

10853094,"While the broad routes of exposure to enteric pathogens through fecal-oral contact are well-known, there are critical limitations to our understanding of pathogen-specific transmission, especially in young children in low-resource settings. A key reason for this evidence gap is the difficulty in detecting these pathogens due to the poor sensitivity of bacterial culture, which is particularly a problem for Shigella and Campylobacter. The development and application of quantitative, culture-independent molecular diagnostics for these pathogens has substantially revised our understanding of the human burden of disease and is poised to do the same for our understanding of the broader ecology of these pathogens. Shigella and Campylobacter are model organisms to interrogate transmission ecology because they lie on opposite ends of the continuum of person-to-person (Shigella) versus environmental (Campylobacter) transmission. The inclusion of both in this project provides a range of likely transmission pathways from which we can advance our understanding of enteric pathogen transmission. The objective of this proposal is therefore to understand the sources and routes of transmission of enteric pathogens in an urban low-resource setting in Dhaka, Bangladesh using culture-independent methods for detection. We will accomplish this by using a systems-dynamic modeling approach to analyze pathogen detection data generated in a household-level longitudinal study. The transmission cohort will include structured observations to quantify human contacts with the environment and broad sampling of household contacts, animal reservoirs, and the environment to identify and attribute sources for index infections. Viability PCR will be used to differentiate nucleic acid from viable organisms, which will allow us to directly measure the duration of shedding of transmissible pathogen after illness and establish quantitative thresholds for inferring viable pathogen from a wide range of samples. These data will then be used to parameterize two complementary mathematical models, a household dynamics and endemic incidence model, to interrogate the interdependence and relative importance of person-to-person and environmental transmission pathways. Pathogens will be characterized to the genome level using hybrid assembly from short- and long-read metagenomic sequencing of a subset of stool and environmental samples. This project will transform our understanding of enteric pathogen transmission by moving from a broad understanding of fecal-oral transmission routes to pathogen-specific household and environmental pathways of highest relevance. In endemic and urban settings, the relative importance of direct household contact versus environmental contamination for transmission of both Shigella and Campylobacter is unknown, and our modeling approach will contextualize where these model pathogens lie on this continuum."
10828845,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Endogenous tissue regeneration following ischemia (via enhanced neurogenesis or stem cell therapy) has been
highly sought, but the low survival rate of newly generated/newborn neurons limited the therapeutic potential of
adult neurogenesis. However, the young injured brain has a greater degree of plasticity and capacity for repair
compared to the adult. In a juvenile model of middle cerebral artery occlusion, we observe a remarkable increase
in neurogenesis in the juvenile striatum at 30d post-ischemia that is coupled with improved behavioral and
electrophysiological outcomes, which we did not observe in adults. The gap in knowledge addressed in the
current proposal involves investigating the age-associated differences in cellular signaling responsible
for enhanced neurogenesis and improved functional recovery following ischemic stroke in juveniles that
is not found in adults. The mechanisms of juvenile neurogenesis are not yet understood, but we have identified
protective early immune responses in the acute phase of juvenile stroke as a potential mechanism of
endogenous neuronal regeneration and subsequent functional recovery. This finding is contrary to reports of
proinflammatory signaling in adults during the acute phase after stroke, which is generally seen as deleterious
to neuronal survival. Determining the mechanisms of juvenile neurogenesis and functional recovery, and
identifying novel targets for post-stroke treatment is the focus of this grant. We propose to apply these results in
adults to stimulate neurogenesis and promote recovery, with the long-term goal of augmenting neurogenesis in
combination with stem cell therapy to dramatically improve neuronal survival, replacement, and post-ischemic
functional outcomes in both juveniles and adults. We plan to test the central hypothesis that the juvenile
brain differs from the adult brain, and newborn neurons survive and mature in the damaged post-
ischemic juvenile brain, enhancing neural network function and behavioral recovery through support
from stroke-induced anti-inflammatory signaling. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing the following aims:
1) neurogenesis is both required and necessary for improved neuronal repair and enhanced post-ischemic
behavioral/electrophysiological outcomes, 2) post-ischemic anti-inflammatory signaling is essential for
neurogenesis and functional recovery, and 3) endogenous neurogenesis can be enhanced in juveniles and
adults through stimulation of anti-inflammatory signaling during the acute phase of stroke. We will use transgenic
mice, viral labeling, chemogenetics, molecular assays, neurobehavioral tests, and in vivo electrophysiology to
investigate mechanisms of neurogenesis in the juvenile brain and subsequent functional recovery after stroke.
The proposed research will greatly improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying juvenile
neurogenesis and the instrumental immunomodulatory pathways supporting newborn neuron survival and
functional recovery, identifying new and innovative approaches to stroke treatment in both adults and children."

Regulatory mechanisms underlying the precise control of gene expression in normal and disease states
involve multiprotein complexes such as the highly conserved Spt-Ada-Gcn5 Acetyltransferase (SAGA)
complex. Although most of the SAGA subunits have been identified, it remains essentially unknown how their
functions are coordinated to precisely regulate gene expression. Thus, the SAGA complex represents an ideal
paradigm to explore how multiprotein complexes regulate gene expression, and the overall goal of this project
is to provide a precise mechanistic and predictive understanding for the coordination of SAGA subunit function.
SAGA subunits are organized into “activity modules”. We will focus on the well-established histone
acetyltransferase (HAT), TATA-binding protein (TBP), and histone deubiquitinase (DUB) activity modules in
SAGA, which contain the best characterized and evolutionarily conserved SAGA subunits, and are implicated
in the regulation of chromatin structure (HAT), transcription initiation (TBP) and RNA export (DUB). Our central
hypothesis is that SAGA subunits and modules function together to precisely coordinate different steps in gene
expression from chromatin regulation to RNA transcription to RNA export. We will investigate osmotic stress
induction of high osmolarity glycerol (Hog1/p38) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and gene
expression in yeast to study SAGA subunit coordination of gene expression. Importantly, we will use a newly
developed detailed and integrated experimental and computational analysis of dynamic single-molecule RNA
expression (FISH) in single cells to simultaneously quantify and model each of these steps in gene regulation.
Excitingly, our preliminary studies have revealed that the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5p increases the
dynamics of chromatin states and stochasticity in gene expression but does not regulate basal transcription,
transcription initiation, or RNA degradation. We will determine how the specific HAT module subunits regulate
chromatin structure and the kinetics of these processes (Aim 1). We will elucidate how transcription initiation is
regulated by unique TBP module subunits (Aim 2). And we will reveal how the specific DUB module subunits
differentially regulate RNA export (Aim 3). To accomplish these aims, we propose a rigorous framework of
quantitative and dynamic single-cell experiments integrated with sophisticated data analysis and predictive
single-cell modeling. This innovative approach will mechanistically dissect gene regulation by the medically
relevant and evolutionary conserved multiprotein SAGA complex, providing the first comprehensive analysis of
multiprotein gene regulatory complex coordination of gene expression within a single experiment. Furthermore,
our studies will provide a blueprint to dissect how other multiprotein complexes regulate gene expression."

The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) applies an integrative, dimensional approach anchored in circuit
neuroscience, genes, molecules, and behaviors. The RDoC framework, currently only for research, ultimately
aims at facilitating the development of psychiatric nosology (disorder-classification system) based upon
primary behavioral functions and their associated biological features that the brain has evolved to carry out.
Although the impetus behind RDoC is in the right direction, for greater efficacy of RDoC in clinical translation, a
data-driven examination is needed to validate and refine the architecture of RDoC. Further, several key
questions remain unanswered. First, as noted in the current RFA (RFA-MH-19-242), since the inception of
RDoC, a thorough data-driven validation that broadly explores, compares, and validates the constructs within
the framework has not been performed. Second, to increase clinical translation of the RDoC framework, it is
essential to assess whether constructs within a domain consistently relate to similar dimensions of
psychopathology. Thus, providing data-driven evidence for the convergent and discriminant validity of the
RDoC framework in predicting psychopathology. Lastly, and perhaps more fundamentally, it is unclear whether
carefully crafted behavioral paradigms are required to examine domain-specific features (behavioral or circuit-
level) or task-free paradigms (e.g., resting-state) can be computationally employed to extract similar domain-
specific features. The lack of task instructions in resting-state paradigms enhances compliance in clinical
populations, makes data aggregation across sites straightforward, and could provide a higher cost-benefit ratio
if a single resting-state scan can provide information that would otherwise require multiple, carefully crafted,
domain-specific neuroimaging task scans. Here, we propose to mine, systemically and computationally, three
large-scale datasets from the general population and diagnosed patient populations to answer critical
questions regarding the validity of the RDoC framework. Specifically, we aim to examine whether: (1) within-
domain constructs overlap more than do between-domain constructs; (2) within-domain constructs relate to
similar dimensions of psychopathology; and (3) task-free paradigms (e.g., resting-state) can be mined to
extract similar domain-specific information that is usually extracted using specific task-based paradigms. By
addressing these three key questions, our central goal is to provide the much-needed bottom-up examination
of the RDoC framework to pave a pathway for its refinement and translation. Our long-term goal is to develop
new computational frameworks to generate converging insights for grounding psychiatric nosology in biological
features. Altogether, without careful data-driven validation, the RDoC framework remains theoretical. Hence,
we advocate for developing a computational backbone for the RDoC framework to validate the assumptions
underlying RDoC and facilitate framework refinement for greater clinical translation."
10798261,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
Substantial pre-clinical evidence has demonstrated stress-induced tumor progression in animal models of head
and neck cancer (HNC). Clinically, patients with locoregionally advanced Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-negative
HNC are exposed to a broad range of chronic stressors. The link between cancer progression and chronic stress
may be one contributing explanation for the persistently poor oncologic outcomes of the HPV-negative HNC
population. To evaluate mechanism and develop therapeutics, animal models of chronic stress are needed.
However, existing models use either immunodeficient mice or syngeneic murine tumors, neither of which
recapitulate the human tumor microenvironment (TME). To overcome these limitations, we developed a novel
mouse model of chronic stress engineered to have a human immune system and carry human HNC xenografts.
In preliminary studies using this model, chronic stress led to increased tumor growth and metastases associated
with higher levels of circulating stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and immune alterations in the TME.
Taken together, we hypothesize that chronic stress leads to SDF-1/CXCR4 pathway upregulation which induces
an immunotolerant TME and increased tumor growth and metastasis in HNC. To test this hypothesis and
determine clinical relevance, we will investigate the mechanisms underlying stress-induced tumor growth in both
cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) humanized models of HNC. We will further
evaluate clinical relevance through a prospective observational study in patients undergoing HNC surgery.
In Aim 1, humanized CDX mice will be randomized to chronic social isolation stress or control conditions. Three
arms will be designed including (1) animals treated with a CXCR4 antagonist, (2) HNC xenografts with a CXCR4
deletion, and (3) a control arm with wild-type HNC xenografts. Tumor growth and lung metastases will be
measured. Intra-tumoral immunophenotyping and RNA sequencing will be performed. In Aim 2, we will recruit
patients with locoregionally advanced HPV-negative HNC planned for surgical resection, a population with a
poor prognosis and significant baseline exposure to chronic stressors. Patients will undergo plasma cytokine
assessment and tumor resection specimens will undergo immunophenotyping and RNA sequencing. In a subset
of these patients, autologous humanized patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models will be generated, in which the
human immune system and tumor are derived from the same patient. This is uniquely feasible for HNC surgery
with fibula reconstruction, as a segment of fibula bone is routinely discarded from which hematopoietic stem cells
can be harvested for autologous humanization. These autologous PDX models will be randomized to chronic
stress and control conditions and treated with a CXCR4 antagonist as compared with control injection.
This study will be the first to investigate the mechanism of stress-induced HNC growth in the context of the SDF-
1/CXCR4 axis and the human TME. Results from the humanized pre-clinical models and parallel prospective
clinical analyses will lay the foundation for development of precision therapeutics and rational clinical trial design."

Cardiovascular health is a global public health priority. Atherosclerosis is the most common form of coronary
heart diseases (CHD) which constitutes 17.5 million deaths worldwide annually. Globally, both outdoor and
indoor air pollutants are known as major contributors to the burdens of CHD. Despite population-based
evidence suggesting that exposure to ambient air pollutants and use of solid fuel for cooking causes increased
mortality from CHD, there is little known about the impact of air pollution on CHD morbidity and progression.
For example, the extent to which exposure to air pollution accelerates atherosclerosis, initiate plaque instability
to rupture and develop coronary events, and the mechanistic pathways underneath are largely unknown. A
better understanding of air pollutants as potential factors to the development and progression of this pervasive
disease will be valuable for public health protection strategies, especially for susceptible population such as
patients with atherosclerosis. Here we propose a longitudinal cohort study and present an overarching
hypothesis that long-term exposure to air pollutants alter coronary biological process, accelerate disease
progression, and contribute to CHD morbidity and mortality. This study builds upon a well-selected 3500
patients with atherosclerosis in Beijing retrieved from an existing cohort and will add two waves of clinic visits
in 1100 subpopulation to examine disease progression. The cohort includes extensive data of novel subclinical
markers from computed tomography angiography (CTA) reflecting plaque morphology, plaque vulnerability,
vascular stenosis, and coronary inflammation, and also collects biomarkers related to their mechanistic
pathways. We also propose to add state-of-the art air pollution exposure assessment to determine individual
level of outdoor and indoor air pollution exposure of the highest quality to address our study hypotheses.
Firstly, we will determine the impact of outdoor and indoor air pollution exposures on coronary events and total
cardiovascular mortality. Secondly, we will investigate the effects of exposure to air pollution on atherosclerosis
progression and high-risk plaque formation characterized by CTA outcomes. Thirdly, we will examine the
effects of air pollution on biological markers of inflammation pathways and explore whether these pathways
mediate any response of disease progression to air pollution exposure. Lastly, we will take the unique
opportunity of the most stringent regulation period on air pollution in Beijing and assess whether long-term
decline in ambient air pollution change the worsening of the disease progression and biological responses as
our secondary hypothesis. Apart from the main analysis, we will also explore the potential of joint effects of air
pollutant mixtures and independent effects of air pollution exposure from traffic noise on CHD. Findings from
this study will not only extend scientific knowledge on air pollution and CHD physiopathology, but will provide
information to guide public policy and inform clinical management for individuals at-risk of CHD."

Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory skin condition that affects an estimated 30% of the US population, mostly
children and adolescents. Atopic dermatitis is characterized by chronically itchy skin that can weep clear fluid
when scratched, and patients with atopic dermatitis are susceptible to bacterial, viral and fungal skin infection.
There currently are no effective treatments for the chronic itch other than temporary symptomatic relief with
topical applications (e.g. corticosteroids), and specific neurological pathways associated with the generation of
chronic itch have not been elucidated. Here, we propose that CHRONIC ITCH, as occurs in Atopic Dermatitis,
involves a novel signaling pathway that ends in release of NPPB by specific neurons in the DRG. Central to
this pathway leading to chronic itch are four molecules: a) thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP); b)
PERIOSTIN c) the (αvβ3) integrin receptor on specific neurons of the DRG called transient receptor potential
vanniloid-1 (TRPV1) neurons; and, as described above, d) natriuretic polypeptide precursor b (NPPB). The
Specific Hypothesis to be addressed is propagation of chronic itch is is initiated by a Th2 type immune response
in the skin related to atopic dermatitis. This causes localized release of the cytokine TSLP from skin keratinocytes
(and perhaps other cell types in the skin) which then, in an autocrine/paracrine fashion, binds to these and other
keratinocytes via the keratinocyte TSLP/IL7R-receptor complex. This binding activates the JAK-STAT pathway
in the keratinocytes, leading to production and release of the protein PERIOSTIN. PERIOSTIN, released by
these keratinocytes, then sets in motion the following itch circuit: Released PERIOSTIN binds to a PERIOSTIN
- binding integrin receptor αvβ3 expressed on a subset of neurons in the dorsal root ganglia, called TRPV1
neurons. As a result of PERIOSTIN binding, these TRPV1 neurons then release the neuropeptide NPPB
centrally in the spinal cord that in response sends itch signals to the brain. We will test this hypothesis through
the following specific aims: Aim 1). To determine if TSLP binding to the specific TSLP receptor complex on
keratinocytes provokes production and release of periostin through activation of the JAK-STAT pathway in these
cells; Aim 2) To determine whether PERIOSTIN binds directly to the integrin receptor αvβ3 on TRPV1 neurons
(NPPB/SST) in the DRG, and whether this generates an itch sensation in vivo; Aim 3) To demonstrate a direct
role of PERIOSTIN and neuropeptide NPPB in the generation of chronic itch in vivo. This proposed research will
identify fundamental mechanisms for neuronal responses during the generation of chronic itch secondary to
inflammatory skin disease. PERIOSTIN, integrin receptor signaling, and/or NPPB – producing neurons may
provide novel therapeutic targets to treat skin diseases manifested by chronic itch."
10878952,"Salt consumption across the world greatly exceeds minimal requirements, and excessive dietary
salt has emerged as a powerful risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. Increasing
evidence indicates that a high salt diet (HSD) is harmful to brain health independently of the
increase in blood pressure associated with HSD in salt-sensitive individuals. Unfortunately, public
health efforts to curb salt intake have been futile and dietary salt consumption continues to rise
worldwide. The long-term goal of this research program is to elucidate the mechanisms by which
HSD is injurious to cognitive health and to develop new approaches to counteract it. During the
previous funding period, we have demonstrated that HSD in mice leads to a reduction in cerebral
blood flow (CBF) and cognitive impairment through suppression of endothelial nitric oxide (NO)
production. These effects are mediated by a subclass of T-helper lymphocytes (Th17) in the small
intestine that increases circulating levels of the cytokine IL17. IL17, in turn, leads to inhibition of
endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) in cerebral endothelial cells. The resulting deficit in endothelial
NO induces cognitive impairment through neuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, a
microtubule associated protein linked to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. However,
the factors triggering the production IL17 in the gut, the cellular localization of the IL17 receptors
inducing eNOS inhibition, and the role of the CBF reduction in tau accumulation remain to be
established. This renewal application seeks to advance the mechanistic understanding of the
cognitive effects of HSD by testing the following novel hypotheses: (a) HSD triggers distinct innate
and adaptive immune responses in the gut through the microbiota, (b) the resulting increase in
circulating IL17 acts on cerebral endothelial IL17 receptors to inhibit eNOS through
downregulation of the eNOS regulatory protein striatin and, (c) the increased leukocyte adhesion
resulting from the NO deficit leads to microvascular occlusions (capillary stalling) which promote
tau accumulation in brain by reducing its microvascular clearance into the bloodstream. We will
use a well-characterized model of HSD in young and old males and female mice and state-of-the-
art approaches to examine gut-brain immune interactions, microvascular function,
hyperphosphorylated tau, and cognitive deficits. These studies advance the understanding of the
pathobiology of excessive dietary salt at the cellular and molecular levels and may lead to new
approaches to mitigate its harmful effects on brain health that lead to cognitive impairment."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that downregulate the
expression of their gene targets. Both computational and experimental studies have shown that
thousands of human protein-coding genes are regulated by miRNAs, and miRNAs are master
regulators of many important biological processes. Changes in miRNA expression can have
profound biological impacts, leading to a variety of human diseases. Due to their critical roles in
gene expression regulation, functional characterization of miRNAs has become one of the most
active research fields in biology in recent years.
 Despite rapid progress in miRNA research, one major obstacle in this field is the lack of
robust computational and experimental methods for functional miRNA analysis. Funded by this
NIGMS R01 grant over the past ten years, we have made significant progress and published
many methods on miRNA and gene expression studies. The methods we established have
been widely adopted by the scientific community. In particular, we have developed a miRNA
target prediction tool, miRDB, which has quickly become a major bioinformatics resource and
has been cited by thousands of publications. Moreover, we have developed innovative
experimental methods to manipulate the expression levels of miRNAs. Built on our recent
progress, we propose to perform combined computational and experimental analyses to
continue to develop cutting-edge technologies for miRNA studies. Our work is expected to exert
a significant impact in the miRNA field by providing valuable resources for functional miRNA
analysis."

As a prominent leader in the nationwide shift towards value-based payment, Medicare has implemented large
fee-for-service population- and episode-based alternative payment models (APMs) that hold organizations
financially accountable for the quality and costs of care. However, these APMs are not designed to protect
access or outcomes for racial/ethnic minorities and individuals with low socioeconomic status. These
vulnerable groups already face significant surgical disparities compared to other individuals. These disparities
could worsen further under both APM types if participating providers engage in patient selection that reduces
vulnerable patients’ access to surgical procedures or changes their care after participating. Because
policymakers must make critical decisions about how to use different APMs to catalyze nationwide reform,
insight about how population- and episode-based APMs affect surgical disparities for vulnerable patients can
help policymakers determine how to best design, refine, implement policy adjustments, and scale up different
models to safeguard the care of vulnerable patients. This study examines how prominent Medicare fee-for-
service population- and episode-based APMs that are highly relevant to surgical care affect disparities in
surgical access and outcomes for vulnerable patients, across insurance coverage type, and whether effects
vary by providers’ financial attributes related to APM incentives. We hypothesize that APM participation will be
associated with widened disparities in surgical access and outcomes (quality, utilization, and cost) for
vulnerable vs. non-vulnerable patients after providers begin participating in APMs. We also hypothesize that
the impact on surgical disparities will vary by providers’ financial attributes – experience with financial risk and
payer mix – related to APM incentives."

 Timely, high-quality prenatal care is associated with improved child and maternal health outcomes, and
comprehensive health insurance coverage during pregnancy facilitates access to prenatal care. The Affordable
Care Act (ACA) included prenatal and maternity care as one of the ten essential health benefits that must be
covered in Marketplace plans (i.e., commercial insurance plans for individuals). ACA Marketplaces are an
important source of health insurance for pregnant people who are not eligible for Medicaid or employer-
sponsored insurance. However, current Marketplace enrollment policies make it challenging to enroll in
a Marketplace plan early in pregnancy, which may have adverse consequences for access to prenatal
care and child and maternal health outcomes.
 All Marketplace plans have an annual open enrollment period (OEP) from approximately November to
January. An individual can enroll in a Marketplace plan outside of the annual OEP only through a special
enrollment period (SEP), which is a limited time window after a qualifying life event (e.g., loss of insurance
coverage, or household change [including childbirth]). The ACA did not include pregnancy as a qualifying
event for SEP Marketplace coverage. Therefore, people who become pregnant outside of the OEP must
delay Marketplace enrollment until they have an eligible SEP-qualifying event, the next annual OEP, or give
birth. In recent years, six U.S. states have enacted policy to include pregnancy as a Marketplace SEP-
qualifying event, meaning that people in these states can enroll in a Marketplace plan when they become
pregnant. We hypothesize that this policy facilitates Marketplace enrollment earlier in pregnancy, increases the
percent of pregnant people on the Marketplace who receive timely, high-quality prenatal care, and improves
maternal and infant health outcomes for Marketplace enrollees.
 Our study will exploit a natural experiment created by state-level variation in Marketplace SEP eligibility
rules to estimate the impact of a policy to include pregnancy as a SEP-qualifying event. Specifically, we will
first (Aim 1) describe the role of the Marketplace in providing health insurance coverage and access to
prenatal care for pregnant people (Aim 1). We will then use a robust quasi-experimental design to evaluate the
impact of including pregnancy as an SEP-qualifying event on (Aim 2) timely prenatal care and (Aim 3) infant
and maternal health outcomes for pregnant people who enroll in Marketplace. We will use all-payer claims data
from New York (intervention state) and Massachusetts (control state) from 2014-2019, which provide many
advantages over data used in prior research of pregnant people on the Marketplace. The findings from our
study will provide critical and timely information for state-level and federal-level policy-makers to ensure that
Marketplace coverage is (i) accessible for pregnant people without other insurance coverage options, and (ii)
effective in improving prenatal care and, ultimately, child and maternal health outcomes."

Ontologies represent a domain of knowledge in a form that can be used by both computers and
people. Biomedical ontologies provide standardized representations of knowledge that underlie modern
biomedical research and serve as knowledge bases for enabling intelligent software applications. The
Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) is an ontology of human anatomy and has a rich history as one of
the first biomedical ontologies. After 20 years of development, two issues that affect the ability of the
FMA to continue to serve as a source for standardized, computable knowledge of human anatomy have
become apparent: First, variation in modeling schemes and inter-author variation have introduced
inconsistencies, such that similar structures within the body are represented in slightly different ways.
Second, ontologies rely on textual and logical representations, yet visual representations are often more
effective for communicating about anatomy. These issues highlight the need for a next-generation
resource for human anatomy that is optimized for use by both computers and people.
 In this project, we will undertake synergistic development of an ontology of human anatomy and
standardized visual representations of human anatomy. Aim 1: To develop an ontology of human
anatomy suitable for computational reasoning that will serve as a knowledgebase for the next generation
of medical information systems, we will create the Foundational Model of Human Anatomy (FMHA) as a
derivative of the FMA. Aim 2: To provide standardized visual representations of human anatomy for use
in information systems, we will develop libraries of composable graphics depicting canonical anatomy
that will be augmented with computer-readable semantics. Aim 3: To demonstrate use of the FMHA and
standardized graphics to address real-world needs in research, education, and clinical contexts, we will
expand our graphic libraries beyond depictions of canonical anatomy and develop two web applications.
Aim 4: To demonstrate how developers can leverage the FMHA and graphics in their own web
applications, we will develop a web application for graphically-driven exploration of the Disease
Ontology.
 By developing the FMHA and anatomical graphics libraries as highly-curated resources, they will
serve as trustworthy knowledge sources for biomedical applications in data science. By integrating text-
based and visual representations of anatomy, we will help to ensure that researchers accurately
annotate the anatomical content of datasets and models using FMHA classes, thereby helping to
preserve the integrity of integrated datasets and models.

This study investigates how the body maintains a memory of ‘Self’. When facing foreign organisms and cancer,
this self-knowledge is thought to be critical, serving to educate the immune system to limit autoimmunity and
conversely license reactivity to things that are ‘Foreign’. The core of the study focuses on a newly-discovered
organelle, found within macrophages and some dendritic cells which we call the Self-Associated Storage
Organelle or SASO for short. We believe that the SASO is critical to ‘hold’ our self-identity and subsequently
educate the rest of our immune system and it appears to come from a stealthy and subtle form of ‘cell
nibbling’.Our proposal is unique in applying cutting technologies—lattice-light sheet imaging, vesicle flow, Mass-
spectrometry and Electron Microscopy—together with conventional cellular immunoassay methods and genetic
screens, to understand how this newly described component of the immune system works as well as how we
can harness it to improve health. The resultant discoveries will be formative for designing new ways to boost
anti-tumor immunity, to minimize autoimmunity and to broadly regulate which components of our bodies are seen
as ‘Self’."
10825556,"In 2020, rectal cancer caused over 339,000 deaths globally, and 732,000 new cases were reported. Historically,
Stage II and III tumors, also known as locally advanced rectal cancers (LARC), have been treated with surgical
resection, radiation, and chemotherapy. However, advances in neoadjuvant (preoperative) treatment now enable
up to 35% of patients to achieve complete tumor death, or complete response, with radiation and chemotherapy
alone. In these individuals, surgical resection has shown no benefit and carries the significant risks of major
complications, prolonged recovery, and reduced quality of life. Unfortunately, standard clinical testing and
radiographic and endoscopic imaging modalities poorly differentiate post-treatment scars from the residual
tumor. Confounded by post-treatment fibrotic reaction and edema, the poor performance of current technology
makes it extremely difficult to identify complete responders before surgery. Due to this technological gap,
surgical resection remains the standard of care (SOC) for all patients outside of specialized tertiary care centers.
With improved imaging modalities, widespread adoption of nonoperative management would reduce treatment
morbidity for thousands of rectal cancer patients annually. One promising modality, photoacoustic imaging, uses
hemoglobin as an endogenous contrast agent to map tissue vascular networks. For clinical use, we have
developed and tested a new co-registered acoustic resolution photoacoustic microscopy and ultrasound (AR-
PAM/US) endoscopy prototype system, together with a deep learning neural network classifier. Initial testing
demonstrated a unique marker of complete tumor response – specifically, recovery of normal mucosal vascular
architecture within the treated tumor bed. We hypothesize that our co-registered AR-PAM/US system and the
neural net classifiers can assist surgeons to examine the residual tumor microvessel network and assess rectal
cancer patients’ pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant treatment. We also hypothesize that serial AR-
PAM/US studies will perform significantly better than SOC methods in predicting complete response at treatment
conclusion and during post-treatment surveillance.
We propose to advance and optimize our prototype AR-PAM/US system, probe, and software and to optimize
AR-PAM neural network classifiers to accurately differentiate complete responders from those with residual
cancer. We will prospectively assess the ability of co-registered AR-PAM/US technology to improve SOC
imaging in a cohort of LARC patients on post-treatment risk management and surgery recommendation. We will
also monitor a group of LARC patients to determine if the co-registered AR-PAM/US technology can assess
changes in tumor vascular and blood oxygen saturation and identify rectal cancer response, both during the
course of treatment as well as in post-treatment surveillance. If successful, this technology will directly reduce
the number of unnecessary surgeries for rectal cancer and improve quality of life."
10931339,"This proposal discusses the development and evaluation of a collaborative Assistive Robotic Manipulator
(ARM) which allows the Veteran to preference control authority (user moving the arm versus robot software
moving the arm) at any point in a multi-action task: flexible control authority (FlexCA). Veterans with
tetraplegia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS) can readily access electric power
wheelchairs (EPWs) for their mobility needs but are still limited in performing manipulation tasks. Current
options for manipulation assistance include low tech specialized manipulation tools, modifications of the
environment, caregiver support, and robotic arms. ARMs for EPW users are capable of a variety of functions
but are unintuitive to control. Manually driving the control input for an ARM requires reasoning about many
different modes for moving the arm in three directions, rotating the arm’s wrist in three directions, and opening
and closing the gripper. The addition of more intelligent robot software assistance can ease control burdens
but should also adapt to a user’s changing abilities, preferences, and contexts. Previous work pre-assigns
control authority, which creates a rigid order of actions that causes unexpected behavior if the user decides to
interrupt the system. This career development award (CDA-1) addresses an unforeseen challenge, the ability
to allow the user to change their control authority preference by creating a seamless transition between manual
control and robot autonomous operation both within and between different functional task actions. This is
achieved through a development aim and an evaluation aim. The first aim is to develop the FlexCA assistive
dialogue control system for ARMs that tracks the user state within a kitchen task allowing the Veteran to initiate
control authority. The first goal of this aim is to infer the current state within a multi-action task regardless of
how the robot is controlled. This is formulated as a sequential stochastic state model that leverages
environment observations and user input to successfully monitor and estimate the state allowing the robotic
software to seamlessly pick up wherever the user leaves off. Input and feedback from the system is initiated
through the development of a voice-activated user interface. The system is evaluated in two phases. The first
phase involves a representative user that actively participates in the iterative design process, and a group of
benchmark users. The second phase evaluates the FlexCA system among Veterans with limited arm function
who use EPWs. Veterans are recruited to provide objective performance measures and subjective
assessments of usability and task workload. This work empowers Veterans with upper limb impairment to
perform realistic functional tasks with an ARM. By achieving our aims, algorithmic developments can be
generalized towards other assistive devices, and inform future models for more appropriately matching
assistive systems that adapt to the user positively impacting their quality of life.
 This CDA-1 provides training experience in assistive technology, clinical methodology, and human
robot interaction that bridges the candidate’s previous experience in robotics and software industry with the
development of assistive technology to increase Veteran independence. Immediate goals include constructing
user-centric driven technology specific to rehabilitation robotics and assistive devices and understanding the
methodology of human subject study design. Long-term career goals include future work as a principal
investigator on topics that merge probabilistic techniques, such as predictive modeling and stochastic decision
making, for more context-aware and user-centric assistive technology platforms that include smart home
environments, robotic wheelchairs, and robotic assistive arms."
10798283,"Project Summary. Septal-hypothalamic neuronal activity centrally mediates aggressive behavior, while the
monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin play strong and mostly opposing modulatory roles.
However, related circuit mechanisms and ontogeny are largely unknown. Making progress towards circuit
mechanism, we found in mice that dopamine input from the ventral tegmental area to the lateral septum is
sufficient for promoting aggression and necessary for establishing baseline aggression. Within the lateral
septum, dopamine acts on D2 receptors to inhibit GABA neurons that project to the hypothalamus. These
findings effectively link the clinically pertinent hyper-dopamine model of aggression with the classic septal-
hypothalamic aggression axis. Making progress towards ontogeny, we identified a sensitive developmental
window during adolescence where dopamine transporter blockade permanently increases adult aggression,
impulsivity, and behavioral stimulant response, and in parallel leads to a hyperactive dopamine system.
Conversely, periadolescent serotonin transporter blockade reduces aggression and behavioral stimulant
response in adulthood, and in parallel leads to a hypoactive dopamine system. Here we will continue this line of
research and study the overarching hypothesis that developmental DA and 5-HT signaling tunes DA input
into the LS and NAc to impact aggression-related behaviors in adulthood. In Aim 1, we investigate the
causal role of dopamine input into the nucleus accumbens in aggression-related behavior. Aggression is
behaviorally classified into reactive aggression which occurs impulsively in response to perceived external threat
and proactive aggression that is premeditated and directly motivated by a drive for appetitive reward. We
hypothesize that nucleus accumbens input contributes to the appetitive value in proactive aggression. In Aim 2,
we test the hypothesis that D2 receptors of the lateral septum contribute to sexual dimorphic differences in
aggressive behavior. We already found D2 receptors mediate dopamine-promoted aggression in male mice as
well as sexual dimorphism for D2 receptor expression. Furthermore, dopamine input into the lateral septum is
not sufficient to trigger aggression in females. In Aim 3, we investigate the causal role of serotonin input into the
lateral septum and nucleus accumbens in aggression-related behavior. Finally, in Aim 4, we investigate if
permanently altered DAergic input into the LS and NAc drives the aggression phenotypes after dopamine and
serotonin transporter blockade during development, by monitoring pathway-specific dopaminergic activity during
behavior, paired with optogenetic rescue experiments. By mapping circuits to behavior in the context of sensitive
developmental period interference, we will advance our understanding of normal as well as disrupted brain

10872254,"Abstract: For women who use drugs (WWUD) in the US, the months they are pregnant and postpartum are
among the most hazardous of their lives: the US has the highest maternal mortality rate of all industrialized na-
tions, and up to 26% of maternal deaths in multiple states are attributed to drug use. Disparities are complex.
Though all-cause maternal mortality rates are higher for Black women, rates of drug-related maternal mortal-
ity are far higher among White women. Rural/urban inequities are stark and widening. Public health scientists
have largely neglected this crisis. Since 2010, just 1.6% of articles in major addiction journals have addressed
pregnancy or the postpartum period; a parallel silence exists in maternal health research. The proposed 4-
year longitudinal qualitative study is thus designed to help lay the foundations for a new arena of mul-
tilevel epidemiologic research and interventions to help Black, White, urban, and rural WWUD survive
while pregnant and postpartum. Four pillars of the Intersectional Risk Environment Model (IREM) guide this
novel inquiry: harm reduction, intersectional equity, intersectional risk environments, and resistance.
Harm reduction principles invite us to recognize that pregnant/postpartum WWUD have vital insights into the
drug and sexual/reproductive (SR) harms that drugs can create for them, and may have crafted effective prac-
tices to prevent these harms (e.g., altering drug use frequency). Intersectional equity insists that pregnant/
postpartum WWUD’s drug and SR health concerns and practices may vary along intersecting dimensions of
their social position (e.g., race and rurality/urbanicity). IREM suggests that features of WWUD’s social, eco-
nomic, physical, policy, and healthcare/criminal legal intervention risk environments create these variations,
and that these environments are racialized and structurally urbanized–i.e., resources have been dispropor-
tionately allocated to urban and/or majority White areas, and hazards to rural and/or majority Black areas.
IREM posits that hazards can be resisted via individual and collective action. Guided by IREM and Advisory
Boards of WWUD, we will use Constructivist Grounded Theory and Qualitative Longitudinal Research
methods to “walk alongside” a cohort of Black, White, urban, and rural WWUD living in 4 racialized and struc-
turally urbanized regions of Georgia while they are pregnant and postpartum, gathering 5 waves of data, to:
Aim 1. Explore pregnant WWUDs’ (a) drug- and SR-related health concerns and practices, and how they vary
across pregnancy and by race, rurality/urbanicity, and socioeconomic status (SES); and (b) perceptions of their
racialized and structurally urbanized risk environments, how they evolve during pregnancy, and how these
evolving environments shape WWUD’s concerns and practices. Aim 2. Analyze postpartum WWUD’s (a)
drug- and SR-related concerns and practices, and how they vary in the postpartum months by race, rurality/ur-
banicity, and SES; and (b) perceptions of their racialized and structurally urbanized risk environments, how
they evolve postpartum, and how these evolving environments shape WWUD’s concerns and practices."

The gradual loss of hearing is a common manifestation of aging, ultimately affecting communication and
leading to social exclusion and cognitive decline in the elderly population. Our long-term research goal is to
understand the elusive molecular pathways that are responsible for age-related hearing loss (ARHL) in
humans, to promote our understanding of, delay or prevent this condition. Our approach will be to mine and
dissect the list of 51 variants associated with human ARHL identified previously in two European populations,
which represent the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted to date. Our central hypothesis
is that the ARHL variants and associated genes can be grouped into functional networks. Here, we
propose to identify one of these functional networks starting from one variant that affects a gene for
which we have expertise, termed LOXHD1. LOXHD1 is expressed in hair cells, which are sensory cells of
the inner ear that are capable of transforming the force induced by sound into an electric current, a process
that is called mechanotransduction. We found that LOXHD1 is required for the mechanotransduction process
itself in mature hair cells. Because of the strong evolutionary conservation of the genes and mechanisms
involved in hearing among mammals, we hypothesize that the ARHL missense variant LOXHD1R1090Q can
be modeled in mice, to facilitate our understanding of the pathogenicity of its human orthologue.
In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the auditory phenotype of the aging mouse mutant Loxhd1R1064Q, which
mimics the human ARHL variant, and determine the localization of the LOXHD1 protein together with the
mechanotransduction channel in cochlear hair cells. By completing this aim, we expect to define the manner in
which LOXHD1R1090Q increases the susceptibility to ARHL in humans.
In Specific Aim 2, we will determine whether the ARHL LOXHD1 variant increases the susceptibility of the
animals to environmental insults, such as noise, and whether it accelerates the aging process in the ear. We
will determine the transcriptional program of hair cells during noise damage recovery in the presence of the
wild-type form or the ARHL variant.
In Specific Aim 3, we will use biochemistry to validate direct LOXHD1 putative interactors that also
correspond to ARHL genes. We will test if their localization is affected by LOXHD1 deficiency using antibodies
and tagged knock-in mice.
Overall, we expect to connect the first subset of human ARHL genes in a functional network. Our future work
will aim to define other subsets of genes to obtain the full picture of ARHL in European populations, and then
extend this approach to other populations."

Our team proposes to lead the SSPsyGene consortium into the Data Biosphere. We will do this by adapting
data biosphere technology and management techniques we have already deployed for other NIH institutes,
NIH Common Fund, the NIH Office of the Director, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), and the California
Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), making SSPsyGene interoperable across multiple disease areas.
We also bring our expertise with neurological data through our involvement with BICCN, Psychiatric Cell Map
Initiative, CZI’s Pediatric Brain Map, NHGRI's Center for Live Cell Genomics/Biotechnology, and our close
relationship with PsychENCODE and the Allen Brain Institute. For SSPsyGene, we have 4 major tasks: (1) We
will assemble all the information necessary to empower the consortium to choose between 100 and 250 genes
to experimentally characterize (Aim 2). We have identified more than 20 different types of information to be
integrated for this purpose, many of which are already in the UCSC Genome Browser. We will apply multiple
ranking algorithms to this integrated information source to guide the SSPsyGene Consortium’s decision
process. (2) We will work to establish an ontology structure that is sufficiently expressive yet fully maintainable,
supporting FAIR data use by both researchers and machines (Aim 3). Our previous work with the UCSC
Genome Browser and our close relationships with ontology organizations will help us to bridge the gaps
between molecular, cellular, tissue/organoid, and model organism measurements, and to extend these
resources when needed. Inspired by our experience with the clinical ontologies in OMOP and FHIR, we
propose a novel service to allow researchers to query phenotype-phenotype associations in large clinical
cohorts, such as All of Us and HEDIS, the database of records from Medicare and Medicaid. (3) We will create
a state-of-the-art SSPsyGene Data Biosphere fully compatible with those we created for other NIH institutes
(Aim 4). Our emphasis will be on standardization of the data submission process with extensive quality
monitoring to ensure timely and effective data release. We will leverage our deep involvement with the Global
Alliance for Genomics and Health to ensure all data and metadata will meet FAIR standards. We have
experience with the complex data types that will be generated by the SSPsyGene consortium, including
-omics, imaging, electrophysiology and other data types. (4) We have served as trusted third party organizers
to many NIH consortia, developing a reputation for fairness and impartiality in data sharing and publication,
and expertise in coordinating, generating consensus, publishing results, and creating a resource with maximal
impact (Aim 5). Based on our strengths in biomedical data, metadata and ontologies, FAIR platforms, and
consortium leadership, we are confident that we will achieve all the goals of the SSPsyGene Consortium."

Prostate cancer (PC) affects 1 in 9 men and causes nearly 30,000 yearly deaths in the United States.
Understanding the PC tumor microenvironment (TME) is essential for optimizing cancer prevention and care.
Unlike highly mutable tumor cells, non-cancerous stromal cells in the TME, consisting primarily of cancer
associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are a genetically stable and attractive therapeutic target in PC, with reduced risk
of acquired resistance from genetic changes. Our long-term goals are to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
governing stromal support of PC growth and progression, and identify potential druggable therapeutic targets
in the stromal compartment to disrupt tumor-stromal interactions. We recently found that monoamine oxidase B
(MAOB), a mitochondrial oxidative enzyme responsible for degrading monoamine neurotransmitters and
dietary amines, is highly induced in PC stromal cells compared to normal prostate stromal cells in patient
samples, PTEN-knockout (KO) transgenic mice and primary cultures of patient-derived CAFs. Stromal MAOB
expression further increases during disease progression toward castration resistance and neuroendocrine
differentiation, compared to hormone-naïve disease. Our epidemiological studies revealed that men taking
MAOB inhibitors for neurological disorders such as depression tend to have a lower incidence of PC.
Functional studies showed that MAOB ablation in prostate stromal cells profoundly suppressed co-cultured PC
cell proliferation/invasion and co-inoculated xenograft/allograft prostate tumor growth in mice. Mechanistically,
gene profiling, bioinformatics and phenotypic analyses indicate that stromal MAOB heightens cellular reactive
oxygen species (ROS) levels and chemotaxis/chemokine secretion, particularly CXCL13. Based on these new
findings, we hypothesize that the elevated expression of MAOB in PC stromal cells promotes adjacent
epithelial PC development and progression, and that targeting MAOB and its downstream effectors in stromal
cells is an effective strategy to treat PC. In Aim 1, we will determine the functional role of MAOB in stromal
activation and its contribution to tumor growth and progression in tissue recombinant xenograft
immunocompromised mice and MAOB-KO immunocompetent mice. In Aim 2, we will investigate the molecular
mechanism by which MAOB mediates tumor-stromal communication in PC, specifically dissecting how Twist1
cooperates with TGFβ1/Smad3/4 by ROS to activate CXCL13 and how the CXCL13/CXCR5 paracrine axis
impacts PC cell behaviors and associated novel signaling pathways in the context of MAOB. We will also
establish the relevance of our mechanistic findings in a large collection of human PC samples and assess
correlations with disease status. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the efficacy of MAOB inhibitors for treating PC,
including castration-resistant PC, in xenograft and syngeneic mouse prostate tumor models. These studies
have tremendous biological, pathological and clinical implications for the future application of clinical MAOB
inhibitors and development of TME-targeted therapies to complement existing tumor cell-centric PC therapies."

Nucleotide-binding domain (NBD)-like and leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing proteins (NLRs)
perform diverse functions in cellular biology, mediating a broad set of fundamental biological
pathways from immune signaling to embryonic development. In immunity, several NLRs form
supramolecular protein signaling complexes called inflammasomes. Inflammasomes activate
caspase-1, an inflammatory protease that processes the cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and the
pore-forming protein gasdermin D to potentiate pyroptotic cell death. One such inflammasome-
forming protein, NLRP1, is directly activated in response to intracellular pathogens and the
inhibition of DPP9, an endogenous peptidase, serving as both a pattern recognition receptor
and a signaling complex. While most NLRs share a common domain architecture, the
multifunctionality and regulation of NLRP1 requires additional structural components.
 In addition to the characteristic NBD and LRR domains, human NLRP1 contains an N-
terminal pyrin domain (PYD) and a rare function-to-find domain (FIIND) followed by a caspase
activation and recruitment domain (CARD) on its C-terminus. The only other protein with a
FIIND is CARD8, which has also been shown to form inflammasomes, leading to cytokine
secretion and cell death. Mechanistically, the NLRP1 and CARD8 FIIND domains constitutively
catalyze autoproteolytic cleavage, leading to the formation of two noncovalently associated
peptides: an autoinhibitory N-terminal fragment and an inflammatory C-terminal fragment.
Additionally, Dipeptidyl peptidase 8 or 9 (DPP8/9) binds and inhibits NLRP1 and CARD8, and
small molecule inhibitors of DPP8/9 induces NLRP1 and CARD8 activation through some poorly
understood pathway. In this application, we propose to elucidate the activation and regulation of
NLRP1 and CARD8 using a structure-guided approach. We will determine structures of NLRP1
or CARD8 in complex with DPP8 or DPP9, both WT and mutants. We will analyze the structures
and perform additional biochemical and cellular biological experiments to test our hypotheses.
In one central aim, we propose that NLRP1 and CARD8 are stress sensors for endogenous
cellular dysregulation and play important roles in unwanted inflammation and diseases."

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US, despite decades of
advancements in treatment, including stent coatings and anti-platelet therapies. The improvements in stent
material technology progressed from bare metal stainless steel, cobalt-chromium, and nitinol (high
thrombogenicity and high restenosis) to drug eluting polymer coated metals (lowered restenosis, but
thrombogenic) to biodegradable polymers (potential to decrease restenosis, but still thrombogenic). Despite
these incremental advances, thrombosis and in-stent restenosis all remain significant clinical obstacles, limiting
the life-saving potential of stent applications in cardiac and peripheral arteries and requiring life-long prescription
of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies for patients. Recently, biodegradable metals have garnered interest
for stent applications to reduce thrombosis and restenosis. Biodegradable metal vascular stents must have
sufficient mechanical strength to maintain an open lumen for at least 6 months, must be non-thrombogenic,
prevent restenosis, and degrade between 6 months and 2 years, while maintaining cytocompatibility.
Biodegradable metal stents bioresorb through corrosion by which the metal is converted to a more stable form,
such as its oxide, hydroxide or sulphide state. Initial studies of biodegradable metals like iron (Fe), magnesium
(Mg), and zinc (Zn) have shown promise in terms of mechanical properties and degradation rates. Importantly,
the degradation products of these metals are biocompatible ions which contribute to cell functions. A single metal
does not meet the requirements of a biodegradable metallic stent, yet metallic alloys and optimization of materials
processing techniques can satisfy the stringent requirements. We have established the ability to design,
manufacture, and test alloys with up to 5 metal alloying elements based on zinc and magnesium. Through our
proposed work, the impact of critical processing steps (e.g., hot extrusion, cold drawing) on material properties,
particularly microstructure, biodegradation rate, and biodegradation uniformity, will be determined. We will
quantify the biological responses of pure and alloyed biodegradable metals to determine their performance in
the vascular system, particularly emphasizing thrombosis, restenosis, and inflammatory responses to the alloyed
metals and their degraded ions. In the present proposal, our goal is to develop biodegradable metal alloys that
meet the strict mechanical and biologic requirements of vascular stents. The overall objective of this project is to
identify alloying elements and material processing requirements for biodegradable metal materials that can
suppress local thrombo-inflammatory responses by (1) developing and characterizing the mechanical, material,
and surface properties of biodegradable metal alloys and (2) establishing the biocompatibility of biodegradable
metals for vascular stent applications. Successful completion of this R01 will result in identification of
biodegradable metal alloys that meet the mechanical and biological requirements of vascular stents, and set the
stage for long-term pre-clinical testing."

Mutations in GDAP1 are associated with the peripheral neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Charcot-Ma-
rie-Tooth is one of most common inherited neurological disorders, estimated to affect 126,000 people in the
United States alone. GDAP1 knockdown, overexpression, and as well as multiple models of CMT show changes
consistent with dysregulation of the cellular response to oxidative stress. These include changes in NRF2-driven
transcriptional activity, evidence of glutathione depletion, redox disbalance, and mitochondrial depolarization. At
the same time key aspects of the mitochondrial network’s response to oxidative stress are very similar to key
aspects of CMT phenotypes: fragmentation, fusion deficits and change in position inside the cell. Finally, GDAP1
is a member of the Glutathione S-transferase (GST) superfamily which protect the cell against peroxidated lipids
and xenobiotics, toxic molecules that accumulate under conditions of oxidative stress. The mechanism underly-
ing GDAP1’s role in oxidative stress response is unknown. We have recently discovered that GDAP1 can bind
4-hydroxynoneal (4HNE), a toxic lipid that is formed from the breakdown of peroxidated lipids primarily in the
mitochondria. This proposal will address two main questions: can GDAP1 utilize 4HNE as a substrate, in a
manner similar to canonical GST enzymes, or does it have a non-enzymatic role in the oxidative stress re-
sponse? Secondly, are there conformational changes associated with or a consequence of 4HNE binding? We
will address these questions by 1) biochemically measuring enzymatic parameters associated with 4HNE medi-
ated GST activity; 2) biochemically defining the impact of important residues within the putative active site pocket
on 4HNE binding affinity and GST enzymatic activity; 3) determining the structure of the GDAP1-4HNE complex
using x-ray crystallography. These data will define the molecular mechanism by which GDAP1 recognizes 4HNE
to facilitate binding and reveal and conformational changes in protein that are associated with 4HNE binding. If
GDAP1 is an enzyme it will reveal how it facilitates catalysis of 4HNE with glutathione. If GDAP1 is playing a
non-enzymatic role, conformational changes resulting from 4HNE will play a key role in GDAP1 function and will
be revealed in this structure. Overall, these studies will be critical in shaping future biochemical and cell-based
investigations centered on GDAP1 function. Further, the structure will provide the foundation needed to compu-
tationally predict small molecule binding partners, critical tools for modulating GDAP1 function that will allow
deeper interrogation of CMT disease models and a first step towards therapeutic intervention."

Treatment resistant depression (TRD) is present in about 2.5 percent of the population and is associated with
considerable personal suffering and societal costs. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe
and effective treatment for TRD that is increasingly being used in clinical practice across the world. However,
while there is convincing evidence for the effectiveness of rTMS treatment, the overall remission rate achieved
in patients is typically considerably less than 50%. Coupled with the fact that a course of rTMS takes considerable
time to administer (up to 6 weeks), this limited efficacy substantially impacts clinical utility. Intermittent theta burst
stimulation (iTBS) is a new form of TMS that involves the patterned application of stimulation pulses in both the
theta and gamma frequencies. iTBS has recently been shown to be non-inferior to standard rTMS but can be
applied in a dramatically shorter time, typically three minutes per day compared to 20-40 minutes. However, the
use of iTBS has not been shown to enhance overall treatment efficacy compared to rTMS. Several methods are
under investigation to try to improve the efficacy of iTBS treatment, in part through the individualization of
treatment parameters. In this study, individualization of iTBS will include frequency and location optimization.
Frequency individualization involves stimulating at each patient’s endogenous brain rhythms derived from theta-
gamma coupling during a working memory task. Our findings suggest that such frequency individualization of
iTBS produces greater effects on neuroplasticity, cognitive function, and mood enhancement in healthy subjects.
Next, we have developed methods to individualize coil placement using electric field (E-field) modelling to limit
anatomic variability and maximize dosing for each patient. We will aim to individually target the TMS e-field to a
specific cortical region corresponding to Talairach coordinate (–45, 45, 35) in the left dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex (DLPFC). We also previously reported that targeting this region with rTMS produces superior efficacy
compared to conventional targeting. We now propose to undertake a 2-phase program to determine if
individualized iTBS based on frequency and E-field modelling will enhance its efficacy in patients with TRD. In
the R61 phase of this application, we will test if this novel approach produces target engagement by randomizing
75 patients with TRD to a course of frequency and location individualized iTBS, location individualized iTBS only,
or standard iTBS stimulation. We aim to establish whether individualized frequency/location iTBS produces a
greater change in theta connectivity as a demonstration of its capacity to alter activity in relevant frontal–parietal
circuitry. If this is established, we will have achieved our go-criterion and will request to proceed with the three-
year R33 phase. During this phase, we will conduct a larger scale randomized controlled trial comparing
individualized frequency/location iTBS to standard iTBS in 144 patients with TRD and compare the effects on
both target engagement (fronto-parietal theta connectivity) and clinical outcomes (depression severity). The
overall goal of this research is to develop a more effective form of iTBS treatment for patients with TRD."

 Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) disease is a common cause of premature death in adult
Americans. To date, no medical (e.g., non-surgical) therapies have proven effective at limiting AAA disease
progression, or reducing the risk of AAA rupture or aneurysm-related sudden death.
 The recognition that diabetic individuals are less likely to develop AAAs and when present in diabetics,
AAAs enlarge less rapidly and rupture less frequently, introduces new possibilities for medical AAA disease
management. Recent retrospective studies suggest that metformin, the world’s most commonly prescribed oral
hypoglycemic agent, may be associated with reduced rates of AAA enlargement. To date, however, the ability
of metformin to suppress AAA disease has not been evaluated in a scientifically rigorous, prospective fashion.
 Building off existing observational evidence and novel preliminary data, generated to support this proposal,
it is our fundamental hypothesis that metformin therapy will safely suppress AAA disease progression in non-
diabetic patients. To test this hypothesis, two Specific Aims are proposed. The First Aim will evaluate the
tolerability and safety of metformin in nondiabetic patients with AAA disease. Tolerance will be assessed by the
serial administration of quality of life surveys and tracking participant compliance and retention. Safety will be
assessed by semi-annual examinations, review of the source medical record, supplementary hematologic and
metabolic panel surveys as needed. The Second Aim will test the ability of metformin XR (extended release)
to reduce the average annual rate of enlargement of existing small to intermediate size AAAs by ≥ 30%
compared to placebo. For this Aim, 480 participants will be randomized 1:1 to metformin or placebo. The
primary endpoint will be the increase in mean maximal orthogonal AAA diameter through 24 months, as
determined by computed tomographic aortography (CTA). Successful completion of these Aims will advance
the understanding of AAA disease as well as the translational utility of metformin therapy to treat
cardiovascular diseases in nondiabetic patients.
 These Aims specifically address the NIH Strategic Vision Goals of 1) understanding human biology, 2)
reducing human disease, and 3) advancing translational research, as well as Objectives of 1) understanding
normal biologic function and resilience, 2) investigating newly discovered pathobiological mechanisms, and 3)
developing and optimizing novel therapeutic strategies to prevent, treat and cure HLBS diseases."

Efforts to promote recovery of function after human spinal cord injury (SCI) will likely require interventions
targeting the corticospinal motor system, the most important pathway for voluntary motor control in
humans. In a series of studies over the past 4 years we have found that corticospinal tract (CST) axons
regenerate into spinal cord neural stem cell (NSC) grafts placed into sites of SCI in mice, rats and
monkeys. These regenerating CST axons form synapses with the graft, and the graft in turn extends very
large numbers of new axons from the injury site over long distances into the distal spinal cord. Neural
relays across the injury are thereby formed, supporting functional improvement. This work is on a human
translational path and IND-enabling work is in progress.
This grant proposes two new directions that will be critically important in supporting human translation.
First, we recently reported that injured adult mouse CST neurons revert to an embryonic transcriptional
state that lasts for two weeks after SCI, a time during which CST axons can regenerate. This finding
establishes a critical period for intervention after mouse SCI to support recovery. Does the same
transcriptional reversion to a pro-growth embryonic state occur in the primate brain? If so, how long does
it last? Work in Aim 1 will definitively answer this question, identifying for the first time what may be an
optimal time window for therapeutic intervention of any type to support functional recovery in primates,
including humans. We will perform RNA sequencing (RNAseq) specifically of CST neurons after SCI in
rhesus monkeys using intersectional viral approaches, based on supportive preliminary data in monkeys.
In Aim 2 we propose for the first time using novel viral vectors to anterogradely, trans-synaptically trace
primate corticospinal projections to the spinal cord. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that rodent CST
axons project nearly entirely to spinal cord interneurons, whereas in primates the vast preponderance of
CST axons terminate directly on alpha motor neurons. Knowing the precise targets of CST projections to
the spinal cord will both markedly extend our basic knowledge of motor system organization in primates,
and will allow optimization of stem cell graft properties to enhance neural relay formation across sites of
SCI. Unlike other neural stem cell programs for SCI, our work aims to directly re-form critical neural
relays across a severe injury, rather than target spared axons through grafts of OPCs; knowledge gained
from this aim could markedly improve relay formation across injury sites in the primate system."
10772165,"Identifying predictors and elucidating mechanisms underlying psychosis onset are critical for the
development of targeted interventions. The current symptom-based clinical high risk (CHR)
syndrome has been validated as an indicator of future psychosis risk but does not provide
accurate predictions regarding individual clinical trajectories or a stratification model that informs
outcome or treatment response. The CHR phase is diverse in terms of risk factors and outcomes,
with a significant proportion of CHR converters (<30%) developing non-affective psychosis
(~73%) and a smaller group developing affective psychoses (~11%). In addition, CHR non-
converters have variable outcomes, ranging from full remission to ongoing multifaceted sequelae.
Furthermore, substantial neurobiological heterogeneity among CHR individuals is well-
documented. Despite this, little research attempted to harness the rich multimodal data collected
in large-scale CHR studies to form and validate neurobiologically driven CHR subgroups.
Successful parsing of the underlying heterogeneity of CHR may yield more defined subgroups
with distinct clinical trajectories and outcomes. Our group’s recent studies examining
neurobiological heterogeneity in psychosis spectrum using the Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network for
Intermediate Phenotypes dataset, adopted a data-driven cluster analytic method to define
biological clusters (or biotypes) using cognitive, and electrophysiological biomarkers agnostic to
traditional symptom-based diagnostic categories. The goal was to identify neurobiologically
homogeneous biotypes with presumed distinct underlying pathophysiology. However, the sample
consisted of chronic psychosis subjects and thus was unable to inform the development of early
intervention and prevention applications, and lacked clinically relevant longitudinal outcome data.
An approach focusing on CHR to define biotypes and assess them using longitudinal clinical, and
functional outcome data has yet to be attempted. The availability of prospectively characterized
and deeply phenotyped CHR samples from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study 2
and 3 is a unique opportunity to address this question using an objective approach. In the current
proposal, we will identify distinct subgroups or ‘biotypes’ for CHR using cluster analysis and will
compare, evaluate and validate the resulting biotypes. This proposal will have an important impact
on our understanding of how biological heterogeneity contributes to clinical outcomes in CHR and
elucidates a way to characterize biological heterogeneity in this population, providing biological
targets for more effective diagnosis, and early therapeutic intervention."

The ability to perceive and understand social interactions is crucial to daily life, and characteristically altered in
autism. From a brief glance, we can effortlessly recognize whether people are interacting, whether the interaction
is cooperative or competitive, and its communicative intent. However, little is known about the neural basis of
these abilities. We recently identified a region in the posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) that is selectively
engaged when viewing social interactions. This discovery, coupled with novel methodological and modeling
advances, creates an opportunity to investigate the neurocomputational underpinnings of social interactions. We
will measure fMRI, EEG, and computational modeling responses to both controlled and naturalistic stimuli to
investigate the neural basis of social interaction perception and understanding. Our central hypotheses are that
the pSTS is a key computational junction between the visual and conceptual representations of a social
interaction, and that it extracts these representations via two different computational mechanisms: bottom-up
pattern recognition (from visual information in body and motion-selective brain regions) vs. top-down cognitive
processes (based on input from the theory of mind network), respectively. Aim 1 will test for a neural hierarchy
of social interaction representations from visual primitives to abstract concepts. Using a condition-rich,
multimodal fMRI experiment, we will test the working hypothesis that social interactions are processed
hierarchically along a ‘third visual pathway’: with social primitives represented in body and motion-selective visual
regions, multimodal representations of social interactions in the pSTS, and higher-level social features along the
STS and theory of mind network. Aim 2 will identify the direction of information flow across the social interaction
network. By combining EEG recordings with our fMRI data from Aim 1, we can investigate the relative timing of
information flow across brain regions to determine whether different aspects of a social interaction (from visual
to conceptual) are extracted in a bottom-up versus top-down manner. We hypothesize that social interaction
detection and goal-compatibility (i.e., cooperation vs. competition) will be coded early in the pSTS via bottom-up
information flow from visual regions. In contrast, we hypothesize that other social evaluations will be represented
significantly later based on additional input from the theory of mind network. Aim 3 will identify the neural
computations underlying social interaction representations. We will compare our neural recordings with bottom-
up (discriminative) and top-down (generative) computational models, which directly operationalize the neural
computational theories outlined above, to understand the computations carried out across the social interaction
brain network. The proposed studies will provide novel insights into the neural computations used to recognize
social interactions. Understanding these mechanisms in typically developing adults is an essential first step
towards uncovering how these computations are altered in autism."

 Almost a million patients undergo heart surgery annually in the US, and perioperative heart rhythm
abnormalities including bradycardia and complete-degree heart block are one of the most common and fatal
complications of cardiac surgery. Implantation of temporary epicardial pacing leads is the standard of care for
patients undergoing cardiac surgery to provide on-demand pacing of the heart. Such leads prove necessary to
control potentially life-threatening bradyarrhythmias in approximately 15% of all post-operative cardiac surgery
patients. The current temporary epicardial pacing leads suffer from two major limitations: 1) Traumatic
implantation and removal processes. At implantation, the conventional leads in form of wires are pierced into
the epicardium to be anchored. This approach puts patients at risk of local hemorrhage, possibly cardiac
chamber perforation, and tamponade. After 1-2 weeks, the risk of these complications is even higher following
the removal of the pacing leads, by pulling them out of the epicardium. 2) Inflammation-induced capture
threshold elevation and early device failure. Trauma and foreign body response cause fibrous capsule
formation at the lead-tissue interface, which leads to loss of capture and early device failure. For instance, 60%
of right and 80% of left atrial leads fail by the 15th postoperative day.
 To address the abovementioned challenges, we propose to develop an electrically conductive
bioadhesive (e-bioadhesive) device that can offer: 1) robust atraumatic integration and on-demand
atraumatic removal, and 2) no fibrous capsule formation at the device-tissue interface, therefore providing
stable and effective pacing capability and improving patient safety throughout the hospitalization. Preliminary
data from joint publications of the MPIs in Nature, Nature Materials, Nature Biomedical Engineering, and Science
Translational Medicine validate that our e-bioadhesives can form instant, robust, and electrically conductive
adhesion to wet dynamic organs and also offer on-demand detachment. Here we aim to conduct a series of in
vitro, ex vivo, and rodent and porcine in vivo studies to develop and systematically benchmark our e-bioadhesive
devices in direct comparison to commercially used temporary epicardial leads. We will thoroughly assess and
optimize the e-bioadhesives’ attachment and detachment mechanisms, sensing and pacing capabilities, and
evaluate the tissue response to the e-bioadhesive. The design of the proposed e-bioadhesive devices should
allow for easy incorporation into existing clinical scenarios for temporary cardiac pacing, further accelerating the
clinical translation of this technology."

 Reconstructive surgeons are tasked with the restoration of soft tissue loss irrespective of etiology. Over
the past two decades, hydrogel scaffolds have become a vital platform for tissue revascularization and surgical
repair. However, their slow and random vascularization upon implantation often precipitates failure and precludes
true tissue regeneration and function. Native microvascular networks are characterized by organized tree-like
branching patterns that originate from large feeding vessels. Our objective is to utilize complementary
regenerative strategies based upon rigorous preliminary data that enables the rapid development of this
hierarchical microvasculature. To achieve our objective, we recently developed an innovative microsurgical
tactic termed vascular micropuncture (MP). In this method, small perforations are created using a needle in the
recipient vasculature to facilitate cellular extravasation and angiogenesis, without causing thrombosis or
significant hemorrhage. Such induced angiogenesis can be used to randomly vascularize an adjacently placed
hydrogel scaffold, leading to perfusion within 24 h and a doubling of neovascularization. With this compelling
result, we propose to advance the MP method using an emerging in situ microengineering technology. We have
developed granular hydrogel scaffolds (GHS) based on an extracellular matrix mimetic material with controlled
microporosity that improves cell infiltration and guides vascular network formation both in vitro and in vivo.
Our hypothesis is that customized GHS can be synergistically used with MP to hasten and precisely guide
hierarchical microvascular development. To test this hypothesis, we will focus on the following three independent
specific aims: 1) To design and optimize GHS to guide microvascular development, 2) To evaluate the effect of
MP characteristics to hasten microvascular development and 3) To evaluate the coupling effects of MP and GHS
to hasten and precisely guide hierarchical microvascular development. The successful completion of these
studies should markedly improve the vascularization of scaffolds used in soft tissue reconstructive surgery. Also,
it sets the platform for further investigation in building a hierarchical microvasculature that is cornerstone to blood
flow regulation, oxygen diffusion, and immune cell modulation. Consequently, our novel approach holds
immense potential for broadly advancing regenerative medicine."
10878768,"Severe bacterial infections are a major cause of global mortality and morbidity. An aberrant host response to infection leads to destructive inflammation and extensive tissue damage, resulting in organ dysfunction and multi- organ failure. An increasing incidence of gram-negative bacteria (GNB) resistance to antibiotics has been associated with increased mortality and significant public health problems in the world over last two decades. Uncontrollable inflammation is a critical feature of GNB pneumonia-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a devastating complication of severe sepsis. Since there are no specific treatment available, current research focuses on identifying new drug targets to diminish pro-inflammatory responses. Dysfunction of protein homeostasis in immune system has been known to contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic inflammation. Protein degradation is mainly controlled by the proteasome. Recently, a specific subgroup of the proteasome called the immunoproteasome has been identified to play a critical role in inflammatory responses including antigen presentation. In the preliminary study, we found that endotoxin increases immunoproteasome structural assembly; however, the molecular regulation of immunoproteasome structural assembly and its role in the pathogenesis of ARDS have not been revealed. We hypothesize that deubiquitinase USP14 determines immunoproteasome structural assembly, and that inhibition of the immunoproteasome diminishes NLPR3 inflammasome activation and GNB-induced inflammation. We will determine molecular mechanisms by which USP14 activation regulates LPS-induced immunoproteasome structural assembly. Next, we will determine the mechanisms underlying how the phosphorylation of USP14 by PKCδ promotes immunoproteasome structural assembly and severity of GNB-induced lung injury and sepsis. We will use state-of the art molecular approaches, human samples, and preclinical animal models. The data will lay the foundation for a significant mechanistic advancement regarding the molecular regulation of the pro-inflammatory responses through the modulation of the inducible immunoproteasome structural assembly, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of acute bacterial infection."

Transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis (ATTR) is a form of systemic amyloidosis either caused by mutations in the
TTR gene leading to aggregation and variant TTR amyloidosis (ATTRv; v is for variant) or from aggregation of
wild type TTR leading to ATTRwt amyloidosis. ATTRwt is becoming the most common form of systemic
amyloidosis, principally because of the aging of the population. ATTRwt cardiac amyloidosis (ATTRwt-CA)
almost exclusively affects individuals who >60 years and the average age at diagnosis is 77 years. Orthopedic
manifestations (carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) often bilaterally, biceps tendon rupture, joint replacements [hip,
knee, and shoulder] and lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS)) are collectively found in >80% of patients with ATTRwt-
CA. Affected individuals experience these orthopedic manifestations on 5 to 15 years prior to the diagnosis of
ATTR-CA. Our preliminary data from a NIA R21 grant (AG058348) shows that amyloid deposits are a common
cause of lumbar spinal stenosis and that a majority but not all amyloid deposits are due to TTR. The presence
of TTR amyloid in the lumbar spine could portend ATTR-CA in the future. Accordingly, we propose to conduct
a multi-center, prospective cohort study aimed at facilitating identification of individuals with ATTR-CA. The
aims of the study are: (1) To identify subjects with previous LSS Surgery who have evidence of TTR amyloid
deposits in their spinal specimens and could be at risk for ATTR-CA, and (2) To evaluate for ATTR-CA among
those with localized TTR in their spinal tissue. The hypotheses to be tested are (1) that at least 30% of spinal
samples will demonstrate amyloid and more than half of those with amyloid will be due to TTR as determined
by mass spectrometry and (2) that more than 20% of patients with TTR amyloid deposits in their spine will
have scintigraphy evidence of ATTR-CA, 5 to 15 years after spinal surgery as compared to <5% with
indeterminant type of amyloid in spinal tissue. We will also evaluate the cost effectiveness of this screening
approach. An exploratory aim is to evaluate an artificial intelligence technique for pathologic that can identify
amyloid histologically without Congo Red staining. By systematically evaluating older adults with LSS who
have previously undergone lumbar spine surgery thorough pathological evaluation for amyloid in surgically
obtained tissue, and if amyloid is present, performing tissue typing with mass spectrometry, there's a unique
opportunity to identify older adults with ATTR-CA early in the course of the illness. Early identification of
affected individuals is key because disease modifying therapies are significantly more effective before
significant cardiac dysfunction has occurred. The data collected in the planned studies could change clinical
practice. By routinely evaluating LS specimens for amyloid and determining the precursor protein, we could
facilitate early identification of those who develop ATTR-CA, a disorder that without recognition and treatment
is a progressive, highly morbid, and fatal. However, with programs aimed at screening and early identification
of affected individuals, we may be able to dramatically affect positively the outcomes of such patients."

Despite effective anti-retroviral therapy (ART) that maintains HIV at non-detectable levels in plasma, HIV is not
eradicated. When individuals are off ART, or during viral blips, CNS viral reservoirs can quickly rebound. We
and others have found that a population of CNS perivascular macrophages (PVMs) function as a major target
for HIV and SIV infection in the CNS, and the viral reservoir that persists with ART. Intracisternal (i.c.) injection
of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) demonstrate PVMs take up SPIONs within the CNS,
accumulate with SIV infection, and traffic out of the CNS where they are found in cervical draining lymph nodes
(cLNs), dorsal root ganglia, spleen, and bone marrow. Importantly, SPION-labeled CD163+ macrophages in the
cLN can be productively infected with SIV as evidenced by SIV-p27 immunoreactivity. It is our overall
hypothesis that an identifiable population of PVMs in the CNS functions as a cellular reservoir of rebound HIV
and SIV during ART, and after ART cessation, and these cells can leave the CNS with virus that potentially
reseeds the periphery. To test our hypothesis, we propose to use a CNS-penetrant colony-stimulating factor 1
receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor (BLZ945) that ablates these reservoir-reseeding CNS PVM early (3 months after ART
initiation) and late (5 months after ART initiation) during ART in virally suppressed macaques, and in animals
undergoing ART cessation. We propose to use 2 different fluorescently tagged SPIONs, injected intra-CSF just
prior to early and late BLZ945 treatments, in order to define the role of resident and repopulated PVMs to function
as a viral reservoir of SIV, and block their ability emigrate with virus. We propose to test our hypothesis with two
Specific Aims: Aim 1 will determine the extent to which CSF1R blockade can eradicate SIV in the brain and block
lymphatic-dependent reseeding of virus from the CNS to the periphery in the presence of ART; and Aim 2 will
determine whether CSF1R blockade can prevent reactivation of SIV reservoirs in the brain and repopulation of
viral reservoirs from the CNS to the periphery after ART interruption."
10849904,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy for which there is a critical need for improved
therapeutic strategies. While targeted and immune-based therapies have demonstrated encouraging results
recently, they have shown benefit in only a subset of patients and, thus, have yielded little to no impact on the
survival of unselected populations and even these benefits are limited by the rapid onset of resistance. There
are currently no standard markers for selecting treatment or evaluating therapeutic resistance, issues made more
challenging by the dearth of available tissue for molecular assessment in SCLC. Recent evidence from our group
and others suggests that SCLC is a molecularly diverse disease and can be divided into four subtypes largely
defined by the differential expression of three transcription factors [ASCL1 (SCLC-A), NEUROD1 (SCLC-N), and
POU2F3 (SCLC-P)], and a fourth subtype with high expression of inflammatory and mesenchymal markers
[Inflamed, (SCLC-I)]. Each subtype is characterized, in vitro, by distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities. Moreover, we
showed that genomic and immune intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH) portends poorer survival, while increasing
transcriptional ITH may be associated with therapeutic resistance in SCLC. The overarching goal of this proposal
is to systematically investigate heterogeneity in SCLC and its association with therapeutic response, and develop
tools to evaluate these features in the clinic. More specifically, we hypothesize (1) That SCLC is heterogeneous
and can be divided into major subgroups with distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities; and (2) That greater ITH-
assessed either at the genomic, immune, or transcriptional level- is associated with therapeutic resistance in
SCLC and can be assessed dynamically during treatment in a non-invasive manner using blood-based
biomarkers. To address these hypotheses, in Aim 1, we will assess whether these four molecular subtypes can
serve as predictive biomarkers in co-clinical trials in vivo and in retrospective patient tissue analyses, while also
developing blood-based strategies to identify the subtypes. In Aim 2, we will assess ITH at multiple molecular
levels, including genomic, transcriptomic, methylomic, and immunologic, to characterize how baseline ITH
influences patient survival. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will assess dynamic changes in transcriptional ITH following
treatment, using paired samples from in vivo models and patient samples, to determine if increasing ITH of
molecular subtype drives resistance and whether epigenetic modification may prevent or reverse it. The overall
hypothesis tested here is that careful initial molecular subtyping of SCLC tumors, paired with strategies aimed
at assessing, then limiting/reversing ITH, may better optimize the rate and duration of response to therapy. The
studies will be facilitated by a comprehensive library of patient-derived murine models and extensive clinical data
sets and executed by a multidisciplinary team of clinical/laboratory investigators, pathologists, computational
biologists, and others with a strong track record of innovation in SCLC and translating laboratory findings into
the clinic."
10819531,"Men of African ancestry (AA) have a higher incidence and mortality from prostate cancer (PCa) than men of
European ancestry (EA). These disparities are driven by the interplay between socioeconomic, lifestyle,
environmental, and biological/genetic factors. Growing evidence indicates that AA and EA men have differences
in their PCa immunobiology resulting in the differential expression of inflammatory gene pathways. These
differences may impact the anti-tumor immune response including the immune targeting of cell surface tumor
associated antigens (TAAs). There is an urgency to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying these
race-related differences and to harness them for identifying novel therapeutic targets. In this multi-PI exploratory
application, we propose to investigate differences in anti-tumor autoantibody responses to the glycolytic enzyme
enolase (ENO) in AA and EA men with PCa and exploit these differences for guiding the development of small
molecules targeting this protein as novel theranostics agents for advanced PCa. The rationale for the proposed
studies is supported by several key observations: 1) ENO, particularly the ENO1 isoform, is emerging as a cell
surface TAA with characteristics of an ideal theranostics target, whereas the ENO2 isoform could be a
theranostic biomarker for NEPC tumors; 2) AA and EA men with PCa produce a differential autoantibody
response to ENO; 3) this response has a distinctive impact on the migration of chemoresistant PCa cells; 4) the
expression of ENO2, a cell surface NEPC marker, but not that of ENO1, is lost in PCa cells with NEPC markers
as they transition to taxane resistance; and 5) we have initiated the design and characterization of novel boron-
based ENO1-targeting small molecules that will be evaluated for their antitumor activity and theranostics
potential in pre-clinical models of chemoresistant AA and EA PCa. These observations support the hypothesis
that EA and AA patients with PCa have distinctive immune responses to ENO that differentially affect tumor cell
properties, and that these responses may reveal tumor vulnerabilities that could be exploited for the development
of novel PCa theranostics agents. Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms underlying the differential reactivity and
antitumor effects of anti-ENO autoantibodies in AA and EA men with PCa. Aim 2 will synthesize and functionally
characterize novel boron-based small molecule ENO1 compounds as potential therapeutics for PCa. The
proposed study has high relevance as it will uncover the biological basis for the race-related differential anti-
ENO immunoreactivity. This will provide key insights into immune determinants contributing to PCa mortality
disparities. The study will also establish ENO as a potential theranostic target for advanced PCa, which could
lead to innovative clinical strategies to reduce overall PCa mortality and its racial disparities."
10834832,"CENTER ABSTRACT: Patterns of ongoing thought vary over time, and experiences like “mind-wandering”
show that cognition is often decoupled from an ongoing task. A traditional assumption is that states of off-task
cognition reflects a cognitive error. An emerging alternative view is that switching between “off-task” and on-
task states is a fundamental feature of human cognition, facilitating long term goals and mental health.
Experimental findings over the past several decades show that off-task cognition is accompanied by slow,
correlated fluctuations in neural/autonomic signals and behavior, and that these are strongly linked to slow
quasiperiodic shifts in large scale brain network activations. This Conte Center explores the cost/benefits of off-
task cognition while testing the overarching hypothesis that related slow fluctuations of neural activity
extending below 1 Hz, down to at least 0.01 Hz (timescales of seconds to 10’s of seconds) are critical
determinants of affect, cognition and behavior. We pose a set of linking hypotheses (Overview, b.2.a.), two
of which relate to features of slow neural fluctuations may represent organizing principles for brain operation.
First, local slow neural fluctuations link to larger scale slow brain network fluctuations (SBNFs) that
significantly impact cognitive processes like attention, behavioral indices like reaction times and autonomic
measures like cardiac variability and pupil diameter. Second, there is causal hierarchical coupling of neural
activity across frequencies extending from infraslow up to action potential frequency ranges; i.e., the phase of
lower frequency controls the amplitude of activity in higher frequencies. This “phase-amplitude coupling” (PAC)
provides a likely mechanism for network orchestration of excitability states in distributed ensembles of neurons,
that by definition, integrates across time scales. On one hand, the SBNF may be a tool the brain can use to
deploy and shift/re-deploy PAC and other resources according to momentary needs or task demands. On the
other hand, when endogenously-triggered SBNFs may provide the brain with a means of avoiding entrapment
of its resources by the demands of an immediate task or context. Despite our increasingly nuanced
understanding of individual brain network states and their transitions, the precise cognitive/behavioral functions
and the underlying physiological mechanisms of SBNFs remain largely open questions. We address these two
broad questions with an integrative program of research combining: 1) fMRI/EEG and intracranial (i)EEG in
humans, with fMRI/EEG and field potential/unit recordings in nonhuman primates (NHPs), and with autonomic
measures in all cases, 2) local cell circuit and network biophysical modeling, 3) experimental conditions
ranging from structured tasks to completely unscripted sessions and 4) approaches aimed at identifying causal
elements in network dynamics. The Center’s discoveries will contribute to the integrated mechanistic
understanding of the brain and to improved treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders."

(May 1, 2017 to March 31, 2022) that to date has supported 66 publications, with 12 more papers in
preparation or submitted at this time. The Center’s 5-year project period allowed us to mentor a number of
trainees and junior scientists, many of whom are now pursuing independent research careers. Several former
trainees are highlighted in leadership roles in our Center Renewal Application (see below). We have 4 projects
and 3 Cores as described below. Three of our four Projects, and two of our three Cores are led by returning
members of the original Center, including Drs. Schroeder (Center director, Project 3 (P3) leader and Core A
leader), Milham (Co-Center Director, Project lead P1), Knight (project Lead, P2) and Franco (Core C leader).
Two seasoned investigators, Stephanie Jones (Brown Univ.) and John Murray (Yale Univ.) have joined us to
form P4 (Computational Modeling), and two other investigators are co-leaders of Core B (Multimodal
Analytics). We are all leaders in our fields, as shown by our records of publications, grants and
conceptual/technical innovation. We each bring with us networks of trainees and colleagues who share our
continuing dedication to find a break-through in our mechanistic understanding of brain dynamics, as well as a
clear recognition that this is by necessity a multidisciplinary enterprise, ideally suited to, and in fact requiring a
support mechanism like the Conte Center. Core A has several necessary supervisory and administrative
functions, including, among other things, serving as the communication backbone of the Center, and
maintaining the highest standards of ethical and financial accountability across the Center. This core will also
be responsible for coordinating the External Scientific Advisory Board, the Seminar series, and the Annual
retreat as described in “Overview.” Beyond this our overarching goal is to provide the greatest possible
support for synergy across projects in the Center and for the Center’s intellectual agility so that it can exploit
new discoveries and adapt to problems and challenges that emerge during its funding cycle. We will pursue
this goal on multiple levels."
10834834,"ABSTRACT. Slow fluctuations in behavioral, cognitive, and neural states are an omnipresent feature of the
brain across species and are aberrant in multiple disorders of the nervous system. Slow brain network
fluctuations critically organize behavior across extended timescales: as drifts in arousal over minutes, as well
as our ability to switch between attending externally versus turning internally to plan our future actions and
dwell on recent experiences. Although the contribution of slow brain network fluctuations to behavior have
typically been studied by linking one network measure to one behavior, this project seeks to more broadly
understand slow fluctuations in healthy human participants by i) deeply characterizing their relationship across
multiple measures of brain activity, physiology, behavior, and cognition measured simultaneously and ii)
causally manipulating key factors of cognitive control and arousal which are hypothesized to orchestrate
relationships between slow network fluctuations and ongoing behavior or switching between modes of
externally versus internally oriented attention. To achieve these goals, Aim 1 will perform a deep
characterization of slow network fluctuations by collecting extensive multimodal neural and physiological
recordings in healthy human participants. Simultaneous fMRI, EEG, electrodermal activity, pupillometry,
respiration, ECG, and EMG will be recorded as participants perform an extended array of tasks ranging from
unstructured (rest) to highly structured attention-demanding tasks. Experience sampling will allow us to assess
the contents of ongoing cognition. This rich dataset will allow us to, in an unprecedented manner, measure and
link slow fluctuations across multiple modalities, map their relationship with behavior on externally-oriented
tasks and to the contents of internal cognition. While Aim 1 will examine the relevance of slow fluctuations to
performance on stimulus- driven tasks, our ability to direct attention internally likely has adaptive benefits, a
feature not typically captured in externally-oriented lab-based tasks. Aim 2a will fill in this gap by directly
assessing the contributions of slow brain network fluctuations to supporting internal processing that benefits
our subsequent behavior. Specifically we will measure brain patterns associated with learning and goal
planning tasks, and assess neural and behavioral markers of continued internal processing on these tasks
during a subsequent time period. This will allow us to directly link slow network fluctuations to benefits
associated with internally-oriented cognition, and measure trade-offs between internally- versus externally-
oriented modes of cognition. Another major question relates to regulation of slow network fluctuations. Aim 2b
will assess the potential causal contributions of two key factors, cognitive control and arousal, to slow
fluctuations and their resulting impact on behavior and cognition. These factors will be independently
manipulated via task demands and double-blind drug administration to assess their distinct contributions.
These experiments will dramatically advance our understanding of the role of slow brain network fluctuations in
orchestrating adaptive behavior and cognition."

Eukaryotic SLs are the basic building blocks of cell membranes and serve as key signaling molecules.
Bacterial synthesis of SLs is poorly understood, and almost entirely restricted to the phylum Bacteroidetes.
These microbes are generally considered symbionts of mammalian hosts. Although microbe-elicited chronic
dysregulated inflammation is central feature of soft and hard tissue destruction and periodontal disease
pathogenesis, this inflammation is, paradoxically, insufficient to clear the source of infection. Thus, subversion
of host immunity is central to the chronic nature of this disease. Research has shown that Porphyromonas
gingivalis, a member of the Bacteroidetes is uniquely capable of targeted and dynamic immune suppression,
yet little is known of the underlying mechanisms. Remarkably, our studies have illuminated the importance of
P. gingivalis SL in regulating the elicited host immune response to this organism and we have shown that
these SLs are transferred from this organism and incorporated into host cells – putatively understood as an
interkingdom communication system. The overarching hypothesis of the research we propose is that synthesis
of SLs affords P. gingivalis and possibly other oral Bacteroidetes a mechanism of immune regulation.
Specifically, our published and preliminary studies have determined that P. gingivalis secretes SL-containing
outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) that elicit only mild inflammation compared to OMVs from a P. gingivalis
mutant incapable of synthesizing SLs, and that the phosphoglycerol-dihydrocerimides (a subset of SLs)
containing OMVs are particularly adept at immune suppression. We are proposing that SL-OMVs are an
exquisite delivery system that forms the basis of a mechanism of P. gingivalis-host communication to control
inflammation. The goal of our proposed studies is to determine how P. gingivalis SLs contribute to OMV cargo
loading and subsequently how these SL-OMVs modulate the host innate inflammatory response. We will
interrogate host sensing of P. gingivalis SL-OMVs both in vitro and in vivo. As early innate immune responses
control host responses at mucosal surfaces such as the oral cavity, we will employ unique genetically modified
P. gingivalis strains, and OMVs isolated from these strains to determine which OMV-components are involved
in suppression. Molecular, immunologic, imaging, and transcriptomic, and biochemical techniques will be
deployed to elucidate the underlying functions of SL-OMVs and mechanisms of host innate signaling. Lastly,
we will use oral bone loss modelling to examine the virulence of P. gingivalis strains that are altered in the
synthesis of SLs. The rationale for these studies is that identifying immunoregulatory mechanisms used by
oral pathogens will provide prime targets for the development of therapeutic strategies. Thus, the long-term
goal of this research program is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying SL-mediated OMV delivered immune
suppression and to determine if bacterial SL-synthesis can be targeted for treatment and prevention of
periodontal disease."
10814939,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Advanced maternal age (i.e., ≥35 years old) is considered a major risk factor for birth defects. In women over 40
years of age, the incidence of spontaneous abortion can increase to >30%. Much attention has been focused on
ovarian function and oocyte quality, but we provide evidence that uterine decidualization defects could be a
major cause of age-related reproductive decline. This problem is likely due to a blunted progesterone (P4)
responsiveness of the aging uterus, via its cognate nuclear receptor PGR. PGR is the master regulator for the
establishment and maintenance of pregnancy; however, a significant diminution in PGR results in a blunted
hormonal response as the uterus ages. The underlying molecular mechanisms that diminish expression of PGR
and deregulate PGR target genes likely account for uterine aging, a mechanism that has remained elusive. Our
recent discovery of uterine Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) as a critical driver of age-related PGR action by which endometrial
stromal cells decidualize impacts our knowledge of uterine biology and reproductive aging. By deleting uterine
SIRT1 in mice, we generated a genetic model (PgrCre/+Sirt1f/f, i.e. Sirt1d/d) for research on premature uterine aging
due to blunted PGR response that are similar to those associated with physiologic aging. Thus, this study will be
the first attempt to use physiological (46-54 weeks of age) and genetic (Sirt1-deficient) aging mouse models
to discover a novel uterine perspective of mammalian reproductive aging. This proposal will provide the first
molecular characterization of implantation and decidualization in the context of premature uterine aging (genetic
aging; Sirt1d/d) by all-in-one multimodal single-cell ATAC-seq/RNA-seq and comparative analyses with
physiologic aging, identifying common gene signatures, cis-regulatory elements and transcriptional co-factors in
endometrial cells required for establishment and maintenance of pregnancy but susceptible to reproductive aging.
We will also translate the findings in mice to human biology using hTERT-immortalized human endometrial
stromal cells (T-HESCs) as decidualization of stromal cells are major defects during physiological and genetic
aging. Combined with multimodal single cell datasets between human and mouse models, as well as functional
validation of candidate cis-regulatory elements and transcriptional co-factors by CRISPR deletion and activation
systems, respectively, this proposal will delineate SIRT1-responsive regulatory network required for PGR actions
that deregulate as uterus ages. We strongly believe that our study will give a deeper and more comprehensive
insight into progesterone-resistant endometrium during reproductive aging. With that new knowledge, research
can pursue strategies to counteract adverse effects of aging on outcomes of pregnancy."

Exposure-based psychotherapies (e.g., prolonged exposure) are among the best supported treatments for
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), yet remission rates for these front-line treatments are typically only 50-
60%. These therapies aim to reduce anxiety towards trauma reminders by enabling therapeutic safety learning,
which is hypothesized to work via the mechanisms of fear extinction learning. As such, fear extinction
paradigms are widely used as laboratory models of exposure therapy, under the notion that treatments that
enhance extinction learning and recall in the lab may be promising candidates for improving the efficacy of
exposure-based therapies. Results from our recent clinical pilot studies (without an imaging component)
provided preliminary evidence suggesting moderate-intensity aerobic exercise can boost consolidation of fear
extinction memories and enhance cognitive indices of extinction recall – an effect that was mediated by
exercise-induced increases in anandamide (AEA; a primary endocannabinoid). Thus, this K01 project involves
a randomized controlled fMRI laboratory study to: 1) test whether different doses of aerobic exercise (light-,
moderate-, and high-intensity) delivered after extinction training improves cognitive, physiological, and neural
indices of extinction recall including enhanced retrieval of multivariate patterns of extinction memory encoding
(when tested 24hrs later), and 2) further probe the role of AEA by determining dose-response relationships
between aerobic exercise intensities and peripheral AEA concentrations (and whether the exercise-induced
increases in AEA mediate the aforementioned relationships) in trauma-exposed men and women with and
without PTSD (N=120). The PI will receive training and mentorship including: 1) training in computational
neuroscience theory and statistical techniques (e.g., multivariate imaging analyses and computational
modeling to analyze psychophysiological and neuroimaging data), 2) clinical exposure and expertise in clinical
models and neurocircuitry of PTSD and anxiety disorders, 3) gaining expertise in clinical trials to be able to
design, conduct, and analyze pharmacological and non-pharmacological RCTs as an independent investigator,
and 4) professional and career development activities to foster multi-disciplinary research collaborations. The
proposed training and research will occur at The University of Texas at Austin and includes domestic and
international collaborations with top-notch researchers, all of which have established extensive NIH research
portfolios spanning several fields such as: computational neuroscience, psychiatry, clinical psychology,
biostatistics, and pharmacology. Ultimately, the guidance and training experiences gained from the PI’s
mentorship team, and the results obtained from this K01 award, will serve as a scaffolding for the PI to become
an independent investigator capable of conducting impactful mental health research in PTSD and clinical
anxiety populations by utilizing a multidisciplinary lens and advanced methodologies from the ever-advancing
fields of psychiatry and computational neuroscience."
10915403,"Objectives. Terrorist acts or accidental poisoning involving acute exposure to organophosphorus (OP) agents,
such as nerve gases and OP pesticides (OPPs), pose a serious threat to induce mass casualties. Acute OP
toxicity results from inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), causing acetylcholine accumulation and
cholinergic crisis. Symptoms include increased secretions, respiratory distress, loss of consciousness, and
status epilepticus, causing permanent brain damage and death if untreated. Acute OP toxicity is currently treated
with atropine and pralidoxime (2-PAM) to mitigate cholinergic hyperstimulation, and midazolam to stop epileptic
seizures. This treatment reduces mortality, but only if administered within minutes of exposure and is thus not
realistic for treating the civilian population during a mass casualty. Moreover, adverse health effects may remain
after treatment. Thus, there is an urgent need for inexpensive therapeutics that can reduce mortality and alleviate
adverse effects when administered later. The rigor of the prior research is hampered because current mammalian
screening methods are slow and expensive, restricting the number of candidates that can be tested. High-
throughput screening (HTS) platforms that can rapidly and cheaply screen possible candidates promise to
accelerate the development of new therapeutics. The overarching goal of this research is to develop a cost-
effective HTS organismal platform to streamline and accelerate first-tier screening of possible therapeutics using
the planarian D. japonica. The specific objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that planarian HTS is
“fit for purpose” as a screening tool for therapeutic candidates that can alleviate the symptoms of acute OPP
exposure. Planarians are small flatworms with tractable, evolutionarily conserved neuronal circuits and a wide
repertoire of complex behaviors that are amenable to HTS. As invertebrates, they are considered a non-animal
organism. Unique to the planarian system, developing organisms are metabolically competent and can be
screened from exposure onset into adulthood, allowing for the assessment of toxicants in mixed populations.
Experimental approach. In Aim 1 will study the acute toxicity of 2 OPPs of concern, diisopropyl fluorophosphate
and parathion. Using HTS, we will characterize their toxicity profiles and evaluate lethality, morphology and
behavior in adult planarians at 30 minutes and 24 hours of exposure. In aim 2, we will verify that OPP-induced
seizures in planarians are true seizures by developing quantitative metrics for comparison with verified planarian
seizures and blocking of OPP-induced seizures with midazolam. In aim 3, we will demonstrate that acute OPP
toxicity in planarians is responsive to therapeutics and that OPP-induced symptoms can be alleviated using
combinatory treatment with atropine, 2-PAM, and midazolam, to establish a baseline to compare to novel drugs.
Expected results. This proposal will demonstrate the value of planarian HTS for testing therapeutic candidates
to treat OPP acute toxicity. The development of this rapid organismal screening method could be easily adopted
to other test paradigms, including different life stages, lengths of exposure, and chemical domains."

One of the core attributes of cells is their ability to grow and divide. This process is driven by a network of
proteins, commonly called the cell cycle machinery, which acts like a miniature engine driving cycles of growth
and division. How the proteins of the cell cycle machinery work together is relatively well understood. However,
the rules of their production from the corresponding genes are much less clear, and yet are equally important
to create a functional engine. Genes can differ widely in the strategy they use to produce their corresponding
protein. For example, they may produce more or less of the messenger RNA intermediate, the messenger
RNA or the protein may have a long or a short lifetime, and production can be directly linked to those of other
proteins or not. These features in turn influence the dynamic range of protein levels, the interaction between
proteins, and the robustness of the system in the face of perturbations. How expression strategies are
encoded in the DNA and how they contribute to proper protein function is poorly understood and therefore
limits our understanding of cell cycle regulation. Interestingly, different cell cycle regulators use different
expression strategies even when operating in the same pathway and it is likely that each strategy is selected
for optimal function of this protein within the cell cycle machinery. Our long-term goal is to understand how
these different expression strategies support cell cycle regulation, and how the information for a specific
expression strategy is encoded on the DNA. Our immediate goal is to understand how messenger RNA
features of select cell cycle regulators support the function of the protein that they encode. We will address
this question in fission yeast, a eukaryotic model organism that shares many features with human cells but
uses a minimal cell cycle machinery that is experimentally well-tractable. Gaining a deep understanding of
how different expression strategies are encoded in the genome will enhance our understanding of cell
physiology and will provide insight into the consequences of non-coding mutations that are observed in cancer
or other genetic diseases, thus promoting advances in precision medicine."

pathology. Despite continuous advances, however, MRI remains largely inaccessible to a sizeable and growing
group of patients who have conductive implants. The problem is exacerbated in children, for whom MR-
conditional devices are not readily available, leaving this vulnerable population unable to receive the standard of
care that they need the most, and excluding them from scientific inquiries when they are most advantageous.
The major risk of MRI in patients with conductive implants is the RF heating of the tissue due to the antenna
effect. This happens when the electric field of MRI scanner couples with the implanted device and amplifies the
specific absorption rate (SAR) of the radiofrequency energy in the tissue surrounding the implant. MR-conditional
implants have been approved by the FDA for adults, allowing patients to receive MRI under restricted conditions
that assure safety. Regrettably, however, neither MRI vendors nor device manufacturers have established safe
MRI methodologies for children with conductive implants.
We propose to develop, validate, and deploy a novel multi-platform MRI coil technology that allows ultra-fast and
high-resolution MRI to be safely performed in children with conductive implants regardless of the implant location
in their bodies. Our solution is based on the idea that through innovative engineering we can control local electric
fields generated by MRI on a case-by-case basis, thus avoiding interactions with the individual's implanted
device wherever it happens to be in the body. Our preliminary results show that this technique can achieve a 20-
fold reduction in RF heating of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CEIDs), as well as implants of central
nervous system (CNS) such as EcoG electrodes and Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS) devices. Such reduction
in RF heating is sufficient to support all clinical and research sequences of interest in brain and body imaging.
Here we propose to take this proof-of-concept to the next level and develop, implement, validate, and deploy the
first reconfigurable patient-adjustable (RPA) MRI coil technology tailored for imaging infants and young children.
Specifically, we propose to 1) Develop and validate a patient-adjustable rotating MRI transmit coil that eliminates
RF heating in children with cardiac and CNS implants, and 2) Develop age-optimized close-fitting head and body
receive arrays that integrate with the rotating coil and determine the range of imaging parameters that allow safe
deployment of the ensemble coil system in children with implants.
We are a multidisciplinary team including experts in MRI biophysics, instrumentation, and safety assessment,
clinicians with expertise and resources in pediatric radiology and pediatric surgery, as well as MRI vendors and
industry partners. If successful, our work brings state-of-the-art MRI accessible to children with implants. This
will allow methodical analysis of device parameters in emerging applications, improve our understanding of
existing indications, and brings unrestricted standard-of-care to pediatric patients with devices."

 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 One in four Americans are affected by skin disease, intensely motivating an understanding on the mechanisms
underlying epidermal homeostasis. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and the main arginine methyltransferase
PRMT1 are required for the control of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. We have identified two
nucleolar RNA helicases and multiple PRMT1 targets that are required for normal skin homeostasis. We have
also identified PRMT1 itself is an RBP. A long-term goal of my research is to understand homeostatic
mechanisms in skin; the goal of this K01 application is to characterize the roles of RBPs in epidermal
homeostasis, specifically the two helicases, PRMT1 and PRMT1 target RBPs.
 In Aim I, we will test our model for PRMT1’s maintenance of the progenitor state in keratinocytes. Our
preliminary data indicates that five stable RBP interactors of PRMT1 – which are also targets of its
methyltransferase activity – are also required to maintain homeostasis. In Aim IA, we test the consequence of
arginine methylation on these RBPs. In Aim IB, we test the effect of these RBPs and their methylation on gene
expression in keratinocytes.
 In Aim II, we test our model for how RNA helicases promote keratinocyte differentiation. Our data suggests
two helicases are sequence-specific, pre-mRNA-binding proteins that promote differentiation by departing the
nucleolus to regulate splicing and potentially transcription. Our results also suggest that these helicases can
form homo- and heterodimers, with the heterodimer being the strongest interaction. In Aim IIA, we will test their
role in transcriptional control of keratinocyte differentiation and whether their apparent control of splicing is direct.
In Aim IIB, we will evaluate their dimerization state and its relation to their role in homeostasis, splicing and
transcription.
 My background is in RBP biochemistry, bioinformatics, methods development, and CLIP-seq. Over the course
of the training period and within the environment of Stanford’s Department of Dermatology, I plan to acquire
expertise in (1) epithelial biology, (2) proteomics, (3) machine learning, and (4) statistics. My research interest in
skin biology requires this broad skill set, and this research plan will prepare me for an independent career as an
academic scientist working on the mechanisms of gene regulation in epithelial tissue."
10846689,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic cardiac disease and causes
major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) – e.g., arrhythmias, heart failure, and sudden
cardiac death. Invasive interventions to prevent MACE are available but can result in
complications. Current risk stratification strategy has limited power to predict which patient
would develop MACE and benefit most from preventive interventions. Furthermore, little is
known about the signaling pathways through which gene mutations mediate HCM pathobiology
and MACE. These major knowledge gaps have hindered efforts to prevent MACE in HCM. The
Harvard-Columbia Multi-center Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM2) Biorepository is an
ongoing 3-center prospective cohort that enrolled 615 patients with HCM during 2014-2022. In
this large multi-center HCM biorepository, investigators have collected high-quality
biospecimens – i.e., 615 plasma and 120 left ventricular myocardium. Follow-up data include
biannual interviews, medical record reviews, and in-person exam every year, with >85% follow-
up to date (median follow-up, 3.1 years). The present R01 project will extend this large well-
characterized HCM biorepository by transcriptomically profiling both myocardium and plasma
samples in parallel, and by examining their relations to both HCM disease status and MACE. In
Aim 1, we will examine the association of signaling pathway dysregulation in the myocardium
with HCM disease status using qRT-PCR, single-transcript RNA-FISH, and RNA-Seq. In Aim 2,
we will specify signaling pathways and plasma circulating microRNAs that predict new-onset
MACE using transcriptomic profiling. Finally, using an unsupervised clustering-based approach,
Aim 3 will define HCM subtypes by integrating genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and clinical
data, and determine their associations with MACE. Our prior studies and preliminary work lend
compelling support to our hypotheses. The present R01 project will provide a unique opportunity
to reveal the molecular mechanisms of HCM pathobiology and progression to MACE through
examining signaling pathways by applying transcriptomic profiling to paired myocardium and
plasma. Moreover, the proposed study will also derive a novel risk stratification system in HCM,
which will allow us to precisely identify high-risk HCM subtypes that would benefit from
preventive interventions. The project will provide a strong evidence base for developing targeted
pharmacotherapies to prevent HCM pathogenesis and MACE through the modulation of specific
signaling pathways. The investigators have complementary and integrated expertise in all
relevant fields. The study matches well with the NHLBI strategic plan for HCM research."
10817759,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Iodine deficiency has increased dramatically in the U.S. in recent decades leading to over 40% deficiency in
reproductive age women. Moreover, infertility and pregnancy loss are increasingly common with far reaching
physical, social, and emotional consequences. Targeted low-cost interventions are needed to address these
adverse reproductive outcomes. Iodine is a potential therapeutic for these outcomes as it is biologically
important for critical hormones involved in reproduction, placentation, and growth and development of
offspring. Severe deficiency is well known for its effect on hypothyroidism and irreversible brain damage in
offspring of deficient pregnant women. However, little is understood on the effects of deficiency on women's
fertility, fecundity, pregnancy loss, and other pregnancy complications. Research into the implications of
deficiency has proven quite challenging as it does not always present clinically and is incredibly variable day-
to-day. It is commonly recommended that 10 urine samples are needed to accurately classify iodine status of
an individual. Yet many studies fail to follow this recommendation and rely on a single spot urine which can
lead to grossly attenuated findings, hampering progress in iodine research. An accurate evidence base is
critically needed to inform policy and individual decisions on iodine fortification, supplementation, and dietary
intake, all which of which offer a potential low-cost solution to promote the health and wellbeing of women and
their offspring. We propose a novel application of biospecimen pooling to classify individual's iodine status and
overcome prior measurement challenges. We
pooling
have developed an innovative hybrid design that uses both
and random sampling to measure iodine in preconception and throughout pregnancy.The overarching
goal of this study is to investigate the role of iodine on reproductive and perinatal outcomes including rarely
studied outcomes of fecundability, fertility, very early pregnancy loss. This work will utilize the EAGeR study
(n=1228), an existing well-defined, preconception cohort of women at high risk for pregnancy loss with daily
urine collection preconception, and if they achieved pregnancy, during the first four weeks of pregnancy with
additional spot urine samples throughout, and collection of the placenta at delivery. Using novel biospecimen
pooling methods we will classify iodine status in preconception, early-, mid-, and late- pregnancy. Using a trial
emulation approach, we will investigate the effects of iodine deficiency, across critical periods of susceptibility
on reproductive and perinatal outcomes. We will also measure iodine in placenta samples; little is known about
how maternal iodine in gestation relates to placental iodine and how this interrelationship relates to pregnancy
outcomes. The successful completion of these aims with the novel characterization of iodine status from
preconception through gestation using biospecimen pooling and in the placenta will enable investigations into
iodine's role in reproductive and perinatal health. If implicated, iodine is a low-cost intervention, that could be
used to target women at risk for adverse outcomes."
10792627,"Subcerebral projection neurons (SCPN) reside in the neocortex, and extend axons to subcerebral targets in the
brainstem and spinal cord. Corticospinal neurons (CSN), a subclass of SCPN, project to the spinal cord and their
axons form the corticospinal tract (CST), a critical circuit for voluntary motor control. In addition, projections from
the neocortex to brainstem targets function in parallel with CSN to exert motor control. Degeneration of these
projection neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), along with degeneration of spinal motor neurons,
causes spasticity and paralysis. In humans, damage to the CST after spinal cord injury is a principal cause of
loss of voluntary motor control. Further, integrity of corticospinal connectivity is centrally linked to recovery from
stroke and cerebral palsy. There have been multiple investigations detailing the role of cortico-brainstem vs.
corticospinal projections in both motor control, as well as their distinct contributions to functional recovery in
these distinct causes of paralysis. However, it remains unclear when and how these distinct projections are
established during development. Understanding the molecular basis of this specification and differentiation
during development therefore holds significant promise in establishing approaches that are tailored to enhancing
plasticity of these related, yet distinct circuits. A necessary first step toward this ultimate goal is to identify the
molecular mechanisms directing SCPN axons to brainstem (cortico-brainstem neurons) versus spinal cord
(CSN). Ongoing work in our lab has identified that such projections are initially specified during the process of
axon extension during development. We have identified that cortico-brainstem and corticospinal neurons express
distinct genes and can be molecularly distinguished in mice by birth. Further our data suggest that the
transcriptional regulator Satb2 acts, in part, to specify cortico-brainstem neurons. This proposal investigates the
hypothesis that transcriptional regulation controls the development of cortico-brainstem vs. corticospinal
projections by late embryonic development in mice. Building on this foundation, we will first identify the time point
in development when these projections are specified using knock-in Cre reporter mice (Aim 1). This will be tested
using intracerebral injections of AAV-reporters at distinct developmental times in utero with adult analysis of
axonal projections. In Aim 2, we will investigate the transcriptional targets of Satb2 in SCPN at later
developmental times by profiling all SCPN in Satb2 WT and conditional KO mice, as well as by Satb2
overexpression, at single cell resolution. Finally, in Aim 3 using subpopulation-specific transgenic Cre lines, we
will investigate SCPN axon targeting in both Satb2 loss- and gain-of-function. In addition, we will investigate
whether misexpression of Satb2 target genes can alter SCPN targeting to the brainstem vs. spinal targets.
Together, our work will discern in-depth, the mechanisms of when and how transcriptional regulation controls
SCPN segmental “identity” thereby providing a mechanistic framework for subsequent identification of molecules
controlling segmentally appropriate SCPN connectivity with subcerebral targets."
10840352,"Project Summary
The proposed study will evaluate the economic impact of a major NIDA-funded prevention delivery and support
system for evidence-based preventive interventions (EBPIs) known as PROSPER (PROmoting
School/community-university Partnerships to Enhance Resilience). This research will build on the existing
randomized trial of PROSPER that delivered EBPIs to over 12,000 youth in rural communities 18 to 20 years
ago and cultivated sustained high-quality local prevention efforts. These community prevention teams selected
and implemented family-focused and school-based EBIs for middle school students in 6th and 7th grade. Initial
assessments followed students from pretest (6th grade) through 12th grade (five years post-intervention).
Prior funded research pointed to consistent findings for reduced substance misuse among intervention
participants. These earlier findings warrant further investigation of the economic implications. Consequently,
the proposed study will allow us to assess how long-term effects of the intervention will translate into economic
benefits through adulthood. Beyond estimating the full economic impact of the PROSPER system, we will also
assess how local program implementation and supportive systemic factors may influence the efficiency of
universal prevention efforts, providing needed information around how to build efficient substance abuse
prevention efforts.
The specific aims of this study are to: (1) Evaluate the economic impact of the PROSPER model for
preventing substance misuse; (2) Model how variation in local prevention infrastructure influences
economic impact; and (3) Assess how individual risk factors impact prevention efficiency. Prior work
demonstrated how the resources necessary for program delivery can be managed more efficiently within a
prevention delivery system that cultivates sustainable funding streams to support long-term dissemination. The
proposed research would follow this investigation by evaluating how these increased efficiencies can improve
the likelihood for positive economic benefit resulting from intervention effectiveness. Importantly, this inquiry
will examine the range of expected economic outcomes given variation in implementation factors for program
delivery, leveraging unique detailed data assessing this. Further, investigations of how economic impact may
vary due to participant characteristics will further inform policy makers of the range of outcomes that could be
expected. Thus, this research provides a unique opportunity to determine the long-term economic benefit from
an efficient prevention delivery system’s impact on reduced substance misuse and risky behavior among
adolescents."

The proposed program will continue to build sustainable research ethics and integrity capacity in Ghana through a
joint partnership between New York University Grossman School of Medicine (NYU GSOM) and University of Ghana
School of Public Health (UG SPH). The NYU-UG Research Integrity Training Program (NYU-UG RITP) addresses
the considerable need for research ethics and integrity training through three initiatives: (1) the strengthening of
faculty and enhancement of curriculum at the new MSc. in Bioethics Program at UG SPH through a faculty exchange
program, faculty development workshops, co-development and co-delivery of a series of short courses on emerging
bioethics issues, support for advanced study, mentoring, co-teaching of MSc. courses, and annual program
evaluations, all aiming to ensure the program’s self-sufficiency and long-term sustainability; (2) the development and
implementation of a capacity building program consisting of short courses and workshops informed by needs
assessments and designed to meet the most urgent and important training needs of personnel at key institutions in
Ghana’s research ethics system; and (3) the continuation and expansion of the NYU-UG Fellowship Program in
Research Integrity (a) to provide 24 fellows with master’s-level certificates in research ethics to populate local
research regulatory and educational systems, and (b) to provide mentoring and career development opportunities to
Fellowship graduates, including fellows from NYU-UG RITP’s first phase. We will expand our Fellowship Program’s
impact by enrolling trainees from Liberia and Sierra Leone and by facilitating the emergence of the West Africa
Research Ethics Network (WAREN), whose members will include graduates of our program and of Fogarty training
programs in the West Africa subregion (e.g., Nigeria, The Gambia). Our Fellowship Program will train 2 cohorts of
12 fellows, each cohort comprising 6 trainees from Ghana, 3 from Liberia, and 3 from Sierra Leone. Six outstanding
fellows will enroll in the UG SPH program, preparing them to join that program as faculty or to lead future training
programs in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Fellows will be selected from researchers who have completed MDs or
master’s or doctoral degrees in relevant fields so that the training can build upon their expertise and experience with
research methods and local health needs. The one-year Fellowship Program will offer intensive courses in the history
and philosophy of research ethics, research integrity, and developing a collaborative research output. Fellows will
also complete a practicum experience in the ethical review of research or a mentored collaborative research project
on an issue in research ethics or integrity of special importance in the local context. Courses will be co-developed
and co-delivered by expert faculty from NYU GSOM and UG SPH. UG SPH faculty will contextualize the curriculum
to ensure its cultural relevance. Graduates will contribute to the bioethics literature studies of research ethics and
bioethics issues of special significance in Ghana and the subregion, contributions that are essential to reframing
discussions of international research ethics and including LMIC-based researchers’ priorities and perspectives."

study of a novel neuromodulatory treatment for Veteran [social and occupational functioning], impulsivity and
[suicidal ideation] following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). The candidate’s first aim will examine the
tolerability, safety and feasibility of frontal pole intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) for Veterans with mild
traumatic brain injury (mTBI), negative urgency impulsivity, [and suicidal ideation]. This is important because
impulsivity, which is exhibited in up to 40% of individuals with TBI, is an independent risk factor for dying by
suicide and is associated with poorer functional outcomes following TBI. Presently, there are no widely
accepted treatment strategies for impulsivity, [suicidal ideation and social and occupational functional deficits]
following TBI. The candidate’s second aim is to determine the effects of frontal pole iTBS on social and
community functioning, negative urgency impulsivity and [suicidal ideation]. This will allow the scientific
community to better understand how frontal pole iTBS treatment impacts [social and community] functioning
and mental health outcomes. Finally, the candidate aims to evaluate whether iTBS improves connectivity
between the VMPFC and limbic system, using resting state functional connectivity MRI. Completing this aim
will allow us to better understand how iTBS affects neural connectivity and whether these changes are related
to functional and mental health outcomes.
 This research is critical as suicide is a major issue among Veterans within the VA system. Veterans are
22% more likely to die by suicide than civilians. Veterans with TBI are even more likely to die by suicide than
those without TBI. It is important to create a treatment to prevent unnecessary Veteran deaths while helping
Veterans feel empowered and functional within their communities. [Suicide and TBI are not unique to Veterans,
however. Civilians with TBI are also more likely to die by suicide than those without. Thus, findings from this
research could serve to improve neuropsychiatric care in the civilian sector, as well.] This project serves as a
critical first step in allowing the candidate and her team to develop a biologically-informed treatment strategy
for the many individuals who struggle with mTBI, [social and occupational functional deficits], impulsivity and
[suicidal ideation].
 Ultimately, the candidate’s long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical researcher in the
VA system with expertise in TBI, suicidality, neurostimulation and neuroimaging. As such, she will complete a
careful training plan under the mentorship of a strong, multidisciplinary training team involving opportunities for
networking with experts in fields relating to the above research, hands-on training in necessary research skills
and coursework complementary to the research project.
 The planned research is significant, innovative, and impactful, as it will be the first pilot study of a new
iTBS treatment paradigm, designed to improve Veteran lives and functional outcomes after mTBI. It will also
strengthen the candidate’s knowledge base and research skills, preparing her for an independent career in
post-TBI rehabilitation research, with expertise in impulsivity, suicidality and neuromodulation."

The overall goal of this T32 Institutional National Research Science Award proposal is to support predoctoral
training in chemical senses research through the Training Program in Chemosensory Science (TPCS) at the
University of Florida. The study of the chemical senses (smell, taste, chemesthesis and internal
chemosensing) has broad impacts on human health, including: the effects of smell or taste impairments (e.g.,
anosmia, phantom tastes, etc.) on eating, nutrition, safety, interpersonal relationships and the incidence of
depression; the engagement of normal smell and taste to promote healthy eating; the contribution of
maladaptive chemosensory behaviors to overconsumption and its related diseases (e.g., diabetes,
hypertension, etc.); and the control of disease vectors and parasites through disruption of host seeking or
reproduction. Unfortunately, chemosensory scientists with the appropriate methodological expertise and
requisite knowledge in this multidisciplinary field continue to be in short supply. This need creates a strong
impetus for building an integrative predoctoral training program in chemosensory science. The chemosensory
research community at the University of Florida – highly diverse in research questions and methodologies, but
organized and integrated through the UF Center for Smell and Taste – is uniquely positioned to lead this
program.The TPCS has four Specific Aims: (1) To conduct a successful program of predoctoral training in
chemosensory science composed of a didactic curriculum, a series of chemical senses research-focused
discussions, a mentored research experience, a patient outreach experience, and professional development; (2)
To link predoctoral trainees with strong research mentors and a multidisciplinary committee of experienced
investigators; (3) To recruit talented and diverse trainees from national and local pools of eligible candidates;
and (4) To evaluate the program in terms of educational objectives tailored to the pre-doctoral program. This
renewal application seeks five years' funding for the TPCS to support four predoctoral students per year (two in
each of two years of training support per trainee) with the aim of producing independent scientists capable of
making significant contributions to the science of smell, taste and chemesthesis. At the conclusion of the period
of support, a diverse group of predoctoral trainees will have been mentored and taught the advanced methods,
fundamental knowledge, and multidisciplinary approaches necessary to further chemosensory research.
Together, this program provides a comprehensive training in chemosensory science that will effectively prepare
our trainees for the wealth of chemosensory science careers available."

 To enable the preparation of bioactive molecules with increased complexity, it is imperative to develop
both the synthetic logic (the design concepts) and the synthetic tools (the chemical reactions) to assemble
molecules with chiral centers and polycyclic frameworks. The proposed research program seeks to address
this need through chemical research in two general areas. The first research area will focus on the synthesis
of complex, highly oxidized, biologically active diterpenes. These total synthesis efforts inspire the
invention of new reactions and investigate the ability of existing reactions to solve strategic bond constructions
in complex settings. Synthetic access to these natural products will transform our ability to use them and their
synthetic derivatives as biological probes or as lead compounds for the development of new medicines. The
second research area will focus on the development of new Ni-catalyzed cross-electrophile coupling
reactions. These reactions have emerged as versatile methods for carbon–carbon bond formation that are
increasingly being adopted by chemists in academia and the pharmaceutical sectors. Despite recent
advances, several challenges remain, particularly with respect to the development of catalyst-controlled
stereoselective cross-electrophile coupling. To address these challenges, this research seeks to 1) identify
new modes of electrophile activation to broaden the scope of products that can be prepared by Ni-catalyzed
cross-electrophile coupling; 2) develop stereoselective cross-electrophile coupling reactions of small rings for
medicinal chemistry and natural product synthesis; and 3) develop enantioselective CEC reactions of
feedstock building blocks such as carboxylic acids and olefins. The expected outcomes of this research
program are two-fold: it will provide new reactions and strategies for preparing complex polycyclic molecules,
and it will provide access to medicinally relevant natural products and their derivatives. This research will be
carried out by a team composed of the PI, four chemistry graduate students and one postdoctoral researcher.
As part of this project, the graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will receive rigorous training in the
theory, methods, and strategies of organic chemistry. The successful execution of this research will provide
new tools to enable the synthesis of small molecules for the study and treatment of human disease."

Biocompatible chemical transformations that are promoted by light have become powerful tools in chemical
biology by virtue of enabling spatiotemporal control over activity. Whilst genetically encoded photoactivatable
tools have become mainstays in the bio-orthogonal toolbox, light driven conjugation methods that effectively
interface with native biomolecular structures (no genetic encoding) under biologically relevant conditions, are
comparatively limited. In this project, we will evolve a method recently developed by our group for the
photobioconjugation of Tryptophan (Trp) residues using redox-active N-carbamoylpyridinium salts that engage
Trp in photo-induced electron transfer. We will show that, by carefully modulating the optical and electrochemical
properties of these reagents, that we will be able to both (1) dramatically enhance the kinetic capabilities of this
labelling reaction and (2) enable the discovery of new mechanistic paradigms that promote this labelling
chemistry. Moreover, we will demonstrate that, through careful manipulation of optical and electrochemical
properties of the N-carbamoyl pyridinum salt reagent, that we will be able to invoke mechanistic control over Trp
labelling in a wavelength-dependent fashion (i.e. we can control reaction mechanism with a given wavelength
of light). This, in turn, will allow us to design new application-based experiments that can both command precise
reaction outcomes and markedly expand the capabilities of photobioconjugation chemistry. Specifically, we will
harness this optical and mechanistic control for the design of new activity-based sensing applications as well as
through the design of proximity labelling approaches that we apply to the study of poorly understood processes

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is prevalent and a major cause of morbidity and mortality; a portion
of the risk for the condition is familial. A significant portion of inherited risk for AUD likely
involves dominance of glutamate over dopamine in brain circuits governing certain types of
reward responsiveness, impulsivity and learning. Project 2 will use the mGluR5 negative
allosteric modulator drug mavoglurant as a probe in conjunction with 4 functional MRI
paradigms to understand how the drug targets the brain systems implicated in familial
alcoholism risk. These fMRI paradigms are 1. Response to rewards and punishments (monetary
incentive delay task, MID), 2. Inhibiting response to prepotent cues (go/no-go task, GNG), 3.
Responsiveness to alcohol-related as opposed to soft-drink or neutral cues (alcohol cue
reactivity task, ACR) and 4. the ability to benefit from “model-based,” goal-directed learning
strategies versus “model-free” learning, that is a less advantageous strategy involving
dominance of immediate rewards or habit over behavior (multi-stage decision-making, MSDM
task). This project will compare equal numbers of individuals who have strong positive family
history of alcoholism and are thus at increased risk for the disorder (family history positive or
FHP) to those who have no affected relatives (family history negative or FHN).
We will compare fMRI-assessed brain responses during task performance following single
doses of mavoglurant and placebo, administered under double-blind, randomly assigned, cross-
over conditions, at 2 separate visits. We predict that on placebo FHP will: 1. Be overly-
responsive to rewards on the MID, 2. Show different brain signaling during performance of the
GNG and ACR, and 3. Manifest an instrumental learning bias on the MSDN accompanied by
altered relationships between nucleus accumbens and medial frontal cortex. Unifying these
predictions, we also hypothesize 4. That in the case of MID, ACR and MSDM, but not the GNG,
these altered brain circuit relationships in FHP will be restored by the study drug mavoglurant
such that they more closely resemble patterns seen in FHN in the placebo condition.
The use of variants of the MSDM task provides a useful conceptual link that binds the three
major CTNA projects together, offering the opportunity to link understanding of neural circuits
related to AUD, alcoholism risk and alcohol-related learning bias in a specific, focused,
neurotransmitter receptor hypothesis-driven context."

Suchitra Krishnan-Sarin, Ph.D.
Abstract
One of the main goals of the Center for Translational Neuroscience on Alcoholism (CTNA) is to
develop novel treatments for alcohol use disorders (AUDs). Understanding the neurochemical
mechanisms underlying drinking behaviors is key to the development of treatments for AUDs.
CTNA’s focus is on medications that target alcohol-related changes in the cortico-striatal
circuitry, specifically the glutamatergic pathways that promote drinking through altering the
balance between reward-related (model-based) and habitual (model-free) reinforcement. This
project, P3, links the mechanisms studied in P1 and P2 to targeted clinical examinations of
medications on alcohol drinking in heavy drinkers, and is a critical component of CTNA-5. We
propose to examine the influence of mavoglurant (MAV), a negative allosteric modular (NAM) of
the mGluR5 receptors, which may directly or indirectly (through NMDA receptors) normalize
alcohol-induced disturbances in cortico-striatal glutamate signaling. Existing preclinical and
clinical evidence suggest that mGluR5 receptors are upregulated by alcohol use, and preclinical
evidence also suggests that mGLuR5 NAM’s reduce alcohol drinking and reinstatement of
drinking after abstinence. We are fortunate to have access to MAV, a potent, selective, orally
bioavailable mGluR5 NAM developed by Novartis, which is safe and tolerable in multiple
neuropsychiatric populations. Our pilot evidence in social drinkers support the safety of MAV
(200 mg/day), even when combined with alcohol, and suggests that MAV reduces intoxication
from alcohol and brain responses to alcohol cues. P3 will examine the influence of MAV versus
placebo on lapse-relapse to alcohol drinking among heavy drinkers with AUD. P3 is inherently
innovative in both its conception and application because it identifies an important gap in clinical
knowledge – if targeting mGluR5 receptors influences alcohol craving and drinking - and then
brings to bear an experiment which combines a novel therapeutic agent (MAV) and two novel
behavioral science tools, the Cue-Exposure Paradigm (CEP) and the Alcohol Drinking Paradigm
(ADP) to investigate this question. P3 will address the primary questions of whether
mavoglurant alters alcohol drinking and craving, and other alcohol effects, in the CEP and the
ADP, and explore the associations of sex, family history of alcoholism and impulsivity to these
changes. The project is served by the clinical and translational cores of the CTNA but also
supports the goals of these cores to explore unique questions about how MAV changes model-
free/model-based behaviors, and the role of polygenic risk scores in the effects of MAV."
10874489,"Project Summary/Abstract
Approximately one in five Americans live in a rural-designated area, representing 97% of the country’s land
mass.1 The broad geographic distribution of rural America presents unique challenges for those seeking health
services, particularly when experiencing a time-sensitive emergency such as heart attack, stroke, or trauma.
Rural patients requiring time-sensitive medical care are often transferred via helicopter to urban academic
medical centers which has been shown to be a lifesaving intervention and thus considered critical healthcare
infrastructure.2,3-10 However, what is unknown, is the role of rurality in the use, cost, and outcomes of
interhospital transfer (IHT), vital information that is needed to increase access and decrease disparity in
outcomes. Identifying factors that contribute to poor outcomes for IHT patients is significantly complicated due
to a lack of comprehensive datasets that include all sources of data necessary to disentangle the complex
relationships between patient health and post-IHT outcomes disparity in relation to patient location and place-
based social determinants of health (SDOH). Current inclusion of SDOH data, data merged to other datasets
by location, are included in a non-specific manner, often classifying all patients into broad categories such as
rural versus urban and usually at the county level, or more broadly as rural designation for the entire
comparative group. This lack of consistency hinders our ability to understand the nature of IHT use—especially
in rural or underserved areas. As a result, guidelines and protocols remain flawed because they are based on
inconsistent conceptual definitions of rurality and data points that are not reliable or valid. Therefore, in order to
provide a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of the true relationship between the complicated
intervention of IHT and the role of SDOH in rural settings, new approaches to data management and analysis
are needed. The purpose of this proposal is to build an integrated data management platform that will combine
robust health system electronic health record data, transport data and social determinants of health data into a
spatial database where various geospatial manipulations, queries, and analysis can be performed. Once
established, we will use the analytic platform to conduct several analyses. Guided by the NIMHD research
framework, we will examine individual (e.g., transports), community (e.g., hospitals, transport services,
geographic distribution, census), and societal (e.g., reimbursement policy) influences on rural access to IHT. If
successful, we will be able to define and identify rural regions with limited IHT services—critical access
regions—to provide needed evidence to support improving access to care and reducing patient financial harm.
Further, data from this innovative platform will provide a dynamic analytic tool and data resource for research
and public use that currently does not exist. The dynamic capability of including updates as new datasets are
released, will provide a powerful tool to monitor and assess changes in IHT practice over time, providing a
reliable and valid system to assess the effect of policy changes and reimbursement practices in rural settings."
10868658,"This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development application (K23) will provide protected time for
Dr. Margo Hurlocker to become an independent researcher at the University of New Mexico (UNM) and Center
on Alcohol, Substance use, And Addictions (CASAA). Her goal is to develop the expertise to integrate and test
implementation strategies within clinical trial designs to improve the treatment delivery system and client
engagement in addiction and other behavioral treatment programs. As a first step in developing expertise in
addiction implementation science, the candidate proposes an original, mentored research study focused on
replacing the comprehensive assessment with an evidence-based intervention (Motivational Interviewing [MI])
during a client’s initial contact with an addiction treatment program to improve client entry, engagement and
retention. Addiction treatment programs have some of the highest premature dropout rates and approximately
44% of clients drop out after the intake assessment. The assessment-based intake may contribute to the high
rates of client dropout given the emphasis on gathering information rather than exploring client reasons for
seeking treatment. This study builds on a large body of literature supporting MI as a prelude to other evidence-
based treatments to facilitate treatment engagement, by using an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design
to (1) examine the clinical utility of MI at intake on client’s entry and engagement in treatment, and (2) use a
mixed-methods approach to evaluate treatment personnel’s’ perspectives of implementation feasibility. Also,
in-treatment factors (readiness to change; working alliance) are examined as putative mechanisms of
engagement-related outcomes given pre-treatment factors tend to account for a small amount of variance in
client dropout. This mentored study will offer hands-on training to help the candidate develop the expertise to
establish her own independent addiction research program. With the guidance of her mentorship team, Dr.
Hurlocker’s training plan and mentored study are integrated and will promote a comprehensive skill set in the
following areas: (1) conducting clinical effectiveness research in addiction treatment programs (Theresa
Moyers & Barbara McCrady; UNM), (2) implementation theory and application (Geoffrey Curran; UAMS &
Kamilla Venner; UNM), (3) implementation process evaluations (Theresa Moyers; UNM & Geoffrey Curran;
UAMS), and (4) advanced quantitative analyses of client and provider data (Katie Witkiewitz; UNM). All
mentors will also assist Dr. Hurlocker in grant preparations and submissions throughout the award period. In
addition to training at CASAA, Dr. Hurlocker will complete substantive coursework with the Institute for
Implementation Science Scholars at Washington University in St. Louis and advanced quantitative coursework
at UNM. Collectively, Dr. Hurlocker’s training goals and mentored study are in line with NIDA’s attention to 1)
the development of innovative methods to improve the healthcare delivery system, and 2) the identification of
in-treatment mechanisms that can promote patient engagement (e.g., PAR-18-007)."
10869961,"ABSTRACT
Unbiased genomic approaches have led to discoveries of novel disease genes and variants. Most pathogenic
rare variants found in patients with Familial Pulmonary Fibrosis (FPF) and Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF)
result in telomere shortening. Thus, these diseases are part of the spectrum of diseases known as
telomeropathies or short telomere syndromes. Telomere lengths of peripheral blood cells predict clinical
outcomes of IPF patients, including survival, rate of disease progression, and response to certain medications.
A larger proportion of FPF and IPF patients have evidence of telomere shortening than are explained by
genetic mutations. This study seeks to use whole genome sequencing to identify genetic variants that
engender an inherited susceptibility to lung fibrosis. The underlying hypothesis of this application is that
telomerase dysfunction is a key mechanism underlying development of pulmonary fibrosis.
This application plans to evaluate whole genome sequence (WGS) data obtained for a discovery cohort of
~950 unrelated FPF probands and IPF patients. In Aim 1, we will estimate telomere length from the WGS data,
identify rare coding and noncoding qualifying variants in the telomere genes, assess genotype-phenotype
relationships, and study the return of genetic results to patients and their physicians. This aim will allow for
assessment of known telomere genes in well-phenotyped patients. Since a large portion of FPF and IPF
patients with telomere lengths <10th percentile have no identifiable telomere-related pathogenic or likely
pathogenic variant, we will utilize WGS data and five independent strategies to identify novel candidate genes:
analysis of variants by genomic location, analysis of rare variants by gene-based collapsing tests, analysis of
common variants by GWAS, analysis of variants using a sliding window test, and analysis of copy number
variants. Candidate genes and variants identified in the discovery cohort will be evaluated in replicate cohorts.
This aim has the potential to discover new genes linked to pulmonary fibrosis and telomere biology. In Aim 3,
we will explore three avenues of functional investigation: through assessment of co-segregation in informative
kindreds, through in vitro studies of gene function in patient-derived lymphocytes and other cell types, and
through evaluation of CRISPR/Cas9-engineered mouse models of disease. The latter aim will focus on
elucidating the function of PARN, a de-adenylase that has an important role in the post-transcriptional
maturation of telomerase RNA, with regard to the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Overall, this application
plans to use WGS, large FPF and IPF cohorts, as well as cutting-edge statistical analyses and experimental
approaches to extend our knowledge of the genetic architecture of pulmonary fibrosis and human telomere-
related diseases."
10837127,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains elusive. Inheritance of the apolipoprotein (APO) E4 allele
is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic late onset AD, whereas the APOE2 allele is protective and the
most common APOE3 allele is neutral. While the mechanisms by which APOE4 modifies the risk of AD are not
fully elucidated, compelling evidence indicates that the pathogenic effects of APOE4 are mediated by lipid-
related pathways. Integrative multi-omics studies have consistently demonstrated the strong association of lipid
pathways with AD phenotypes and that APOE4 disrupts intra/intercellular lipid homeostasis in cellular, organoid,
and animal models as well as postmortem brain tissue from individuals carrying different APOE alleles with or
without AD. Intriguingly, emerging evidence suggests that specific species of lipids/metabolic alterations in
subcellular organelles, in particular mitochondria, lead to neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. Mitochondria are
the powerhouse of cells and provide the energy to sustain vital cellular functions. Notably, brain contains two
major populations of mitochondria, the synaptic mitochondria that originate from the synaptic bouton of neurons
and the non-synaptic mitochondria that originate from neuronal and glial cell bodies. Lipidomic analysis indicates
that synaptic and non-synaptic mitochondria have distinct lipid profiles that regulate compartmental energy
metabolism in the brain. Importantly, dysfunction of mitochondria, especially synaptic mitochondria, is well
established as one of the earliest deficits in the progression of AD. APOE4 has been associated with increased
impairment of mitochondrial structure and function compared with APOE3 in various models and human patients.
However, whether APOE genotypes regulate the lipidome of mitochondria during brain aging and whether the
dynamic changes of mitochondrial lipidomes affect the progression of AD are unknown. We hypothesize that
mitochondrial lipidomic dynamics and its interaction with APOE4 drive pathogenic brain aging and AD. Three
independent yet interrelated specific aims are proposed to test the hypothesis, using both mouse models and
human brains and a combination of behavioral and pathological approaches, coupled with innovative targeted
and unbiased cellular, molecular technologies, including lipidomics, transcriptomics, and brain clearing and 3D
imaging. Aim 1 is to assess the impact of APOE isoforms on mitochondrial lipidomic dynamics associated with
brain aging in humanized APOE4 and APOE3 mice. Aim 2 is to elucidate the relationship between mitochondrial
lipidomic dynamics and the progression of cognitive deficits and amyloid pathology in APP/PS1 mice. Aim 3 is
to define the interaction of mitochondrial lipidome with different APOE isoforms and its relation to cognitive
function and AD pathology in human brains. The results are expected to uncover the impact of mitochondrial
lipidomic dynamics and its interaction with APOE on brain aging and AD, and identify novel targets/pathways
that can be harnessed as diagnostic biomarkers and/or for therapeutic development to defeat AD."
10820416,"For decades, there has been a critical gap in translating preclinical work on mechanisms of contusion expansion
in traumatic brain injury (TBI) to clinical therapies that improve outcome. This is important because contusion
expansion is a major driver of unfavorable outcome in TBI with up to 5X increase in morbidity and mortality, yet
there are no treatments or biomarkers to identify patients at risk. There is immense potential to address this
issue because unlike primary injury, contusion expansion results from host response to the initial TBI and thus
is a modifiable secondary injury. Guideline-based care uses a reactive templated approach to this hugely
complex process without addressing individual differences in contributory pathways; it does not prevent or limit
contusion expansion and struggles to mitigate the life-threatening consequences. Such homogeneous strategies
for a heterogeneous disease have unsurprisingly led to many failed clinical trials. Our long-term goal is to
harness relevant individual data (molecular, single-cell [SC], genetic, imaging) to direct precision medicine for
TBI contusion expansion. This R21 addresses existing knowledge gaps in a promising therapy for contusion
expansion being primed for translation: Glyburide (GLY). Existing research generated exciting momentum but
also revealed major individual differences in GLY targets that could affect drug-response/successful translation.
Our objective is to use SC and proteomic strategies to molecularly endotype GLY-targeted pathways of
contusion expansion in human TBI. The rationale is that it allows us to better understand heterogeneous benefits
and opportunities of GLY and optimize translation: it informs cellular origins of key targetable and measurable
contusion expansion pathways. The central hypothesis is that a subset of quantifiable cell-type specific
differentially expressed genes, pathways and proteins targeted by GLY identify risk for TBI contusion expansion.
Aim 1 demonstrates that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SC transcriptomic signatures endotype GLY-targeted
contusion expansion in humans. Aim 2 demonstrates that contusion expansion is preceded by GLY-targetable
protein biomarkers changes. The aims are synergistic: cell-type differential gene expression (Aim 1) informs
likely sources of measurable CSF biomarkers (Aim 2) of contusion expansion. The work is feasible given exciting
pilot data, an existing TBI biobank, an established multidisciplinary team and bioinformatic pipelines. It is
innovative as it shifts a guideline-based approach to precision medicine, creates a first-in-human atlas of CSF
SC response in TBI, and identifies contusion expansion biomarkers in pathways targeted by a drug being tested
in human TBI. The expected impact includes molecular endotype-based risk-stratification and enriched patient-
selection for GLY trials (high risk, pharmacodynamic response). Unique cellular components that drive contusion
expansion combined with early clinically measurable CSF biomarkers can guide unprecedented cell- and target-
precise therapy including novel (preventive) druggable targets. This lays the foundation for a paradigm shifting
SC-based precision medicine approach to understand, monitor, and treat a devastating secondary injury in TBI."
10837082,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuroinflammation
associated with amyloid plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles in the brain as well as severe
neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation and lipid accumulation. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype is by far
the most powerful genetic risk factor for late-onset AD and is thought to play an important role in
neuroinflammation and lipid metabolism. Pathological activation of microglia and astrocytes contribute
substantially to the loss of neurons and synapses and lipid dysfunction in AD and related dementias (ADRD).
Despite an important pathogenic role for microglia in tau-mediated neurodegeneration, the specific microglial
mediators of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are poorly understood. Our lab has recently
demonstrated that the microglial immune-oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) augments the production of
the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1b, in an APOE-isoform dependent manner (E4>E3). Cholesterol 25-
hydroxylase (CH25H), the enzyme that synthesizes 25HC is upregulated in AD and PS19 brain tissue as well
as in disease-associated microglia (DAM). We have preliminary evidence that 25HC directly contributes to the
age-dependent neurodegeneration observed in PS19 mice and regulates cholesterol metabolism in astrocytes.
We hypothesize that 25HC synthesized and secreted by activated microglia drives tau-dependent
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration via its effects in regulating cholesterol metabolism. We will test this
hypothesis as follows – In Aim 1, we will determine the importance of Ch25h in mediating tau-dependent
neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of Ch25h/25HC in mediating
the deleterious effects of APOE4 on tau-dependent neuropathology. In Aim 3, we will determine whether and
how 25HC alters cholesterol metabolism to reduce neuronal viability. Successful completion of this project may
enable the development of novel therapeutic strategies towards ADRD."
10767348,"For many RNA virus infections, an initial acute infection can transition to a prolonged or persistent
infection, in which infected cells survive and continue to produce progeny virus. Complement (C’) is a
powerful innate immune system which can directly lyse virus-infected cells or neutralize virus (1-4), but
the role of C’ in controlling persistent respiratory RNA virus infections is not well understood. Given that
viruses have mechanisms to block C’-mediated cell lysis, persistent infections can set up a prolonged
inflammation cycle – where activated C’ continues to provide damaging inflammation, but viral inhibitory
mechanisms block elimination of pathogen and infected cells.
 This project emerged from our striking findings that during an initial acute infection of human lung
cells with the Rubulavirus Parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), infected cells are very sensitive to C’-mediated
lysis. Importantly however, after transitioning to a persistent infection, PIV5-infected cells are nearly
completely resistant to C’ lysis. Our transcriptomics data show that PIV5 acutely infected cells have low
level expression of C’ inhibitors, but this shifts to high level expression of cellular C’ inhibitors Factor H,
Factor I, Vitronectin and Clusterin in persistently infected cells.
 Our central hypothesis is that PIV5 persistently infected cells acquire resistance to C’-mediated
lysis due to their acquired ability to express high levels of C’ inhibitors Factor H and Vitronectin. Our
goals are to identify: 1) the mechanisms for acquiring C’ resistance during the PIV5 acute-to-persistent
transition (Aim 1), and 2) consequences of this shift for production of C’-resistant virus (Aim 2).
 Aim 1 will define the mechanism for differential sensitivity of airway cells to C’-mediated lysis
during transition from acute to persistent infection. Engineered respiratory tract cell lines and primary
tracheal or bronchial air-liquid interface (ALI) cell cultures will be used to test the hypothesis that
synthesis of C’ inhibitors Factor H and Vitronectin by persistently infected cells results in conditioning of
the cells to be resistant to C’-mediated lysis. Aim 2 will identify C’ factors associated with virus particles
derived from acute versus persistently infected cells and define the sensitivity of persistent virus to C’-
mediated neutralization. Proteomics and biochemical assays will test the hypothesis that virus derived
from persistently infected cells will be C’-resistant due to recruitment of Factor H or Vitronectin.
 Results from our work on C’ interactions with persistent RNA virus infections will have strong
potential to inform therapeutics, given: 1) the clinical impact of prolonged viral respiratory infections, 2)
polymorphisms in C’ genes can correlate with severity of viral infections, and 3) clinical trials for
respiratory tract infections are underway with drugs that modulate C’ responses."

Our research program aims to directly probe how the complexity of living bacterial membranes impacts the
adsorption, transport, and domain association of small molecules, including antibiotics. To address these
points, we will leverage nonlinear spectroscopy and microscopy techniques, speciﬁcally second harmonic
generation, to map the dynamic behavior. A key to our methodology is the ability to conduct the proposed
experiments on living cells instead of model systems. For the next 5 years, our program goals are to
(1) extract the key factors that inﬂuence the adsorption and membrane organization of small molecule
membrane probes, (2) quantitatively assess the adsorption of tetracycline antibiotics and manipulate their
movement within and through the membranes of different species of bacteria, and (3) examine the spatial
dependence of small molecule-membrane interactions on individual bacteria as well as within bioﬁlms.
Together these studies will elucidate the role of how parameters including curvature, membrane domains,

Transgender adults in the U.S. are disproportionately affected by tobacco use. Transgender adults are more
than twice as likely to smoke cigarettes than the general U.S. adult population. In addition to the great burden
of disease tobacco use places onto this population, tobacco use is also a contraindication for gender-affirming
care, a medical necessity for many transgender persons to achieve full mental and physical health. Despite the
health-related needs of transgender adults, existing smoking cessation interventions fail to address the specific
needs of this population. As such, the National Academy of Medicine and U.S. Surgeon General identifies
transgender-specific health needs and developing and testing the effectiveness of interventions for
transgender adults a national priority. Despite the role health care providers can play in cessation, transgender
adults report barriers to accessing evidence-based, clinician-delivered interventions. A transgender-specific
mHealth intervention could serve as a cost-effective and scalable solutions to improving health outcomes for
this often hard-to-reach population. Furthermore, such an intervention can be a health services resource for
health care providers who might not have the time or expertise to provide gender affirming smoking cessation
support to their transgender patients. Building on our team's research expertise in transgender health,
mHealth, tobacco cessation, and health systems tobacco-related care, we propose to develop and pilot test an
mHealth smoking cessation intervention for transgender adults: Proud to Quit (P2Q). P2Q will provide tailored
messages, peer social support, and self-monitoring features. We will develop P2Q by collaborating with an
Intervention Advisory Workgroup comprising of transgender adults and providers of gender affirming health
care, and implement iterative intervention design processes and usability testing. Through a remote pilot
randomized controlled trial, we will assess acceptability and feasibility of an mHealth smoking-cessation
intervention for transgender adults as well as its preliminary efficacy using self-report and objective biomarker
data. The findings from this proposal will inform the feasibility of and protocols for a full-scale services research
effectiveness trial. The project would redress the dearth of smoking-cessation interventions tailored to
transgender adults by offering a new tool and the ability to reach transgender adults in diverse locations; it
would offer a cost-effective approach that ensures the intervention can be broadly disseminated with fidelity;
and, ultimately, it would reduce tobacco-related health disparities among transgender adults, who are
disproportionately affected by tobacco use."
10914641,"Background: The time following discharge from psychiatric hospitalization is a high-risk period and has been
associated with a range of negative outcomes, including high rates of hospital readmission and suicide (1).
Because the evidence for transitional discharge interventions with bridging components is mixed and limited in
terms of how Peer Specialists (PS) can help support such interventions, additional research is needed. Our
proposal calls for the development and preliminary evaluation of a PS facilitated technology-supported
intervention based on the existing and frequently used My Recovery Plan program. However, to date, no
studies have examined use of this tool to improve post-hospital discharge outcomes. Given the importance of
the problem for the VA, and the fact that the VA has both a large PS infrastructure that is valued by both
professional providers and Veterans, our work offers sound justification and the unique opportunity to test the
proposed intervention in a single integrated system of inpatient and outpatient services.
Significance: The significance of this project lies in its ability to actively address an important gap in the
research, namely PS interventions focused on reducing readmission and supporting recovery-oriented
outcomes in Veterans. Further relating to important HSR&D priorities the project is designed to advance
scientific knowledge and clinical practice in the areas of access to care, mental health, and suicide prevention.
Innovation and Impact: A key innovation of the proposed research is the potential to efficiently optimize existing
resources to target the widespread challenges associated with transitioning out of acute inpatient settings and
effectively connect Veterans to preferred services (in this case peer support) in order to prevent re-admission,
and improve utilization of VA outpatient mental health services. Finally, in relationship to impact, Recovery
Bridge has potential to result in improvement across multiple clinical and functional outcomes that are
applicable to a broad Veteran population (rather than only in small select diagnostically specific
subpopulations).
Specific Aim 1: Integrate the My Recovery Plan tool and existing PS tools and strategies to develop a
manualized intervention called Recovery Bridge for use by VA PS working to help Veterans make the transition
from acute inpatient psychiatric hospitalization to community living.
Specific Aim 2: Complete an open pilot trial (n=15) to examine the feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability of the
Recovery Bridge intervention in relation to well specified benchmarks supporting continued and expanded
investigation.
[Specific Aim 3: As part of the open pilot trial: 1) explore the impact of the intervention on readmission rates
(at 30 and 90 days), and connection to outpatient care compared to a control group (n=15) identified from
administrative data, and; 2) explore the change in recovery and Quality of Life measures over time in the
intervention participants].
Methodology: Source documents described in the proposal will be used to create the Recovery Bridge
intervention (as Specified in Aim 1). Quantitative, qualitative, and administrative services data we will be used
to complete an open trial of the intervention (as specified in Aim 2 and Aim 3).
Next Steps: Benchmarks across the domains of feasibility, fidelity, and acceptability; as well as exploratory
outcomes specified in Aim 3, will be used to inform next steps including a larger effectiveness trial followed by
a possible hybrid-I effectiveness/implementation trial to inform future dissemination and implementation of the
intervention more broadly across the VA."
10823239,"This R01 application focuses on the mechanisms that control the generation of very low density lipoproteins
(VLDLs) in liver cells. Prior work from the MPIs, which has resulted in 15 publications, established that a major
mechanism controlling the secretion and circulation of VLDL is the regulated degradation of apolipoprotein
(apoB) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This metabolically orchestrated event requires the ER-associated
degradation (ERAD) pathway, which was named and first elucidated by MPI Brodsky. In contrast, when neutral
lipids (primarily triacylglycerols; TGs) are sufficient, apoB is co-translationally lipidated by MTP, and the nascent
VLDL particles are expanded by lipids sourced from ER-resident lipid droplets (LDs). The re-modelled VLDL
particles are next packaged into COPII vesicles for delivery to the Golgi and then secreted into the medium from
hepatic cells (in vitro) or from liver hepatocytes into the circulation (in vivo). In contrast to these pathways that
control the levels of VLDL, the factors that regulate the concentration and composition of lipids assembled onto
apoB in the ER are poorly characterized. However, recent results generated by the MPIs and colleagues indicate
that an ER-resident membrane protein, FIT2, plays a significant role in controlling TG assembly onto apoB in
vitro and in vivo. Specifically, the preliminary data outlined in this application—which were made possible by the
generation of novel rodent models and engineered VLDL secreting cell lines—strongly suggest that FIT2
regulates both the concentration and composition of apoB-associated lipids, as well as the atherogenicity of
VLDL. Based on these and other new data, the following hypotheses will be tested: 1) FIT2 deficiency will
increase ER membrane lipid content along with the generation of TG-depleted VLDL; 2) FIT2 delivers LDs into
the ER, which are then integrated into VLDL particles in either an MTP-dependent or independent manner; and,
3) the level of FIT2 activity is a previously unappreciated determinant for the severity of fatty liver disease
(NAFLD), steatohepatitis (NASH), and atherosclerosis.
 Because the efficiency of FIT2-mediated loading of TG onto VLDL also impacts hepatic lipid levels in the ER,
FIT2 deficiency may also lead to lipid dysregulation in the ER and toxic stress responses. Moreover, the delivery
of lipid-rich VLDLs could be limited by another ER-associated factor, KLHL12, that helps form specialized VLDL-
resident COPII vesicles. Thus, another hypothesis is that native KLHL12 levels constrain the capacity of FIT2-
supported delivery of VLDL from hepatic cells, thus exacerbating ER stress. Overall, besides dissecting how
FIT2 regulates NASH, NAFLD, VLDL biogenesis, hepatic TG homeostasis, and lipoprotein atherogenicity, the
clinical relevance of this project also includes the integration of transcriptomic data from the recently generated
models with analogous databases obtained from human livers and atherosclerotic plaques. Toward all of these
goals, the project benefits from deep and complementary expertise of the MPIs along with the experience of
long-term collaborators with a substantial track record in studying lipoprotein metabolism."
10891606,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
We are entering an era of precision medicine for cancer screening in which screening initiation and
maintenance is based on personal risk estimates that incorporate multiple risk factors, with the goal of
maximizing screening benefits and minimizing the harms. One increasingly common clinical application
involves using cancer risk prediction models to inform which patients are screened, how often they are
screened, and at which ages screening occurs (i.e., risk-based screening). For breast cancer screening with
mammography, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends informed choice about when to begin
regular screening for women age 40-49. Making an informed choice means determining whether, for an
individual woman, the likelihood of receiving a screening benefit outweighs the likelihood of harms such as
false positive results and overdiagnosis. A critical component of informed choice is a woman’s personal cancer
risk, because the expected benefit of screening depends on a woman’s personal risk of breast cancer, with
women at lower risk being less likely to benefit and more likely to be harmed than women at higher risk.
Hence, incorporating informed choice into the mammography screening decision-making process means that
women are asked to make decisions about screening based on their personalized breast cancer risk
estimates. However, a critical barrier to implementing guideline-recommended informed choice in
mammograpy screening is that many people reject that their risk estimate is true for them personally, a
phenomenon we refer to as risk rejection. While previous research has focused on risk comprehension as a
high-impact target for improving medical decisions, we argue that risk rejection is also a high impact target for
improving health decision making because people who reject their risk are unlikely to make health decisions
based on that risk estimate, even when they comprehend the estimate. An estimated 1-in-4 women believe
that their breast cancer risk estimate is not accurate for them, and little is known about why, or the implications
for screening decisions. In Aim 1, we will use a longitudinal survey to understand the scientific nature of risk
rejection. Aim 1a will identify key demographic and psychological predictors of risk rejection. In particular, we
will test 4 theory-informed hypotheses about why people reject their risk: motivated reasoning, prior
knowledge, distrust, and lack of perceived personal relevance. Aim 1b will identify the impact of risk rejection
on risk-concordant screening behavior. In Aim 2, we will conduct interviews and use experiments to identify
communication strategies to reduce risk rejection. These studies will provide a comprehensive understanding
of a phenomenon – risk rejection – which, if not addressed, will impede the implementation of informed patient
choice in breast cancer screening and personalized, risk-based medicine more broadly."
10834835,"ABSTRACT: Neural networks orchestrate behavior across multiple timescales and are disordered in numerous
developmental, neurological, and psychiatric disorders. Here we use intracranial EEG recording in humans
(iEEG) to address the role of slow brain network fluctuations (SBNFs) and local cortical activation in the neural
circuits supporting external attention and attention to our internal thoughts. Notably, attention to inner thoughts
occupies up to fifty percent of our awake time but has received considerably less research focus which we will
address in the Conte Center. We focus on differential interactions between the default mode network (DMN)
and the fronto-parietal attention networks (FPCN) in support of these two core attention states. Local neural
activation is measured with broadband high frequency activity (BHA; 70-200 Hz) and single-unit activity (SUA).
Inter-areal network interactions are assessed using connectivity metrics including phase slope index, single-
trial HFA onsets, Granger causality, directional phase amplitude coupling, representational similarity and
mutual information. To examine slow fluctuations of internally versus externally directed attention across
temporal and cognitive scales, we start with well-controlled paradigms and systematically increase
experimental naturalism across three AIMS. AIM 1 employs structured tasks including switching between
external and internal attention states with a focus on the role of anterior insula and posterior cingulate in
switching. An intermodal auditory-visual attention task probes attention and lapses. In another condition we
deliver the same intermodal streams while the subject paces and slows down breaths to increase vagal
afferent firing, providing iEEG evidence of interoception and its effects on attention networks. AIM 2 uses a
more naturalistic paradigm entailing passive viewing of movies. EOMs, alpha oscillations, BHA and
pupillometry indexes drifts away from active attention to internal thought. We use a post-movie recognition task
to confirm lapses of external attention to the movies and assess the changes in the properties of interactions
between the DMN and FPCNa and FPCNb networks. AIM 3 uses experience sampling coupled with
continuous iEEG recording across multiple days. Subjects are queried about their internal mental state (on-
task: reading a book, talking to a family member or health provider) or off-task and mind-wandering as further
determined by the behavioral metrics also used in P1. This task provides a powerful test of the networks
supporting external versus internal attention in the most naturalistic environment one can achieve in an
epilepsy monitoring unit. During internal thought we assess freely moving thoughts that drift from one topic to
another, deliberately constrained thoughts focusing on an overarching goal, and automatically constrained
thoughts drawn to personally or affectively salient topics. Our findings coupled with the EEG and fMRI results
in P1 and the macaque data in P3 will improve our understanding of how SBNFs underpin and support both
normal cognition and disordered attention in neuropsychiatric disorders."
10834836,"ABSTRACT: The overarching goal of Project (P) 3 is subsumed under Center Aim 3: Advance the
physiological interpretation of macroscale findings using meso- and microscale measures in humans and
NHPs. To do so, P3 will rely on NHPs as an animal model system to inform the interpretation of human
macroscale neuroimaging (P1) and mesoscale intracranial recording studies (P2) and the biophysical modeling
(P4). NHP work will provide, 1) simultaneous scalp EEG/fMRI, behavioral-cognitive and autonomic data under
three common tasks and conditions: intermodal attention, movie watching and rest, 2) brush and laminar array
recordings to define the microscopic cell circuits and physiological processes, and 3) targets for chemogenetic
manipulation. Aim 1 will link the macroscale measures of P1 meso- and microscale physiology of slow brain
network fluctuations (SBNFs), by defining SBNFs across distributed brain areas, including both the
interoceptive system and a classic exteroceptive system, the thalamocortical auditory system. Proposed
studies will include simultaneous recordings from multiple sites within and across task positive and task
negative networks. This will allow testing the hypothesis that SBNFs entail opposing unit and LFP activation
levels in task positive and task negative networks, with the anterior insular cortex a key site associated with
SBNF network switching from ‘restive’ to more task engaged activation patterns. Aim 2 will define processes
and structures triggering and modulating SBNF dynamics. Here, we will first pharmacologically increase
arousal via Methylphenidate as a direct link to human studies in P1. We will also electrically stimulate the
Vagus Nerve which impacts on neural networks including cholinergic and dopaminergic system and the
interoceptive system. Finally, after initial range-finding studies using electrical µ-stimulation, we will conduct
reversible chemogenetic inactivation of anterior insular cortex (AIC) projections to the anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC) and nucleus basalis (NB) to test hypotheses on the roles of these pathways in control of SBNF
dynamics. P3 will provide crucial information from neurophysiological neuronal recordings to EEG and fMRI
informing the detailed cell-circuit and network modeling in P4 and the human studies in P1 and P2."
10834837,"ABSTRACT: The overarching goal of Project 4 is subsumed under Center Aim 3: Develop iterative
interactions between modeling and empirical studies to integrate knowledge across data scales. To do
so, Project 4 will develop novel computational models of neural circuit dynamics and apply them to fit features
of multi-modal neural recordings in Projects 1-3. Models will be used to test hypotheses and gain insight into
dynamical and biophysical mechanisms underlying slow brain network fluctuations (SBNFs) and their impact
on local circuit processing of sensory information. Aim 1 will fit a dynamical systems model to capture the
dynamics of spectral states in a cortical region, as measured by LFP, EEG, and iEEG. In addition, these
regional models will be interconnected in a large-scale network model to simulate brain wide dynamical
phenomena as measured by fMRI, such as functional connectivity and CAP states. We will test the specific
hypotheses that slow (~0.1-1 Hz) fluctuations in spectral state can be captured through bistability with
transitions induced by noise and adaptation, that even slower fluctuations (e.g, in arousal, or internal vs.
external attention) can be captured by shifts between bistable and monostable dynamical regimes, and that
these dynamics can account for spatiotemporal effects observed in fMRI. Aim 2 will develop biophysically
detailed models of neocortical circuits with laminar resolution specifically designed to bring macroscale human
iEEG/EEG to microscale cellular and circuit-level phenomena (cell spiking, LFP/CSD). Detailed models will be
applied to study mechanisms of slow fluctuations in a small number key circuits that are the target of study in
NHP in Project 3. We will systematically explore the manner in which cell type-specific properties, and layer
specific thalamocortical and cortical connectivity, must be combined to replicate the multiscale dynamics
revealed by NHP studies. We will test the specific hypothesis that patterns of exogenous drive together with
cell-type-specific neuromodulation of channel conductances can induce slow fluctuations in circuit activity that
translates across electrophysiological scales and species from cell activity up to EEG. We will also
characterize how ongoing slow fluctuations impact circuit responses to bottom-up sensory evoked signals,
linking slow neural dynamics to task performance. Exploratory Aim 3 will develop a multi-scale model to
explore the interplay between microcircuit and large-scale network dynamics. Specifically, we will embed the
biophysically detailed microcircuit models from Aim 2 as distinct nodes in a large-scale network in which the
other nodes are simulated as phenomenological dynamical systems from Aim 1. Collectively, the aims of
Project 4 will synthesize multi-modal recordings from Project 1-3 to develop multi-scale mechanistic

10834838,"ABSTRACT: This Conte Center proposal seeks to elucidate the role of slow brain network fluctuations
(SBNFs) across species and scales, and to establish computational models of neural circuit dynamics that
characterize SBNFs. Data collected in Projects 1-3 will span multiple modalities (EEG, fMRI, ECoG/LFP, and
single-unit recordings) and species (humans and nonhuman primates). The overarching goal of the Multimodal
Data Analysis & Integration Core (Core-B) is to address the challenge of integrating data across these multiple
modalities and analyses. To achieve this goal, Core-B will apply and develop multimodal alignment
frameworks that establish a common space for analysis across modalities, individuals, and species (to be used
in Projects 1-3), as well as integrate these data to facilitate computational modeling of neural dynamics (to be
used in Project 4). Aim 1 will leverage the functional alignment framework to construct a common space for
different modalities within- and between-subjects. Aim 2 will refine the cross-species alignment using the
functional data from the common tasks to provide the spatial transformation to link human data in Projects 1-2
and macaque data in Project 3. In addition to optimizing cross-modal and cross-species alignment, Aim 3 will
construct a framework for decomposing brain dynamics into spatiotemporal states and state-transitions derived
jointly from EEG, fMRI, and physiological signals. We will also leverage the cross-species transformation
between humans and macaques in Aim 2 to delineate the matched states across species and characterize the
species-specific temporal configurations. This framework will provide a state-space in which brain dynamics
and their causal properties can be interrogated across individuals and species. The alignment approach and
aligned data generated by this Core will be applied to the curated, quality-checked outputs received from Core
C after appropriate preprocessing (determined by domain experts from the individual Projects) and will be
distributed to Projects 1-4."
10829480,"Project Summary
Vocal hyperfunction (VH) is a highly prevalent feature in the 3 – 9% of the U.S. population with voice disorders.
Characterized by excessive and/or incoordinated laryngeal and perilaryngeal tension, its pathophysiology has
been attributed to many potential etiologies, such as poor vocal hygiene, psychological factors, reflux, and
atypical autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. Our central hypothesis, supported by our recent findings, is
that auditory-motor function is impaired in some individuals with VH: we found impairments in speakers' auditory
acuity to differences in recordings of their own voice fundamental frequency (fo) and their adaptive responses to
artificial shifts in their own voice fo. In this cycle we propose to further elucidate the etiologic role of disrupted
auditory-motor function in VH and to evaluate measures of auditory-motor function that have clinical applicability.
In Aim 1, individuals with VH and controls will participate in tasks to derive fo adaptive responses with and without
a simultaneous cognitive stressor to elicit ANS arousal. Converging evidence suggests that atypical ANS function
is a potential etiologic factor in VH, and that the level of ANS arousal may be associated with impairments in
auditory-motor function. Thus, we will directly assess whether disrupted ANS and auditory-motor function
represent a shared endophenotype (related predisposing factors) in the etiology of VH. In Aim 2, fo acuity and
adaptive responses will be investigated longitudinally in VH. Our pilot data indicate that many individuals with
VH and atypical auditory-motor features show improvement in their adaptive responses immediately after voice
therapy. This may represent normalization of an underlying etiologic factor. Conversely, voice therapy may
provide strategies to improve vocal quality, without addressing the underlying neural vulnerability of individuals
to develop VH, with changes in auditory-motor adaptation that are secondary. We anticipate that individuals with
atypical auditory-motor features immediately post-therapy will have poorer long-term responses to therapy, with
the implication that disrupted auditory-motor control is an etiologic factor in the development and persistence of
VH. The fo perturbation methods employed in Aim 1 and Aim 2 require precise calibration of instrumentation and
well-controlled acoustic environments, limiting their clinical viability. Therefore, in Aim 3, potential “clinic-friendly”
correlates (auditory acuity to shifts in the fo of a standard voice and production of speech before, during, and
after being exposed to a noisy environment to induce a Lombard response) will be psychometrically evaluated
in terms of their concurrent validity and test-retest reliability. Successful completion of these Aims will provide
theoretical and clinical insight, contributing directly to all Center Aims: delineation of the etiology and
pathophysiology of VH, more specific phenotyping of VH, and improved methods for prevention, diagnosis, and
treatment of VH. This understanding could allow for assessments that are sensitive to each patient's specific
endophenotype, allowing personalized therapy approaches based on underlying mechanisms."
10829485,"Project Summary/Abstract
Vocal hyperfunction (VH) refers to chronic conditions resulting from repeated detrimental patterns of vocal
behavior and it is implicated in the most commonly occurring types of voice disorders. Our center aims to
address the pressing need to increase the understanding of the etiological and pathophysiological mechanisms
associated with VH, to improve the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of VH-related disorders. Building upon
the progress made by our group to determine key underlying physical mechanisms, additional efforts are
needed to better understand the role of auditory-motor impairments in VH as well as the physical mechanisms
underpinning long-term of voice use in phonotrauma. Identifying what triggers a VH vicious cycle and
differentiating cause from reaction in these disorders is critical.
The first aim of the project is to determine the role of auditory-motor control in the laryngeal biomechanics of
individuals with VH. A set of lumped and finite element vocal fold models will be incorporated into an
established neurocomputational framework of speech motor control, to investigate neural control of voice in
terms of pitch, responses to environmental noise, and voice quality. Previous efforts to simulate onset and
compensatory mechanisms of VH will be extended to account for the proposed physiologically relevant
auditory-motor control model and subject-specific representations will be developed using a Bayesian
framework. The proposed auditory-motor framework will allow for the investigation of causal effects and the
interrelation between laryngeal motor control and laryngeal biomechanics, which are not directly observable
from the behavioral responses.
The second aim is to determine the physical mechanisms that underlie VH statistical classifiers that are based
on ambulatory voice monitoring. Our lumped element, finite element, and physical models will be used to
ascertain how the VH mechanisms modeled for sustained phonation relate to the long-term differences
between groups and conditions. In addition, numerical models will mimic population distributions in the
ambulatory data to determine the underlying physical mechanisms behind the statistical classification of VH.
We will also explore the role of energy dissipation dose, edema, fibrosis, and healing using structure
remodeling principles in both physical and finite element models. Individual descriptions will be enhanced using
Bayesian subject-specific model-based ambulatory measures that capture underlying VH pathophysiological
mechanisms to assess our findings for the statistical classification of VH. Completion of the proposed aim will
improve the understanding and clinical relevance of ambulatory monitoring."
10829486,"Project Summary
Vocal hyperfunction (VH) is ostensibly caused by and/or associated with pathological daily voice use and
involves the most commonly treated voice disorders by speech-language pathologists, e.g., vocal fold nodules,
muscle tension dysphonia. Voice therapy is the primary curative option for VH. For example, even when
patients undergo laryngeal surgery to remove lesions, they are still thought to be at risk for recurrence unless
they successfully complete post-surgical voice therapy. However, voice therapy suffers from high rates of
patient dropout. Patients and clinicians report that generalizing desired vocal behaviors from the therapy
session into daily life is one of the most significant barriers to successful voice therapy. Despite this critical
barrier, voice therapy remains entirely dependent upon episodic delivery within an in-clinic or virtual session.
Thus, this project will test if adding Ambulatory Voice Monitoring with Biofeedback (AVM-B) significantly
addresses this generalization challenge, as it can directly extend therapeutic activities into the patient’s daily
life. A clinical trial will randomize patients with VH to receive an evidence-based therapy (Conversation
Training Therapy; CTT) or CTT with AVM-B added. In Aim 1, it is hypothesized that, compared to patients who
only received CTT, patients who receive CTT and AVM-B will demonstrate significantly better generalization
during therapy which will be retained immediately after therapy and six months later. In Aim 2, we will explore
patient factors that mediate the relationship between therapy and generalization, hypothesizing that
stimulabilty—how easily a patient can modify their voice—and engagement—the patient’s level of effort during
therapy—will be positively correlated to the amount of generalization in daily life. If successful, this work would
result in multiple paradigm-shifting impacts with potential to improve the efficiency of clinical practice. AVM-B
would become one of the first evidence-based voice treatment activities taking place primarily outside the
therapy session. Future work could investigate how AVM-B could transition voice therapy from once-a-week
sessions into a continuous process integrated into the patient’s daily life. Further inquiry could improve
generalization by identifying evidence-based methods to tailor therapy based on individual patient factors such
as stimulability and engagement. After discharge, AVM-B could provide a means for patients to “recalibrate”
themselves and prevent relapse without having to see a clinician. Finally, implementation work could help
clinicians adopt/adapt AVM-B and evaluate its effects on dropouts."
10862883,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mucins are densely O-glycosylated proteins with extended regions of clustered Ser/Thr-linked O-glycans, a
structural feature that imparts a rigid and extended conformation. Their range of biological functions include
physical stiffening of the glycocalyx to modulate cell survival in low adhesion settings, and biochemical
interactions with glycan-binding receptors on other cells. Altered mucin expression and glycosylation patterns
have been strongly linked to cancer progression. Crude measurements of these changes are currently used for
cancer diagnosis but are imperfect due to their lack of molecular-level detail. A detailed map of mucin O-glycan
structures and sites has been impossible to obtain, as mucins are recalcitrant to conventional mass
spectrometry-based glycoproteomics methods. As a consequence, the cellular pathways underlying aberrant
mucin structures are not well defined. We are pursuing these questions with the long-term goal of identifying
more accurate cancer biomarkers and new therapeutic targets.
During the previous funding period, we developed new mass spectrometry-based glycoproteomics methods and
used them in fundamental studies of the enzymes that initiate mucin-type O-glycosylation, the polypeptide
GalNAc transferases. Examples of our accomplishments include (i) development of the IsoTaG method for intact
glycoproteomics via isotopic recoding and mass-independent glycopeptide discovery; (ii) identification of an
optimal tandem mass spectrometry method for O-glycosite discovery; and (iii) development of a bump/hole
strategy to identify biological substrates of polypeptide GalNAc transferases that initiate mucin-type O-
glycosylation. In preliminary work for this application, we repurposed mucin-specific proteases (“mucinases”)
from gut-resident microbes as tools for mapping O-glycosites on mucin domains.
In the next funding period, we plan to develop a comprehensive “mucinomics” platform. We will use engineered
mucinases as glycoform-sensitive probes of mucin expression on cells and tissues. We will also develop a
mucinase-based enrichment strategy for mass spectrometry-based discovery of new mucin domain molecules
as well as O-glycosite mapping. Integrated into this workflow will be newly developed ionization methods and
search algorithms for O-glycosite identification. Finally, we will use the mucinomics platform to define pathways
by which prevalent oncogenes drive altered mucin expression and glycosylation in cancer."
10850846,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) are powerful high-throughput
techniques for studying transcriptome variation at population and single-cell scales. Many computational
methods have been developed for analyzing bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data. However, there remain multiple
challenges in identifying disease/trait-associated genes from population-scale bulk RNA-seq data, studying
temporal transcriptome dynamics from scRNA-seq data, and benchmarking scRNA-seq computational tools. In
our proposed research, we will develop statistical methods to address these challenges and elucidate regulatory
mechanisms of transcriptome variation at population and single-cell scales. At the population scale, we will
develop a unified statistical framework for identifying associations between genotypes and RNA isoform
abundances, the “ideal” RNA-level molecular phenotypes. Our framework will unify existing diverse approaches
that focus on specific aspects of transcript variation (e.g., gene expression, alternative exon/intron usage, and
alternative polyadenylation) and, for the first time, incorporate the uncertainty in estimating isoform abundances.
As a result, our framework should improve the accuracy and power in detecting associations between genetic
variants and genes. We will make our framework applicable to all second- and third-generation RNA-seq data
and apply it to the GTEx data, the most comprehensive genotype-transcriptome database, to discover genes
that are associated with the disease/trait-associated variants found by GWAS. At the single-cell scale, we will
develop three methods: 1) a valid statistical test for detecting temporally differentially expressed genes from
scRNA-seq data while accounting for the uncertainty in trajectory inference, 2) a clustering method that
integrates mechanistic and statistical modeling for identifying cell subpopulations along a temporal process, and
3) a comprehensive and interpretable simulator that generates realistic scRNA-seq data for benchmarking
computational tools. The first two methods will offer much-in-demand solutions to temporal gene expression
analysis of scRNA-seq data. Their applications will include the study of macrophage transcriptome changes
during immune responses. The third method will be the first scalable and transparent simulator that captures
gene correlations and allows the tuning of experimental parameters, including cell numbers and library sizes.
Overall, we expect that our proposed methods will significantly improve the power, robustness, and
reproducibility of studying transcriptome variation from bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data."

10862773,"Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) has disabled millions of people world-wide. Individual risk for NIHL
varies from person to person under similar exposure conditions, suggesting that genetic factors contribute to
susceptibility. We have found that mice lacking a transcription factor called FOXO3 become severely and
permanently deafened after a noise exposure that only briefly affects their wild-type littermates. FOXO3 has
multiple functions in other cell types, including oxidative stress reduction, autophagy, and directly inducing
apoptosis. A recent study linked human genetic variations in FOXO3 to a greater susceptibility to occupational
NIHL. However, the FOXO3 alleles associated with NIHL drive increased expression of FOXO3. Thus, there
is evidence to indicate that FOXO3 is important for hearing preservation, but there is also evidence that excess
FOXO3 drives NIHL. In this grant, we seek to address this knowledge gap by researching the mechanisms of
FOXO3 function, using translatome sequencing, cell-specific Foxo3 conditional knockouts (cKO), and CRISPR
modifications to generate mouse lines that can be used to investigate the human NIHL-linked FOXO3 allele.
 In Foxo3-knockout (KO) mice, noise eliminates high-frequency outer hair cells (OHCs). We show that
this occurs through a rapid cell death program called parthanatos, which is caspase-independent apoptosis.
Parthanatos indicates that in the absence of any noise damage, Foxo3-KO OHCs are primed for death. Bulk
RNA-Seq data from control Foxo3-KO and wild-type littermates show no evidence for changes in oxidative
stress reducers known to be regulated by FOXO3. Instead, we see changes in actin binding genes expressed
in OHCs. In Aim 1, we propose to validate this screen and identify markers of OHC distress in the Foxo3-KO
through translatome sequencing. In Aim 2, we propose to make cell-specific Foxo3-cKO to identify the cells in
which FOXO3 acts. Wild-type mice express FOXO3 protein in both OHCs and in the surrounding supporting
cells (SCs). By using inducible DNA recombinases lines specific to either OHCs or SCs, we can ablate
FOXO3 function in either cell type. We will expose such Foxo3-cKO mice to noise and determine their NIHL
susceptibility. Finally, in Aim 3, we have used CRISPR genetic modification technology to create two mouse
lines, one with control sequences (Foxo3-T-allele mice), as well as one homologous to the human FOXO3
allele that confers NIHL susceptibility (Foxo3-G-allele mice). We will validate that the Foxo3-G-allele mouse
line has increased levels of FOXO3 in cochlear cells after noise exposure. We hypothesize that this
modification promotes apoptosis from FOXO3 activation, and we will test that hypothesis by exposing Foxo3-
G-allele mice to noise, measuring their hearing and analyzing potential cellular losses. In sum, through both
loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments, we will analyze FOXO3's role in hearing loss from noise."

 Cell division requires a carefully coordinated series of essential events that must be precisely regulated.
A central feature of cell division is the accurate segregation of chromosomes into daughter cells. Other
compartments of the cell must also be carefully packaged into daughter cells, and coordinated with
chromosome segregation. Membrane trafficking pathways are essential for the completion of cytokinesis at the
end of cell division. How cells control membrane trafficking during cytokinesis is not well understood. The large
protease separase is a central player in chromosome segregation due to its role in cohesin cleavage, which
allows chromosome separation at the onset of anaphase. After chromosome segregation, separase promotes
several events during anaphase. This proposal aims to understand a novel role of separase in the exocytosis
of RAB-11 vesicles required for cytokinesis. Separase also regulates exocytosis of large cortical granules
during anaphase of meiosis I to block polyspermy, which is an ideal context to analyze this regulatory pathway.
We will use biochemical and genetic approaches to identify substrates or binding partners of separase on
vesicles to define the mechanism by which it promotes exocytosis. The dynamic localization of separase is
regulated during cell division and separase only localizes to vesicles during anaphase. We will investigate how
chromosome segregation regulators control separase activity and localization to vesicles. Overexpression of
non-degradable securin will be used to determine how this inhibitory chaperone controls the exocytic function
of separase. Mutations of the PPH-5 phosphatase and its activator HSP-90 were identified as suppressors of
embryo lethality of separase mutants. Separase phosphorylation sites will be mapped and phosphorylation
mutants will be studied to determine how they affect separase function. PPH-5 will be tested to determine if it
directly dephosphorylates separase in vitro. The functions of PPH-5 and HSP-90 will be characterized to
determine whether they directly regulate separase during the meiotic divisions. These studies will be
performed using the genetically tractable C. elegans embryo. This work will provide new insight into how cells
coordinate the essential process of chromosome segregation with exocytosis during cytokinesis, which is
relevant to understanding normal development and diseases such as infertility and cancer."

available. We have recently found that NPM1c mutant leukemias depend on the histone methyltransferase MLL
and its adaptor protein Menin to maintain leukemia gene expression and proliferation. The interaction between
Menin and MLL is essential for the recruitment of the MLL complex to a subgroup of its target genes, such as
MEIS1, which are in turn essential for maintaining leukemic self-renewal. Therapeutic targeting of the Menin-
MLL interaction with small molecule inhibitors causes a loss of self-renewal and differentiation of NPM1c
leukemia cells. The link between NPM1c mutations and the MLL-complex remains to be resolved. In the
proposed project, we will develop a comprehensive understanding of the chromatin state that occurs in the
presence of NPM1c specifically focusing on the role of Menin and MLL in this process. To achieve this, we will
first determine the changes in chromatin state upon NPM1c degradation and determine essential protein
domains of NPM1c (Aim 1). Next, we will identify which transcriptional activators and chromatin modifiers
associate with the Menin-MLL complex in NPM1c mutant leukemias that lead to the aberrant target gene
activation (Aim 2). Finally, we will focus on the chromatin binding factor LEDGF, which has been shown to
associate with Menin-MLL and recruit transcriptional activators to control gene expression. Our preliminary data
suggests that LEDGF is a dependency in NPM1c mutant leukemia cells and that LEDGF loss enhances the
detrimental effects of Menin-inhibition on cell survival and MLL-target gene expression (Aim 3). In summary, the
insights gained from the proposed project will help advance our mechanistic understanding of NPM1c driven
leukemia development with the goal of improving treatment strategies in the future."

generation of physician scientists."
10840431,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over one million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) and 239,000 TB-related deaths occur in children each year.
Young children, especially those with HIV, are more likely to present with disseminated or extrapulmonary TB
and paucibacillary disease, often missed by respiratory sampling. Non-sputum, biomarker-based diagnostic tools
for rapid TB detection and treatment response in children, using easily obtained specimens are urgently needed.
Exosomes are small (30-100 nm) membranous extracellular vesicles (EVs) originating from endosomal cell
compartments; those secreted by M. tuberculosis (Mtb) or Mtb-infected macrophages appear to play a significant
role in Mtb pathogenesis. Our collaborators have developed a rapid and sensitive nanoplasmon-enhanced
scattering (nPES) assay which directly detects Mtb-exosomes (Mtb-EVs) from as little as 1 L of serum. Proof-
of-concept nPES assays performed with Mtb markers LpqH (19-kDa Mtb lipoprotein) and LAM distinguished
adult TB from at-risk patients and normal controls, and among pediatric TB cases (including HIV+) and controls
with high sensitivity and specificity.
We propose using archived specimens and clinical data from the Pediatric Urgent Start of HAART (PUSH) Study
(NCT02063880) and a new proposed prospective cohort of children suspected of TB with high HIV prevalence
to evaluate performance of nPES detected Mtb-EVs for pediatric TB diagnosis (Aim 1), treatment response (Aim
2), and evaluation of a point-of-care platform (Aim 3). In addition to assessing conventional diagnostic
performance measures, we propose to use advanced epidemiologic methods (Bayesian latent class analysis)
given the context of an imperfect reference. Additional evaluation in adult TB patients and healthy controls
including household contacts (adults and children) and recently BCG-vaccinated infants without TB is proposed.
We hypothesize nPES detected Mtb-EVs will 1) have similar diagnostic performance to the reference of
Xpert/culture among children with confirmed TB without the need for sputum, and identify additional children
missed by respiratory sample, 2) will provide a useful surrogate marker of treatment response with decline in
quantitative levels during successful treatment, and 3) will maintain performance with a point-of-care platform.
Using cryopreserved samples from a well-characterized cohort of children with HIV who underwent intensive TB
evaluation and a prospective cohort of children suspected of TB with high HIV prevalence provides opportunity
for efficient evaluation of a novel diagnostic with potential for clinical impact to improve pediatric TB diagnosis."
10913281,"Project Summary/Abstract.
The suppression of melatonin production by nighttime retinal light exposure has been linked to health risks to
nightshift workers. Blue-blocking filters can preserve nighttime melatonin levels, and monocular light exposures
can radically reduce nighttime melatonin suppression to as little as 10% of that observed for conventional
binocular exposures. Our premise is that positioning a blue-blocking orange filter over one eye will preserve
binocular vision while reducing light-induced melatonin suppression relative to a completely unfiltered viewing
condition. This solution should not impede the performance of visual tasks that might require binocular vision,
nor should it cause user discomfort. We propose a laboratory experiment (Aim 1) to determine whether blue-
blocking filters and monocular viewing, alone or in combination, are effective for maintaining melatonin at night
without affecting visual performance and subjective sleepiness (KSS). Aim 2 will be conducted at the Simulation
Teaching and Research Center (STAR) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai to determine whether
altered viewing interventions could influence melatonin levels and simulated task performance requiring depth
perception (e.g., catheter / intra venous insertion in dummy) in healthcare workers. For Aim 3, involving
nightshift working workers operating in actual hospital environments at Mount Sinai Hospital and Memorial
Hospital in South Bend, IN, we will determine whether eyewear aimed at maintaining melatonin at night would
be effective, practical, and socially acceptable. Aim 1 will employ a crossover within-subjects design, exposing
subjects to 6 experimental conditions (monocular/binocular x filtered/non-filtered, 2 controls) over the course
of 6 independent sessions. Aim 2 will employ a within-subjects design exposing subjects to 4 experimental
conditions (control, filtered binocular, filtered monocular, unfiltered monocular/dominant eye occluded) over
the course of 4 nightshifts (separated by at least a week). Aim 3 will be employ a within-subjects design similar
to Aim 2 over the course of 4 one-week sessions (at least 3 shifts per session) with salivary melatonin levels,
sleepiness scores, and Likert scale responses, as the output measures. This proposal is significant from a practical
perspective because the methods to be tested could serve as elegant, inexpensive, personalized, non-invasive
optical interventions to protect the natural synthesis of melatonin in night-shift workers. We will be addressing
Healthy Work Design and Well-being (cross-sector). As part of the Research to Practice (r2p) activity, we will
address need to maintain melatonin at night among nightshift nurses with a novel, but inexpensive technology,
and evaluate its efficacy in practice."
10820429,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a fundamental gap in our knowledge whether natural mechanisms protect high-risk children from
caries and arise from microbial interactions of commensal bacteria in the oral cavity, or from the interplay of
microbiome and tooth, mediated by saliva. The long-term goal is to prevent early childhood caries (ECC) in
North American Indigenous children through protective treatments that may also be applicable in the broader
population. The central hypothesis, based on the research team’s strong preliminary data, is that children with
and without ECC differ in one or more key drivers: i) microbially reduced acidogenicity of S. mutans, or ii)
enamel and dentin properties, composition, or biochemical fingerprint. The objective in this application is to
integrate observational and basic science, from associations to experiments that test underlying caries
protection mechanisms in children with high levels of S. mutans. The study rationale is based on strong
evidence that i) Rothia sp. actively control S. mutans acidogenesis, and ii) enamel and dentin differ in
composition between the two groups, with lead, cadmium, and sulfur lower in teeth from caries-free children
compared with the unaffected region of caries-affected teeth. The research team plans to pursue the following
three Specific Aims: Aim 1. Test whether and how Rothia and/or other oral species may mitigate the cariogenic
effects of acidogenic bacteria. Aim 2. Test whether and how tooth properties modulate the susceptibility to acid
dissolution of enamel and dentin. Aim 3. Test how tooth substrate or saliva affect acidogenicity and spatial
structure of biofilms, and whether spatial structure of biofilms grown from ex vivo dental plaque differs between
ECC-affected and CF children. The contribution is expected to achieve high impact by going beyond single-risk
factor studies to investigate caries-protective mechanisms involving microbial genetics, biofilm organization
and tooth composition. The proposed research is innovative, because we shift focus to the small percentage of
Indigenous children with high loads of S. mutans and without caries history, use state-of-the art imaging
techniques of in vitro controlled biofilm growth on standardized enamel chips, and integrate multimodal
analyses of enamel and dentin properties, biochemical fingerprint, and mineral composition. This contribution
will be significant because dental caries disproportionally affects North American Indigenous children. After
successful completion of this project, new mechanistic insights into molecular interactions and physiological
functions of commensal oral flora to reduce acid production in cariogenic species can inform new caries
preventive therapeutic strategies."
10804626,"Background: Few of the drugs Veterans take as a cornerstone to prevent and treat disease are produced
domestically; the majority of medications consumed in the U.S. are produced in foreign facilities. Thus, the drug
supply chain is global and susceptible to disruption due to unanticipated events, such as the 2019 Coronavirus
pandemic (COVID-19).
Significance: However, little is known on the frequency of drug shortages causing medication treatment gaps
and subsequent impact on adverse clinical outcomes. This is especially true in the outpatient setting, where
the majority of drug shortages occur.
Innovation and Impact: The research is innovative by conducting formative work on: 1) the impact of the pan-
demic on drug supply and outcomes, 2) differences in shortages in VA priority groups, 3) incorporating stake-
holders to inform methods, 4) direct involvement of VA operations and an expert panel of federal partners, and
[unique access to operations data.]. The majority of Rx use and drug shortages in VA occur in outpatients, but
prior research on drug shortages has focused on inpatients. We will also evaluate the impact of drug shortages
by race, ethnicity, age, location, and co-morbidities. The results obtained here will guide VA policy-makers in
the identification of the most effective policies to address this growing problem.
Specific aims: 1) Determine the impact of the COVID pandemic on the drug supply chain in VA; 2) Assess the
impact of drug shortages on outpatient medication treatment disruption in the VA; and 3) Determine the asso-
ciation between drug shortage-related treatment disruption in outpatient prescription refills and serious adverse
clinical outcomes.
Methodology: Drug supply chain issues will be identified through U.S. reporting systems (e.g., FDA). We will
leverage VA data for the quantity of drugs ordered and supplied nationally using VA purchasing and outpatient
prescription data. For each drug potentially used in the outpatient setting with a reported supply chain issue,
purchase changes will be assessed monthly pre- (2017-2019) and during the pandemic. Aim 1 will use inter-
rupted time series (ITS) analyses to test whether the incidence of supply chain issues triggering a decrease in
supply increased after pandemic start. Aim 2 will identify outpatient drug shortages leading to treatment disrup-
tion using ITS and structural break models. Aim 3 will define cohorts based on the indication for drugs with
identified shortages using a time to event analysis with entropy balance weighting to evaluate if adverse out-
comes (hospitalizations, death, emergency/urgent care) were greater for patients using drugs affected by short-
ages (the exposed group) compared to unexposed controls.
Next steps and Implementation: Dissemination will be guided by an expert panel comprised of VA operational
partners, other federal partners and experts in drug supply and shortages. The quantitative results will be as-
similated with the expert panel discussions to develop a support guide to mitigate drug shortages in VA. The
next step will be to; 1) inform the US list of essential medicines and criteria for production (e.g., domestically)
and 2) determine effectiveness of our support guide and future VA policy implemented based on our work. Our
future research will work to ensure access and equitable distribution of drugs with limited supply and/or at risk
for shortages. Even after the pandemic, the research proposed will provide results to mitigate drug shortages
which remains a crucial public health issue even in the absence of a national emergency. Thus, this will be one
step in our long-term goal to plan for future global emergencies, drug shortages at large, and inform national
policy to decrease the impact of drug shortages on patient outcomes."
11058866,"Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive and lethal form of brain cancer, is characterized by a profound
immunosuppressive microenvironment (TME) that restricts the effects of promising immunotherapies. Therefore,
there is a pressing need to develop more effective interventions to overcome this mechanism of resistance.
Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are a mixture of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and microglia
(MG), and they are instrumental for the maintenance of the immunosuppressive state of GBM. However, there
are no effective approaches to overcome the immunosuppressive activity of TAMs in GBM, mainly due to an
incomplete understanding of TAM regulatory functions. Our long term-goal is to dissect targetable metabolic and
molecular mechanisms regulating TAM functions in the context of GBM; as these discoveries will facilitate novel
therapies to target immunosuppression and improve the dismaying outcome of GBM patients. A recent study
demonstrated that TAM are major consumers of glucose and maintain a robust glucose metabolism in the TME.
However, it has not yet been determined how GBM supports the adaptation to glucose metabolism in TAMs
and the functional consequences of this adaptation also remain elusive. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress
activation is associated with the malignant progression of glioma and with the infiltration of anti-inflammatory
macrophages. PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), a critical ER stress sensor, was found to be significantly activated
in human glioma tissues, and its inhibition altered ATP/lactate production by glioma cells. Our preliminary data
expanded these findings indicating that MDM demonstrated highest glucose avidity among MG and neoplastic
cells in GBM tumors, and PERK was strongly activated in GBM infiltrating GLUT1+MDM. Contrary to MG, MDM
exhibited potent immunosuppressive activity. GLUT1+MDM were the only contributors to the suppressive activity
associated with MDM in GBM tumors. GBM-derived factors primed activation of PERK signaling in MDM, which
correlated with metabolic reprogramming resulting in high glycolysis, immunosuppressive functions, histone
lactylation, and no change in histone acetylation. Based on our crucial observations, we hypothesize that a
PERK-driven perturbation of glucose metabolism in MDM governs their immunosuppressive functions via
lactate-derived lactylation of histone lysine residues. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims:
Aim1: to elucidate underlying mechanisms of how PERK governs glycolysis in MDM in GBM tumors; Aim2:
to define glucose-driven epigenetic modifications that regulates immunosuppressive programs in MDM;
Aim3: to investigate the therapeutic potential of an epigenetic targeting approach to modulate the functions
of TAMs in GBM. The proposed studies are highly innovative because they will elucidate a previously
uncharacterized link between ER stress and glucose metabolism that regulates the activity of TAMs via
epigenetic mechanisms. Our proposal will provide a mechanistic rationale for the development of novel
therapies to target immunosuppressive TAMs and enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in GBM patients."

Cells perform mechanical tasks across a wide range of processes including segregating chromosomes during
cell division. These tasks are accomplished by the organization of force-generating cytoskeletal networks.
Micron-scale microtubule networks need both motor and non-motor proteins to move and organize filaments into
proper functional mechanical units. Our long-term goal is to decipher the mechanical code that underlies the
assembly and function of these networks, using mitosis as a model biological process. To achieve this goal, we
will employ biochemical reconstitution, biophysical methods, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, and live-
cell imaging. We will build on our recent publications and unpublished preliminary data to focus on microtubule
network mechanics in mitosis in the following three Aims: (1) Determine the mechanical and functional
differences between bridging fibers in metaphase and the central spindle microtubule network in anaphase.
Specifically, we will dissect the molecular mechanisms of an essential crosslinking non-motor MAP, PRC1, that
builds distinct motifs within the mitotic spindle. These features include bridging fibers that connect sister
kinetochore fibers in metaphase and the central spindle midzone array in anaphase. PRC1 is cell cycle regulated
by CDK/cyclin B, and therefore is a biochemically distinct molecule in metaphase and anaphase. We will
assemble and mechanically probe filament networks to understand how the spindle is able to differentially
generate forces and remodel itself while moving chromosomes in metaphase and anaphase. Imaging live cells
during mitosis that express mutant PRC1 constructs will validate our in vitro findings. (2) Determine the molecular
mechanisms for MAP clustering and the functional role of MAP clusters in regulating microtubule organization.
Specially, we will examine how intrinsically disordered subdomains within PRC1 contribute to MAP clustering.
Our published and preliminary data suggests that PRC1 clusters significantly impede filament sliding, and that
the C-terminal unstructured domain mediates this effect. We will employ our biophysical and cell biological tools
to determine the effect that reducing clustering has on microtubule organization. (3) Determine how complexes
of motor and non-motor MAPs collectively regulate microtubule organization. We will examine how the
Kif4A/PRC1 complex generates forces during microtubule sliding, and how a steady-state overlap arrangement
produces resistive forces that maintain spindle midzone integrity. Together, our findings should advance our
understanding of how micron-scale microtubule networks regulate chromosome motions in mitosis. We aim to
elucidate a ‘code’ that defines how the structure and biochemistry of different MAPs gives rise to cellular
machinery that can perform mechanical work. Errors in microtubule network assembly due to copy number
variations or mutations in essential MAPs are linked to disease in humans. Our research will shed light on the
biophysical properties that link network failure to disease states and may lead to therapies that target these
proteins or provide insights into diagnostic tools for assessing disease progression."

This proposal focuses on the design, development, and validation of a novel soft surgical robot to address critical
unmet needs within the world of lung cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in the
United States and worldwide with an estimated 1.8 million deaths a year, more than breast cancer, prostate
cancer, and colon cancer combined. Early diagnosis and therapy are essential to increase the survival rate of
lung cancer. Because approximately 70% of lung nodules reside in the deeper peripheral region of the lung,
adequate sampling of the tissue is challenging. Traditional manual bronchoscopes are limited in their ability to
access small bronchi because of large diameters. Robotic bronchoscopes available on the market are easier
and more intuitive to maneuver. However, they still present distal dexterity limitations and deep exploration is still
performed without visualization by using semi-flexible needles that are pushed manually by the clinician. This
affects biopsy accuracy and precision and ultimately diagnostic yield, causing delays in diagnosis and treatment
and increasing the risk for tumor growth and spread. In this proposal, we will leverage our prior pioneering work
on the design, fabrication, and preliminary validation of a miniaturized soft robotic bronchoscope for early-stage
lung cancer diagnosis and treatment. This air-powered, image-guided robot is the smallest and most flexible
and dexterous robotic bronchoscope, allowing navigation in branches deeper in the lung and visual feedback
throughout the procedure. The system features two separate working channels to facilitate, for the first time,
simultaneous (i.e., within the same bronchoscopy procedure) diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities and hasten
early-stage lung cancer treatment. We will optimize the soft robotic bronchoscope navigation and stabilization
control based on computer vision algorithms. We will merge pre-operative planning and intra-operative data and
evaluate accuracy and precision in registration. We will develop a mechanical stabilization system at the robot
tip, that will anchor to the surrounding anatomy and work in concert with software stabilization. This will enhance
robot lesion tracking abilities during breathing and other involuntary or accidental movements and counteract
tissue reaction forces during biopsy to improve surgical tasks’ accuracy and precision. We will enable robotic
actuation control for needle tool deployment and steering via multi-DOF soft robotic micro actuators at the robot
tip. Sharp bending angles and large strokes will enable access to hard-to-reach lesions without losing visualization.
We will validate the robot in-vitro and ex-vivo and compare metrics with standard bronchoscopy. We anticipate
our technology to have better navigational abilities, more accurate instrument placement, reduced procedure
times, less tissue trauma, better diagnostic yield, shortened learning curve, and an overall enhanced procedural
experience. Our team is uniquely positioned to achieve success of this study, possessing expertise in surgical
robotics, soft robotics, medical devices, and interventional pulmonology, and having a long history of close and
fruitful collaboration."
10828912,"Abstract
Heart failure (HF) is one of the most frequent principal diagnoses for hospitalization and a leading cause of
death in the United States. It has been estimated that up to 65% of HF hospitalizations are the results of
insufficient HF self-care. Despite clear evidence that HF self-care reduces the risk of mortality and hospital
readmissions, many HF patients struggle to take medications as prescribed, maintain a low sodium diet,
monitor their weight and HF symptoms daily, and engage in physical activity. Existing HF self-care
interventions delivered face-to-face or via telephone have had limited impact and reach because they require
significant provider time and are not always accessible to patients due to socioeconomic constraints,
geographic barriers, and other obstacles. There is a critical need for accessible and scalable interventions that
are designed to assist patients with HF self-care while in the community. Consumer mobile health (mHealth)
technologies (e.g., apps and sensor devices) hold promise for promoting HF self-care and expanding
intervention delivery. However, their efficacy remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, our team
developed a patient-centered HF self-care intervention (iCardia4HF) that combines the use of three
commercially available mobile health apps and connected health devices (MyApps) with a program of
individually tailored text messages (Text4HF) targeting modifiable behavioral factors to promote HF self-care
adherence and improve clinical outcomes. We recently completed a NIH-funded pilot randomized controlled
trial (RCT) to test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the iCardia4HF intervention over 3 months in a
predominantly minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged HF population. Results from this study provide
important feasibility and preliminary data. The next step in our program of research and purpose of the
proposed study is to conduct a fully powered, 2x2 factorial RCT to determine the independent and combined
efficacy of the two iCardia4HF intervention components (MyApps and Text4HF) at 6 months, as well as their
maintenance efficacy at 6 months post-intervention. A total of 360 HF patients with suboptimal adherence to
HF self-care will be recruited and randomized to one of four conditions for 12 months: (1) Usual care, (2)
Text4HF, (3) MyApps, or (4) MyApps&Text4HF. The primary outcome is percent of days lost due to
cardiovascular hospitalization or death for any cause. Secondary outcomes are objective measures of HF self-
care adherence (medication [MEMS], daily weighing and BP monitoring [Withings scale and BP monitor], low-
sodium diet [urinary sodium], and physical activity [accelerometer]), self-reported HF self-care, HRQL, and
major cardiac events (mortality, hospitalizations, ER visits). This study will provide important new knowledge
that will critically shape our understanding about the potential of commercially available mHealth technologies
and tailored TMs to improve HF self-care adherence and reduce hospital readmissions in patients with HF."

 Cardiometabolic (CM) diseases including cardiovascular (CV) and metabolic diseases are the leading
cause of preventable death in the United States and Worldwide. CM diseases are interconnected and positively
associated with multi-domain Cardiometabolic Risk Factors (CMRFs) such as metabolic dysregulation, obesity,
physical inactivity, poor nutrition, and other emerging factors (including and especially sleep disorders). CMRFs
are highly and increasingly prevalent in adolescents and young adults, which foreshadows a future
epidemic of incident CM diseases as they age. However, existing studies have primarily focused on the adult
and senior population with little to no knowledge on the young population.
CM data hold great promise to facilitate CM subgroup discovery for early risk stratification and precise
prognosis. However, significant gaps exist in fully leveraging CM data. Gap I: Lack of inclusion of multi-
domain CMRFs (especially sleep health). Gap II: Lack of “outcome-predictive” CM subgroups in early risk
stratification. Gap III: Lack of “subgroup-specific” precise prognosis of “multi-dimensional” CM outcomes. Gap
IV: Under-utilization of the rich but “incomplete” multi-domain CM data in NHANES and NSRR. We propose a
multi-study multi-domain secondary analysis for CM subgroup discovery and risk prediction in U.S. adolescents
(11-18) and young adults (19-39). The objective is to create 2 combined NHANES and NSRR datasets and
examine multi-domain CMRFs including metabolic dysregulation, physical inactivity, poor nutrition, and multi-
dimensional sleep measures for CM subgroup discovery and risk prediction in the large and diverse U.S.
adolescent and young adult population of Hispanics/Latinos, African Americans, Caucasians, and Asian
Americans. Aim 1. CM risk subgroup discovery at baseline for U.S. adolescents & young adults. (1.1) Develop
a novel sparse Incomplete Multi-domain Mixed-typed Factor Mixture Model (IM2-FMM) for subgroup discovery
from incomplete multi-domain mixed-typed CMRFs. (1.2) Apply IM2-FMM to identify, characterize, and evaluate
CM subgroups in adolescents and young adults from incomplete multi-domain mixed-typed CMRFs at baseline
including: (a) self-reported sleep measures in NHANES; (b) self-reported and objective sleep measures in NSRR.
Aim 2. Subgroup-specific prediction of multi-dimensional longitudinal CM outcomes for young adults. (2.1)
Develop a novel sparse Transfer Learning-based Generalized Multi-level Model (TL-GMM) to predict multi-
dimensional longitudinal CM outcomes from clustered CMRFs at baseline. (2.2) Apply TL-GMM to young adults
in NSRR to: (1) examine fixed effects and random effects of baseline CMRFs on CM outcomes; (2) provide
subgroup-specific multi-dimensional prognosis of CM health from clustered CMRFs at baseline. Impact: Our
study will generate novel insights into CM subgroup discovery to facilitate early and targeted interventions and
help establish health promoting behaviors in adolescents and young adults, eventually improving CM health care
in their transition to adulthood and reducing CM health disparities and costs as the young population ages."

 Prostate cancer (PC) remains the most common cancer affecting men in the US, resulting in both a high
number of deaths but also an even greater number of survivors experiencing treatment-related toxicities.
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a cornerstone of therapy for both locally advanced and metastatic cases,
though it results in myriad negative effects, including increased insulin resistance and incident diabetes. The
intensified androgen receptor targeted agents (ARTA), while improving overall survival, exacerbate these
negative effects. Most men with PC are older, thus at risk of, or already suffering from, comorbidities such as
diabetes and heart disease; these often represent their greatest threat to mortality.
 The ADT-induced metabolic changes may also adversely impact men at high risk of PC death by
promoting cancer progression. During ADT, insulin, leptin and IGF1 levels all increase; higher levels are linked
with more aggressive PC and may drive castration resistance. We showed in human studies that intermittent
fasting using a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) can favorably change insulin, glucose and IGF1/IGFBPs. Our FMD
trials involved patients consuming a very low-calorie plant-based FMD for 5 days while during days 6-28, patients
ate what they wanted, but were encouraged to eat per European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism
guidelines for cancer survivors. Further, we showed this approach can delay tumor progression in multiple mouse
models including PC. Based upon the above, we hypothesize that intermittent fasting using a FMD will delay PC
progression and improve metabolic health in men being treated with intensified ADT. To test this hypothesis, we
propose a three-site randomized controlled trial of an intermittent fasting intervention using a FMD vs. standard
of care for 6 months in patients with metastatic castration sensitive PC (mCSPC) starting on intensified ADT with
or without chemotherapy. For the first time, we will test the effect of FMD on improvement in PSA nadir, an early
clinical endpoint strongly correlated with better survival. We will also measure how changes in insulin and IGF1
associate with PSA nadir as one mechanism by which this dietary approach improves cancer outcomes and will
further seek to define a molecular subset of PCs which are most responsive to this diet.
 The results of this trial will have immediate impact for PC patients, both metastatic and potentially the
larger population who receive a course of ADT with definitive therapy. Thousands of men each year could be
prevented from developing or having exacerbation of diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors, which are
their greatest mortality threat, by using a FMD. For men with metastatic PC, improving tumor control and delaying
castration resistance would reduce morbidity, particularly skeletal complications, and improve survival. The PC
research community will gain insight into metabolic toxicity and hormonal pathway interactions with the next-
generation ARTA as well as identify molecular subtypes that benefit most from intermittent fasting using a FMD."

Ectopic pregnancy is the leading cause of maternity-related death during the first trimester of pregnancy.
Approximately 98 % of ectopic implantations occur in the fallopian tube and, in the event of tubal rupture, prompt
treatment is critical to avoid hemorrhage and maternal death. Ectopic pregnancies account for about one in every
50 pregnancies (120,000 per year) in the United States. Current ultrasonography procedures misdiagnose
ectopic pregnancy in up to 40% of cases, while methotrexate treatment for confirmed EP has a failure rate of
more than 10%. During the time prior to ultrasonographic visualization, the pregnancy biomarker human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is used to evaluate growth but is a poor measure of the implantation site. This
project aims to establish an imaging modality for localization of the early placenta utilizing nanoparticles targeting
the trophoblast layer of the placenta. Contrast-enhanced imaging modalities (e.g., MRI) can substantially
improve ectopic pregnancy detection. However, the use of conventional contrast agents, including gadolinium-
based MRI contrast agents, is discouraged as low molecular weight compounds cross the placenta and can
incur fetal toxicity in viable pregnancies. To address this challenge, a biocompatible polymeric nanoplatform will
be utilized that accumulates specifically in placental tissue, but not the fetus, after intravenous injection. This
nanoplatform will be loaded with newly developed magnetic nanoparticles that are highly efficient MRI contrast
agents, and placenta accumulation/detection/visualization will be assessed in placenta cells and small animal
models. Furthermore, the ability to impair the developing placenta, and thus terminate ectopic pregnancy, will
be demonstrated by magnetic hyperthermia mediated by trophoblast-targeted nanoparticles. The premise of this
proposal is that specifically designed nanoparticles can detect early placentation, and subsequent magnetic
hyperthermia can provide a non-invasive option to treat ectopic pregnancy. To advance the proposed approach
for ectopic pregnancy management, our multidisciplinary team of investigators with complementary expertise in
nanomedicine, magnetic hyperthermia, and clinical placenta research proposes, in Aim 1, to evaluate the
biodistribution profile and placenta uptake of the developed nanoparticles (non-targeted and trophoblast-
targeted) in human/macaque placental cells and in mice. In Aim 2, the MRI imaging efficiency and short- and
long-term toxicity of the placenta-targeted nanoparticles will be evaluated in pregnant mice. In Aim 3, the safety
and therapeutic efficacy of magnetic hyperthermia mediated by our magnetic nanoparticles will be accessed for

Acute hydrocephalus frequently complicates brain injury including intracerebral (ICH) and subarachnoid
hemorrhage (SAH), requiring emergent placement of an external ventricular drain (EVD). The EVD allows rapidly
accumulated blood to exit, immediately relieving dangerous increased pressure on the brain. Most patients do
not need the EVD after this, while 18-30% develop chronic hydrocephalus and require permanent cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) shunt placement. There is great variability in the management of EVDs across centers, particularly
about when to wean EVDs and the approach to surveying and diagnosing EVD-related infection. The longer the
EVD is present and the more frequently the EVD is accessed to sample CSF (to test infection), the higher the risk
for infection which contributes to high morbidity and mortality. SAH and ICH patients endure EVDs for 11.5-16
days (max > 30), with typical ventriculitis onset occurring at 9.5 days. This vicious cycle is hidden in the cost:
37,000 patients a year receive an EVD in the setting of acute hydrocephalus in the US annually, generating in-
hospital charges of $151,672 per patient, or $5.6 billion dollars a year. There is a great need to optimize EVD
management by recognizing EVD-related infection while reducing CSF sampling and accurately determining
need for permanent shunting (or ability to liberate from temporary drainage), and to do so as early as possible
to minimize duration of drainage and length of stay. Our central hypothesis is that there is temporal information
in digitized patient data that is reflective of intracranial dynamics that can be harvested to break the negative
cycle of ventriculitis and shunt dependency. In previous work, we discovered that intracranial pressure waveform
morphology changes two days prior to the clinical diagnosis of ventriculitis. Additionally, we identified a predictor
of future CSF shunt dependency as early as four days after EVD placement, building on the correlation of
radiographic hydrocephalus changes with concurrent CSF drainage volume. We aim to develop a multicenter
purpose-built dataset for the management of acute hydrocephalus including physiologic data such as intracranial
pressure waveform, imaging, and clinical data. Using this dataset, we will be able to improve and validate our
machine learning models for detection of ventriculitis and prediction of shunt dependence. We will leverage the
diversity of the data inputs for model generalizability while also identifying and reducing bias by using a
Federated Learning framework for model training and validation. Finally, we will survey physicians to evaluate
decision making around EVD management and assess openness to adopting computed prediction scores."

Air pollution is responsible for >213,000 excess deaths in the U.S. annually, and globally remains the 4th
leading cause of mortality. Further, most air pollution-related mortality is due to cardiovascular (CV) disease.
We and others have found that short term air pollution exposure increases systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 2-
10 mmHg, while longer term exposure promotes the onset of hypertension (HTN)—which represents a key
pathway from air pollution exposure to risk of CV disease. However, there is a gap in evidence in support of
personal strategies to reduce the adverse CV effects of air pollution, and consensus required to change public
policy on air pollution remains elusive. Until this evidence gap is addressed, air pollution exposure will remain a
potentially modifiable yet untreated risk factor for HTN and subsequent CV disease. In this context, the overall
objective of our proposal is to perform a pivotal clinical trial to test personal air cleaners (PACs) in indoor
settings to reduce fine particulate air pollution <2.5 µM (PM2.5)—the most vasculotoxic component of air
pollution—and lower SBP among a cohort of adults with treated and untreated HTN. Data from our group and
others show that PACs lower SBP by 3-5 mmHg over 3-10 days, have larger (≈8mmHg) reductions in SBP
among obese adults, and that these benefits may be driven by reductions in inflammatory cytokines. Under-
resourced communities—such as urban public housing residents—experience both indoor and outdoor air
pollution inequities, excess burdens of obesity and HTN, and are at high risk for the persistent adverse health
effects from PM2.5 exposure. We hypothesize that PACs reduce PM2.5 and lower SBP in a sustained fashion
among adults with treated and untreated HTN in New York City public housing. To test this hypothesis, we will
evaluate whether PACs reduce PM2.5 and SBP over longer, clinically relevant time horizons, and in a larger
cohort than studied by other investigators to date. Further, we will evaluate inflammatory cytokines as
predictors of SBP response to PACs. Guided by strong preliminary data, this proposal will pursue three specific
aims: 1) Determine if PACs lower morning (AM) self-measured home SBP (H-SBP) over 30, 90 and 180 days
among 440 adults with treated and untreated HTN living in New York City public housing; 2) Test if adults with
HTN and increased adiposity have larger decreases in morning H-SBP with PACs compared to adults with less
adiposity; and 3) Determine whether higher baseline inflammatory cytokines predict a greater SBP response to
PACs. This proposal is innovative in its use of self-measured home blood pressure, air pollution monitoring,
and cytokine measurements in an urban public housing community with excess burdens of obesity and HTN
and is significant because it will advance knowledge of whether PACs can be used to reduce PM2.5 exposure—
on an individual level—and lower blood pressure, a meaningful health endpoint causally linked to CV disease.
Ultimately, such knowledge may provide millions of Americans and populations worldwide with access to a
personal strategy to reduce the adverse CV effects of air pollution exposure."

Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that is inhaled into the lungs and can
disseminate to the brain, causing a highly fatal meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients,
particularly those with HIV/AIDS, solid organ transplantation, and cancer. Even with contemporary combination
antifungal therapy, the mortality rate for cryptococcosis approximates 25%, and the at-risk population is
expanding with the development of new immunosuppressive regimens for autoimmunity and cancer. Our ability
to develop new treatments for cryptococcosis remains limited because we do not yet fully understand how the
fungus evades host immunity. We recently discovered that C. neoformans is able to suppress the response of
inflammatory monocytes, innate immune cells that give rise to macrophages and dendritic cells and typically
aid in fungal recognition and clearance by the host. C. neoformans directs inflammatory monocytes to
differentiate into alternatively activated (M2) macrophages that are permissive for fungal proliferation and
dissemination, leading to increased mortality from the infection. We have identified a signaling adapter DNAX-
activating protein of 12 kDa (DAP12) that may play a crucial role in suppressing the inflammatory monocyte
response to C. neoformans. The deletion of DAP12 improves fungal clearance and survival in a murine model
of cryptococcosis, and DAP12-deficient monocyte-derived macrophages have better uptake and killing of the
fungus. Additionally, the lungs of Dap12-/- mice have increased numbers of CD8+ T cells, cytotoxic adaptive
immune cells that can be recruited and activated by macrophages and are important for the clearance of C.
neoformans. Thus, DAP12 may be an important target for reversing the suppressive effects of C. neoformans
on the fungicidal activity of inflammatory monocytes and their ability to prime CD8+ T cells. Our preliminary
data indicate that this repressive DAP12 activity may be regulated by the binding of C. neoformans to the cell
surface receptor triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) on monocyte-derived
macrophages. The goal of this proposal is to further define this novel DAP12 signaling pathway. We
hypothesize that C. neoformans induces formation of a TREM2-DAP12 signaling complex that coordinates
effector molecules to inhibit the anti-cryptococcal defenses of inflammatory monocytes and CD8+ T cells,
thereby subverting the host response to infection. The specific aims are to 1) determine the mechanism by
which DAP12 signaling is initiated by C. neoformans, 2) define the signaling cascade that mediates the
suppressive effects of DAP12 during infection, and 3) ascertain the role of inflammatory monocyte-intrinsic
DAP12 in the regulation of CD8+ T cell responses to C. neoformans. Defining these mechanisms will deepen
our understanding of host immunity to opportunistic fungi and inform new opportunities for immunomodulatory
interventions against C. neoformans in vulnerable hosts."

Multisensory integration plays a central role in speech acquisition as most infants harness auditory and visual
information to crack the language code. Disruption to multisensory processing in the first year of life is
associated with later speech delay and language disorders. Although research in adults has identified several
brain measures and brain regions involved in multisensory processing, how this process emerges in infants
and how it is related to behavioral outcome, especially language outcome, is very much unknown. The
primary objective of this Career Development Award is to support training in multimodal brain imaging
in order to examine functional and structural mechanisms of multisensory development and their
associations with speech acquisition and language outcomes in typically developing (TD) and preterm
infants. Improved understanding of normal multisensory integration and deviations from normal will inform
early diagnosis and intervention strategies for infant speech delay/disorders.
The proposed award builds upon the candidate’s prior training in speech processing and multisensory
perception, extending this knowledge into the domains of infant brain imaging (function and structure) and
infant vocalization analysis. Aim 1 characterizes the neural bases of multisensory integration in TD and
preterm infants and investigates brain-behavior associations in infants 9 to 12 months old (Time 1).
Specifically, Aim 1a investigates cortical neural processes (obtained via infant magnetoencephalography
(MEG)) following congruent versus incongruent audiovisual speech stimuli, with a focus on alpha activity in
auditory cortex and gamma activity in Broca’s area. Aim 1b examines whether the MEG measures of
multisensory processing as well as DTI measures of structural connectivity are associated with pre-verbal
vocalization (i.e., canonical babbling). Aim 2b tests whether the brain measures and vocalization assessment
in the first year of life predict speech/language outcome at 24 months. Finally, Exploratory Aim 3 directly
compares these measures in preterm infants versus TD infants. Although the K01 study investigate complex
multisensory speech mechanisms, the research is feasible given the candidate’s background and the available
institutional resources (scientists and technology). Study findings are expected to inform theoretical modals of
early speech development as well as provide the candidate pilot data for future R01 clinical brain imaging
studies on atypical multisensory development in at-risk infant populations.
The award will also provide the candidate the opportunity to obtain training in behavioral assessment of
speech/language development and cutting-edge multimodal imaging techniques. The research performed and
training provided by this award is critical to the candidate’s long-term goal of conducting independent research
on the neurophysiological mechanisms of speech/language development and disorders."

Recent technological advances indicate that somatic DNA mutations accumulate with age and are remarkably
prevalent. The accumulation of mutations in blood cells has been associated with increases in all-cause
mortality and cardiometabolic diseases. Studies have focused on the precancerous clonal hematopoiesis state
that results from mutations in “driver” genes that recurrently mutate in blood cancers. However, this class of
mutations represent a small fraction of the total somatic mosaicism that occurs in blood. Mosaic loss of the Y
chromosome (mLoY) in blood is the most common post-zygotic mutation in humans. Epidemiological studies
have associated mLoY with all-cause mortality and a number of age-associated diseases. However, it is
unknown whether there is a causal connection between mLoY and cardiovascular disease. Here, we will
employ multiple murine models to assess the impact of mLoY in heart failure, and investigate this relationship
at a mechanistic level."
