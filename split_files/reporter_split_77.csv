11100761,"Approximately 65% of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), or
AD related dementias (ADRD) experience neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS). These debilitating symptoms
include depression, anxiety, apathy, delusions, hallucinations, agitation, sleep disturbances and are associated
with faster disease progression, greater functional impairment, higher caregiver burden, and earlier
institutionalization. Current treatments for NPS in MCI/dementia have limited efficacy but high rates of adverse
side effects, including higher mortality. Therefore, safe and effective treatments for NPS are urgently needed.
However, we have limited insights into molecular mechanisms of NPS in MCI/dementia to nominate
therapeutic targets. To address this knowledge gap, we aim to elucidate the genetic and molecular
mechanisms underlying NPS in MCI/dementia using two complementary but independent approaches.
 In the first approach, we will leverage the substantial genetic basis of NPS (heritability of ~61%) to
identify novel genes involved in NPS. First, we will perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of NPS
in ~32,000 individuals with MCI/AD/ADRD from across the United States. We will perform a GWAS of each
NPS domain as well as a multivariate GWAS of all NPS collectively. Results of each GWAS will be integrated
with reference human brain transcriptomic and proteomic profiles to identify individual brain transcripts and
proteins that are consistent with being causal in NPS. We have applied these integrative approaches to AD
and identified 11 genes that regulate their brain protein abundances to predispose to AD (Wingo et al. 2021,
Nat Genet). Unlike GWAS results, these findings point to specific brain proteins that are consistent with a
causal role in AD. Importantly, this approach does not solely depend on genome-wide significant signals, and
the causal inference of this integrative strategy has been experimentally tested and found to be robust. Thus,
we expect that findings from this approach will provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of NPS.
 Our second approach aims to identify brain transcripts, proteins, and co-expression networks
associated with NPS. We will perform transcriptomic and proteomic sequencing of post-mortem brain tissues
from 400 individuals with MCI/AD and longitudinal NPS assessment, as existing brain omics data do not have
robust NPS measures. Then we will examine NPS domains individually as well as collectively in our differential
expression and network analyses. We anticipate that molecular alterations at the brain transcript and protein
levels identified with this approach will provide insights into NPS pathogenesis and progression. Studying both
transcripts and proteins would provide complementary information and a more complete molecular picture. We
view understanding proteins as particularly important since they are the vast majority of drug targets.
 The proposed project will likely lead to new insights into molecular mechanisms and novel therapeutic
targets for NPS and thereby have an important and sustained impact on public health."

This Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award (K01) will support my pursuit of becoming an
independently funded investigator in Alzheimer’s and aging research. My proposal features a systematic
approach to a comprehensive training plan including mentorship, didactic and experiential learning activities,
and professional development opportunities, as well as a complementary research project establishing
foundational evidence for my research agenda centered on improving care of people with Alzheimer’s disease,
related dementias, and diabetes mellitus (ADRD-DM). My training goals are designed to attain essential
advanced knowledge and skills pertaining to 1) ADRD collaborative care and research, 2) DM collaborative
care and research, and 3) health systems and clinical trials. My research and training will take advantage of
the immense resources and expertise at supporting centers across Indiana University, the Regenstrief
Institute, and Eskenazi Health, including the National Institute on Aging-funded Institute of Alzheimer’s Disease
Research Center and the IMPACT Collaboratory, and will be conducted under the mentorship of a
multidisciplinary team of ADRD, DM, and implementation science experts, who have clinical and research
experience in creating innovative technologies to improve care delivery in ADRD-DM populations. Building on
my expertise in human factors engineering, the research project will examine how use of information
technology can increase awareness of hypoglycemia and shared decisions about treatment options among
people with ADRD-DM and their caregivers and primary care clinicians. I will use a participatory design
process to develop assistive information technology that leverages continuous glucose monitoring devices. In
this experiential learning opportunity, I will gain insights into patients’ and caregivers’ perceptions and
experiences, clinicians’ information gaps and other barriers to individualizing ADRD-DM treatment, and the
design of technology to facilitate shared decision-making, while expanding the knowledge base on these
aspects of health care. Furthermore, I intend to increase representation of diverse socioeconomical and
cultural backgrounds among ADRD research participants and scientists. This K01 award will uniquely position
me to bring together human factors and ADRD-DM research to design and implement technology to assess
and improve the health of people with ADRD."

the Center for Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research – now has the scientists, the
environment, and the resources to respond and contribute to the challenges that Veterans' healthcare will
face in the years to come. CHOIR's MISSION is to conduct organizationally-partnered, and Veteran-
partnered research in order to develop, implement, and evaluate evidence-based and innovative practices
that improve VA healthcare. Our VISION is that CHOIR serve as a large, vibrant, multi-campus Center
which engages the healthcare- and university-rich environment of Greater Boston to enhance VA services
and contribute to health services research (HSR) nationally and internationally. Our PRIORITY GOALS
are: (1) to advance the field of HSR by sustaining, developing, and growing our existing, scientific focus
areas, and growing our evolving and emerging scientific areas; (2) to enrich VA's cadre of world-class HSR
investigators, by supporting training and education across the career spectrum; (3) to grow and support
innovation, to maintain VA at the cutting edge of HSR and adapt to meet VA's ever-changing needs.
 CHOIR's three main Scientific Focus Areas have developed from collaborations with key VA partners.
Enhancing Recovery-Oriented Care for Vulnerable Populations [Major Partners: Office of Mental
Health and Suicide Prevention, Center for Homelessness Among Veterans] seeks to understand and
implement models of care to develop Veterans' independence, particularly in those with behavioral
vulnerabilities such as mental health challenges, homelessness and involvement with the justice system.
Medication Management & Outcomes [Major Partner: Pharmacy Benefits Management] addresses best
practices for pharmaceutical use, including studies of the quality, safety, and value of prescribing and
studies to engage Veterans in medication decision-making and improve adherence. Healthcare
Communications [Major Partners: Office of Connected Care, Office of Patient-Centered Care & Cultural
Transformation] conducts research on communicating adverse events to patients, on communicating with
patients using connected care technologies, and on patient-centered communication and care
coordination. In addition to these, CHOIR's Evolving Scientific Areas, first germinated as new emerging
areas 5 years ago, are now mature: Long-Term Care is partnered with the VA Office of Geriatrics and
Extended Care and studies Community Living Centers, models of Geriatric primary care, and team-based
care for the elderly, and Patient Safety, partnered with the VA National Center for Patient Safety, improves
measurement of patient safety by facilitating standardization and integration across existing patient safety
measures, developing and testing new measures to improve on traditional approaches.
 CHOIR research has had major impacts on research and on VA systems of care. Just two out of many
examples are Dr. Elwy's work, which has changed how VA surgeons are taught to talk to their patients
about surgical adverse events; and Dr. Bokhour's development of metrics to assess the impact of the VA

11102858,"Abstract
The dynamic regulation of metabolic states plays an active role in cellular differentiation decisions, and this
occurs throughout mammalian development. The conservation of these processes in different species,
developmental settings, and immune cell types suggests metabolism influences common mechanistic events
needed for differentiation decisions in diverse cellular backgrounds. However, the interpretation of these
conserved mechanisms must have a component of cell-type specificity to properly regulate the genome to
promote appropriate differentiation in individual cellular settings. Therefore, it is important to define the
conserved and cell-type specific mechanistic principles to understand how dietary and metabolic interventions
influence immune cell differentiation in the context of healthy and disease states. In the previous funding cycle
of this grant, we identified a role for alpha-ketoglutarate (aKG) in regulating the IL-2-sensitive gene program in
T cells. Mechanistically, aKG-sensitive events enhanced the association of CTCF with a subset of sites in
CD4+ T cells, and together with studies in cancer cells, the data indicated this overall activity is conserved in
diverse cell-types. The data also suggested these events are interpreted in a cell-type specific manner,
potentially based on the enhancer landscape of the cell. In this grant, we will extend these findings to address
how aKG-sensitive CTCF sites are selected, and whether there are any cell-type dependent mechanisms
selecting these sites. We will also define whether downstream mechanisms, such as enhancer activity, have
sensitivity to metabolic states. In this context, we will address whether the enhancer landscape is regulated by
short chain fatty acids such as butyrate and acetate. We will also define which aspects of metabolite-sensitive
mechanisms are conserved between species, and how variation between the mouse and human genome
influences the interpretation of conserved and cell-type specific events. Information gained in these studies will
be critical for predicting the role for metabolic and dietary interventions in the treatment of immunological
diseases and in promoting effective immune responses to infectious diseases."
11109626,"CADRE seeks renewed COIN funding to continue to address an HSR&D research emphasis in health care
access and equity while focusing on Secretary Shulkin’s priorities to provide greater choice for Veterans, focus
resources more efficiently, and improve timeliness of services. One-third of all enrolled Veterans are
considered rural. Rural Veterans face unique barriers to care related to shortages of both VHA and community
providers in rural areas, long distances to existing providers, poor availability of broadband internet to support
digital interventions and high rates of poverty. VISN 23 has the highest proportion of rural Veterans, therefore,
CADRE investigators seek to understand access barriers from the rural Veteran’s perspective and develop
interventions that enhance existing VHA and community resources in rural settings. In addition, CADRE aims
to build upon our existing expertise, established operational partnerships and long-term research priorities
through prioritizing five overarching Center goals that align with our focused areas of research and emerging
priorities:
GOAL 1: Improve access to high quality care for rural Veterans through innovative applications of telehealth in
specialty care, community care, and dual use. (Focused Area #1)
GOAL 2: Develop and evaluate interventions targeting the multidrug-resistant organism (MDRO) crisis.
(Focused Area #2)
GOAL 3: Expand our efforts in developing innovative health services research in three emerging areas:
(1) women’s health, (2) epidemic opioid use and substance use disorders, and (3) cardiovascular outcomes.
GOAL 4: Continue the Center’s success in supporting mentored career-development.
GOAL 5: Promote Veteran engagement with recognition that Veterans are experts on Veteran experience.
The proposed focused areas, additional emerging areas and related goals build upon CADRE investigators’
strengths and leverage established partnerships with the Office of Rural Health, Office of Connected Care,
Office of Specialty Care, MDRO Prevention Office, VISN 23, Pharmacy Benefits Management Services, Iowa
City VA Health Care System, the University of Iowa and the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC).
CADRE investigators have had significant recent accomplishments including: (1) designing and evaluating 2 of
the 5 Office of Rural Health’s Promising Practices; (2) leading a field-based meeting with 37 experts to
establish the national research priorities for MDRO in VA; (3) serving as Senior Reproductive Endocrinologist
and Fertility expert to Women’s Health Service, (4) the making key recommendations to VA leadership
regarding community care, dual use, MDROs, telehealth, and women’s health; and (5) publishing articles that
move their respective fields forward.
CADRE will continue to be led by two accomplished scientists, Eli Perencevich and Heather Reisinger, who’s
leadership in MDRO prevention and rural access provide experience and the necessary connections with VA
operations to continue our success in partner-oriented health services research in the Focused Areas."

11108189,"The melanocortin signaling pathway has emerged as a key signaling system regulating normal body-weight
homeostasis and energy balance. Activation of melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) by ?-MSH reduces fat stores
by decreasing food intake and increasing energy expenditure. Yet, the cellular mechanism(s) underlying
melanocortin actions remains poorly understood. Our preliminary data point to the importance of ROCK1 action
in MC4R-expressing neurons that is significant for the development of obesity in mice and humans. We found
that selective deletion of ROCK1 in MC4R-expressing or Sim1-expressing neurons significantly increases body
weight and adiposity. Interestingly, we found that ROCK1 activation in MC4R-containing neurons is required for
the anorexigenic action of melanocortin through suppressing AMPK. Evidence demonstrates that UBE2O is an
upstream mediator of AMPK that targets ?2AMPK for ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, we observed
that human ROCK1 variant (2824G<A, E942K) from a consanguineous population in Pakistan displays severe
obesity, and the mutant mice carrying the human ROCK1 mutation (E942K) are obese. We therefore hypothesize
that ROCK1 in MC4R-expressing neurons is necessary for the metabolic regulation of normal body-weight
homeostasis and energy balance and is linked with the UBE2O-AMPK signaling cascade for anorexigenic action
of melanocortin. Thus, an impaired ROCK1 signaling axis leads to energy imbalance, causing obesity. To this
end, we will (i) elucidate the functional importance of ROCK1 in MC4R-expressing neurons in the control of
energy balance; (ii) establish the mechanism(s) by which ROCK1 mediates the effect of melanocortin on feeding;
and (iii) explore the significance of the human ROCK1 mutation (E942K) in regulating energy balance. To
accomplish these goals, we will employ state-of-the-art biochemical, molecular, cellular, and metabolic
physiological techniques, including genetically engineered tissue-specific transgenic mouse models, mutant
mice carrying the human ROCK1-E942K mutation, Cre-inducible AAV, DREADD, and the rAAV-FlexON switch
system. These studies will provide a unique opportunity to establish a novel mechanism implicating ROCK1 as
a key determinant of hypothalamic energy balance. The data generated from these timely studies may offer
further insights into the pathogenesis of obesity-linked metabolic diseases and lead to new therapeutic targets
for the treatment of obesity."
11108391,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The dynamic regulation of chromatin is critical for proper gene expression, and dysregulation leads to diseases
including cancer and metabolic disorders. The basic subunit of chromatin is the nucleosome, which is formed by
a histone protein core around which DNA wraps. The unstructured histone termini, referred to as histone tails,
protrude from this core and are key players in chromatin regulation. Incorporation of histone post-translational
modifications (PTMs, chemical or protein modification of histone residues) and histone variants (histones with
distinct sequences that substitute for canonical histones) are two major mechanisms of chromatin regulation,
and they act in part through the histone tails. Despite great strides being made in understanding the chromatin
landscape, large gaps remain in our knowledge of chromatin structure, gene regulation, and the histone
language. The long-term goal of the laboratory is to define the chromatin landscape (the complex molecular
interactions within and between nucleosomes along with their genetic and epigenetic factors) that underlies gene
expression so that dysregulation that causes human disease can be corrected. The objective is to develop a
molecular-level understanding of the conformation and dynamics of the histone tails within the nucleosome along
with their bridging interactions (altogether, the histone tail landscape) and how these translate to the level of
chromatin structure and accessibility. This includes determining how histone tail landscapes are perturbed by
histone post-translational modifications and histone variants and how these landscapes are interconnected with
each other and those of other nucleosome components. In this five-year MIRA proposal, the focus will be on: 1)
determining how lysine acylations differentially regulate the histone tail landscape to contribute to metabolically-
linked differential gene regulation, and 2) the variant-specific role of the centromeric H3 variant in regulating
chromatin structure during mitosis and chromosome stability. A pairing of solution NMR spectroscopy with other
biophysical approaches and phase separation studies, as proposed here, is essential to decipher this highly
dynamic and heterogeneous system. Understanding the structural and dynamic effects of histone PTMs and
variants on regulatory control of gene expression and chromatin structure will lead to a significant enhancement
in our understanding of fundamental mechanisms of gene regulation and epigenetically-linked diseases."
11109124,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Transformation of the early embryo from a seemingly disorganized ball of stem cells to the complex and
precisely patterned adult form requires stereotyped regulation cell behaviors via biophysical and biochemical
cues. Using the chick embryo, the long term goals of my research program are to understand from a highly
quantitative perspective how this is orchestrated. Approximately half of the lab focuses on mechanobiology of
embryonic development, seeking to understand the forces that shape tissues and organs in the embryo and
the cues that specify those forces. The remainder of the lab studies cell fate determination, either in the context
of early brain development or in the developing gut. The present application stems from the latter.
During embryonic development, one of the first major steps in lineage segregation is gastrulation, when a
single totipotent layer of cells separates into three germ layers, endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. While
conventionally, it has long been accepted that all progenitors of each germ layer are generated only during
gastrulation, recent studies have challenged this, identifying a multipotent progenitor population that persists
after gastrulation ends in the tailbud. Within this population, known as neuromesodermal progenitors, a single
cell can give rise to progeny that contribute to both notochord (mesoderm) and neural tube (ectoderm). While
studying gut tube formation in the chick embryo, we recently identified a population of endoderm cells that line
the ventral surface of the tailbud, and appear to undergo a widespread and previously unreported epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition (EMT). These cells invade the neighboring tailbud tissue, reaching as far as the dorsal
surface of the tailbud. Importantly, cells can be seen dispersed throughout the region where neuromesodermal
progenitors are known to reside, as well as in the neural tube and notochord. This suggests that these
endodermal cells represent an unappreciated source of neuromesodermal progenitors, which, if they retain the
ability to generate endodermal tissues as well, would be remarkable. The present application combines
classical embryology approaches such as fate mapping and grafting experiments with gene misexpression and
single-cell RNA Sequencing in an effort to make sense of the simple yet puzzling observation that endoderm
cells undergo a localized EMT and invade the tailbud at a time when gastrulation is complete. The proposal
aims to identify the tissues to which this prospective progenitor population contributes, and to construct a
detailed single-cell transcriptomic atlas of this population, from which identity, regulatory circuits, and proposed
lineage trajectories can be inferred. At the completion of the proposed work, we will have established a new in
vivo model to study endodermal EMT, and potentially identified a novel stem cell population residing in the
endoderm, with the ability to give rise to mesodermal and ectodermal cells. This stands in contrast to long-held
notions of lineage segregation during embryonic development, and therefore has the potential to be
transformative for the fields of developmental biology and stem cell reprogramming."
11109651,"The mission of the Center to Improve Veteran Involvement in Care (CIVIC), located at VA Portland Health
Care System (VAPORHCS), is to conduct research that empowers Veterans to improve their health through
engagement in self-care, engagement with VA and non-VA healthcare systems, and engagement in health
services research. This mission supports several VHA 2018-2024 strategic objectives including empowering
Veterans to improve their health and to make healthcare decisions by ensuring transparency of information,
and emphasizing Veterans’ and their families’ whole health and wellness. Secretary Shulkin’s 2018 Five
Priorities for VA reaffirm the importance of creating new processes and systems that support Veteran-centric
decision-making around care and care settings. CIVIC proposes six main goals and two focus areas. The first
goal (Focused Area 1) is to conduct research that helps Veterans with mental health conditions, including pain,
improve their health and safety. This focus area includes research on suicide prevention, the use of
prescription opioids, and optimization of non-opioid pain care—these topics are also high priorities in VHA. The
second goal (Focused Area 2) is to conduct research that helps Veterans, their supports, and their clinicians
create and sustain effective healthcare relationships. Additional CIVIC goals are to 3) support additional high
value, innovative research that falls outside of our focused areas; 4) collaborate with a diverse set of
stakeholders including Veterans to enhance research and build bridges between innovation and evidence; 5)
further develop CIVIC expertise in dissemination and implementation; and 6) support career development of
promising junior and established investigators to build health services research capacity.
CIVIC's Operational Partners are the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention; Office of Patient
Centered Care and Cultural Transformation; Pain Management; VISN-20; and VAPORHCS. Veteran
stakeholders provide ongoing feedback about CIVIC operations and directions through our Veteran
Engagement Group. Each of CIVIC’s 19 Core investigators is a faculty member of VAPORHCS’s primary
academic affiliate, Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). CIVIC’s Director is Steven Dobscha MD, and
its Associate Director is Linda Ganzini MD, MPH. Guided by its Steering Committee (which includes
Operations partners, two Veterans, and representatives from OHSU and other Centers of Innovation) and
CIVIC’s Executive Committee, CIVIC will, over the next five years, capitalize on several areas of methodologic
and content expertise to achieve its strategic goals. These areas of strength include use of mixed-methods
research; acquisition and synthesis of information from multiple stakeholders; expertise in understanding
Veterans’ healthcare experiences; evidence synthesis; Veteran engagement in research; suicide prevention;
opioids, pain and substance use disorder; lung cancer; and the use of technology to enhance care. In addition
to conducting high value research within and outside of our Focused Areas, specific objectives include
enhancing collaborations and developing multisite projects with investigators at other VA facilities,
incorporating more implementation and dissemination objectives into our projects, maintaining a steady
pipeline of Career Development Awardees and Advanced Health Services Research Fellowship trainees, and
expanding the range of our Veteran engagement activities.
In summary, VHA priorities include partnering with Veterans to create personal, proactive strategies to improve
health and well-being, empowering Veterans by creating opportunities for Veteran decision-making, and
enhancing Veteran and family engagement in care and research. CIVIC findings and products will address
these VHA priorities."
11109696,"Given Veterans' increasing choices about where and how they receive care, successful coordination of care
will require improving effective communication among a variety of individuals and entities, as well as improved
management and use of health information. Health information and health communication go hand in hand.
The VA Health Services Research and Development (HSR&D) Center for Health Information and
Communication (CHIC) is an HSR&D Center of Innovation (COIN) that is uniquely positioned to continue to
address this need for VA and Veterans. The CHIC's mission is to improve Veterans' health care through
innovative research on health information, technology, and communication. The CHIC's vision is to improve
Veterans' health through innovative applications of health information and health information systems that
serve the population-based and interpersonal needs of patients and health professionals. Summarized below
are the CHIC's three primary goals and two focused areas of research for the next five years.
• Goal A. Advance the science of health information and communication, to improve the coordination,
quality, safety, and value of health care for Veterans. This goal has the following two focus areas.
 Focus Area 1. Advance technologies that promote improved information management, and engage and
connect Veterans, clinicians, and VA operations partners, to improve healthcare decision-making, policy,
and outcomes.
 Focus Area 2. Optimize interpersonal communication among Veterans, clinicians, and other caregivers,
to promote Veteran-centered care.
• Goal B. Bring about improvements in clinical practice through the translation and implementation of health
services research (see Section C3, Implementation and Dissemination).
• Goal C. Cultivate a vibrant community of scientists in health services research and development, with the
skills and passion to improve VA healthcare through a focus on health information, communication, and
implementation (see Section C4, Mentoring and Career Development).
Our areas of expertise include health information exchange, interpersonal communication, clinical decision
support, human-computer interactions, transfers of responsibility in care, cancer care, care for Veterans with
chronic pain, improving care for stroke, and improving care for mental illness. Our work over the next five years
will span a wide range of science, with the potential to transform aspects of VA healthcare for the better. One
project will improve health information tools to ease the burden of medication reconciliation. Another, bridging
our two focus areas of health technology and communication, will support providers in negotiating
documentation in an electronic health record while maintaining person-centered communication with the
patient. Another study beginning this year will coach providers and patients on how to share decisions about
the use of opioids and alternative treatments to manage chronic pain. Every project is driven by clinical and
operational partners, including the Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record Health Program, Office of Connected
Care, Office of Mental Health Operations, National Pain Management Office, and Regenstrief Institute.
From FY15-FY17, our Center has maintained close to 20 core scientists who generated nearly $17.5 million in
project funding and over 270 health services research publications.
The CHIC, VA's first research center focused on health information and technology, will continue to build on
VA's foundation as a leader, to identify and integrate what is known about the impact of its investment in health
information technology, and to determine how systems-based and interpersonal communication of health
information can improve delivery and outcomes of care."

 Our investigators improve clinical management in VHA through three focused areas (FAs) of research:
FA1. To promote personalized, appropriate, and efficient care by integrating the routine use of digital
data into day-to-day care delivery through innovations in data collection, measurement, and analysis.
 In the coming five years, our research will address VHA priorities on modernization, patient-centered care,
care coordination, and access through studies that improve predictive modeling for disease progression,
measure treatment de-intensification, track patient-reported outcomes, and reduce overuse of services in VA
and the community. Our key partners include the national VA Offices of: Reporting, Analytics, Performance
Improvement, and Deployment; Veterans Access to Care; and Community Care.
FA2. To develop, implement, and evaluate systems-based approaches to improve safety and
outcomes for our most vulnerable, high-risk, and complex patients.
 In the next five years, our studies will use innovative approaches for reducing misuse of opioids, alcohol,
and cannabis, and for decreasing suicide risk, all key VHA priorities. We will also create tools to assess and
implement systems-based interventions to decrease adverse events for hospitalized and critically ill patients,
both during and after their inpatient stays. Our key partners include the Office of Mental Health and Suicide
Prevention, VISN 10, and the National Center for Patient Safety.
FA3. To develop innovative approaches for improving patient engagement in the prevention and
management of chronic conditions.
 In the next five years, we will forward VHA priorities for Veteran and family engagement and innovative use
of technology through studies that extend peer support approaches to new clinical areas, employ mHealth to
examine Veterans’ experience with community care, improve screening decisions, and apply behavioral
economics theory to decrease overuse of low-value services. Our key partners include the National Center
for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention and the Michigan National Guard."
11109724,"This application proposes the continuation of a Center of Innovation (COIN), called the Pain Research,
Informatics, Multimorbidities, and Education (PRIME) Center. The COIN builds on the successes of our

11109682,"The Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion (CHERP) is an HSR&D Center of Innovation
representing a strong collaboration between the VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System and Corporal Michael J.
Crescenz VA Medical Center and their academic affiliates, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of
Pennsylvania. CHERP will sustain a primary research focus on improving the quality and equity of health and
health care for vulnerable Veteran populations, grow and integrate a secondary research focus on clinical
therapeutics, and support additional health services research (HSR) that addresses VA and HSR&D priorities.
CHERP's mission is to advance the quality and equity of health and health care for Veterans through HSR,
research training and mentoring, service, partnerships, and stakeholder engagement. To achieve this mission
CHERP will pursue 6 strategic goals designed to: advance our primary and secondary research foci (Goals 1 and
2); increase partnerships, collaborations, and stakeholder engagement (Goal 3); enhance mentoring, training
and educational programs (Goal 4); provide service and leadership (Goal 5); and augment infrastructure to
conduct high-impact HSR and translate it into practice and policy (Goal 6). CHERP has explicit objectives and
investigator-initiated and Center-driven activities to achieve each goal during the next 5 years.
CHERP will thrive under the continued leadership of Dr. Michael Fine (Director), augmented by new
direction from Drs. Judith Long (Co-Director), Sonya Borrero (Associate Director) and Melissa Dichter
(Associate Director). This team will use their track records of partnered HSR, program development and
administration, and mentoring to oversee the execution of CHERP's strategic goals and objectives and
ensure positive impacts on Veteran health and health care.
CHERP's greatest asset is its 37 core investigators with broad expertise in quantitative and qualitative research
and quality improvement methods, including clinical trials, clinical epidemiology, genomics, health behavior
change, “big data” analyses, pharmaceutical outcomes, psychometrics, behavioral economics, decision analysis,
meta-analysis, technology assessment, and implementation science.
CHERP investigators partner with VA stakeholders to maximize the value and impact their work. Key
partners include the host VA Medical Centers, VISN4, the Office of Health Equity, Pharmacy Benefits
Management and the national Center for Medication Safety. CHERP also uses Veteran Community Advisory
Boards at each site to maximize the Veteran-centricity of its research, training, and other activities. In
addition, CHERP investigators collaborate with colleagues from other institutions and a broad range of
clinical specialties and academic disciplines.
CHERP's research advances scientific knowledge, guides clinical care and policy, and improves Veteran
health and health care as demonstrated by numerous high impact scientific publications, and the
development of new clinical tools and scientific methods. CHERP's work has led to improvements in the
quality and equity of health and health care and for vulnerable Veteran populations and enhanced the
appropriateness, safety, and value of clinical therapeutics in VA. During the renewal, CHERP will assess the
emerging impact of VA community care on the health and health care of vulnerable Veterans and the effects
of dual use of VA and non-VA health care on the usage patterns, safety, and value of clinical therapeutics."
11109686,"The Informatics, Decision-Enhancement, and Analytic Sciences (IDEAS) Center of Innovation creates a
dynamic environment within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) where informatics is tightly integrated
with health services research and other disciplines. Biomedical informatics is a unifying theme of the IDEAS
Center, as many of our investigators are both health services researchers and informaticians, engaging in
research that bridges both fields. This overlap reflects the historical prominence of informatics at the VA Salt
Lake City Health Care System and our close affiliation with VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure
(VINCI).The IDEAS Center seeks to drive transformation of healthcare delivery in the Veterans Health
Administration through an integrated portfolio of translational research closely tied to operational partnerships:
• Apply qualitative and quantitative methods of inquiry to elicit stakeholder perspectives, characterize clinical
 gaps, and identify information needs.
• Generate new knowledge to improve prediction of impacts of health system changes, to support clinical
 practice improvement, and to guide mitigation of adverse outcomes in Veterans.
• Design and implement innovative solutions to high priority problems, advancing VHA as a learning health
 care system.
• Collaborate with operational partners to disseminate interventions that enhance the quality, efficiency, and
 safety of health care delivery in the Veterans Health Administration and improve Veteran health.
IDEAS includes two areas of focused research, one emerging research area, and five methodological cores.
Our research reflects our investigators’ clinical expertise, coupled with our methodological strengths in
information visualization, natural language processing, decision-support system design, population analytics,
qualitative research, and pharmacoepidemiology. Our methods cores highlight our expanded research activities,
recruitment of new investigators, and increased emphasis on implementation science. Focus Area 1, Combating
Antibiotic Resistance, integrates our original focus areas, cognitive support for therapeutic decision-making
and healthcare-associated infections, and links with our new VA Quality Enhancement Research Initiative
(QUERI) Program, Combatting Antimicrobial Resistance through Rapid Implementation of Available Guidelines
and Evidence (CARRIAGE), to implement research innovations into the field. Our vision is of a transformed
VHA, recognized for its national leadership and success in antibiotic stewardship and infection prevention.
Focus Area 2, Mitigating Health Risks in Veterans across Periods of Vulnerability, extends our Center’s
previous research on post-deployment and rural health, integrating the expertise of our recently recruited junior
and senior investigators in addiction medicine, traumatic brain injury, and mental health. We will leverage new
types of data and state-of-the-art analytical approaches to better characterize the dynamic nature of risk and to
improve the accuracy of predictive algorithms for adverse outcomes, including suicidality and overdose. We
will focus on periods of vulnerability that are currently difficult to track, such as separation from military and
transition to community care. Finally, our understanding of sociotechnical systems in health care and of
hazards associated with health information technology motivates our emerging research area: Improving
Medication Safety as the VA Transitions to a New Electronic Health Record. Building on our expertise in
informatics, patient safety, and surveillance, we will use simulation tools to evaluate potential risks and statistical
models to estimate rates of actual events. Our goal is to anticipate the consequences of VHA’s implementation
of a new commercial electronic health record and to help ensure that this modernization effort leads to high
quality, safe care. Our research activities are all highly collaborative and closely connected to our operational
partnerships. Our partners trust us to be an ongoing source of innovation, which fits perfectly with our culture."
11102803,"Abstract: The activities of innate and adaptive immune cells need to be precisely coordinated for an effective
immune response to a wide-range of pathogens. There are many similarities between immune responses in
different species, but each species also has adapted to combat unique pathogenic insults. Mechanistically,
structural variation in the genome between species plays a prominent role in the acquisition (or loss) of
regulatory events involved in defining the functional activity of immune cells. Structural variation refers to
genome rearrangements such as translocations, insertions, amplifications, and inversions. Structural variation
in the genome between species has the potential to substantially alter the placement of genes and regulatory
elements, including splitting apart clusters of genes with similar functions, relocating genes to different
chromosomes, and changing the orientation of loci. The functional consequences for changes in the genome
between species are based on how each change affects the regulatory events responsible for controlling gene
expression. Therefore, it is important to define how structural variation between species affects regulatory
principles to improve our ability to relate findings from mechanistic and preclinical studies in model organisms
to the regulation of the human immune response. In this application, we will define how structural variation
between the mouse and human genomes influences the regulatory events involved in controlling genes that
are differentially expressed in mouse and human immune cells. We will determine how structural variation
between the mouse and human genomes affects the 1) topology of the genome, 2) regulatory events that
position topological domain boundaries, 3) enhancer landscape available to genes, and 4) long-range
enhancer-promoter interactions for genes with differences in expression between mouse and human immune
cells. We will test the functional consequences for divergent regulatory events between mouse and human
immune cells, with a focus on defining the regulatory events contributing to differences in the LPS-inducible
expression of Nos2 (encodes inducible nitric oxide synthase; iNOS) in mouse and human macrophages, and
we will use this to build a mouse model reflecting human expression. The mouse is one of the most widely
used preclinical models of the human immune response, and the studies in our proposal will aid in
understanding how structural variation between the genomes of model organisms and the human genome
contribute to species acquiring different cell-type and stimulation-dependent gene expression patterns and
functions. It will also make it possible to predict how mechanisms defined in mice translate to human as well as
build mouse models that better reflect human immune responses for pre-clinical studies."
11104105,"EXPOSURE: Project Summary/Abstract
This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as ""NOT-CA-
24-041"". Although engagement in long-term follow-up survivor care is critical to the lifelong health of the
growing childhood cancer survivor (CCS) population, >25% of CCS are not accessing survivor care nationally.
Understanding the factors impacting the landscape of pediatric survivor care (e.g., institutional uptake of
standards, population reach, patient engagement) may reduce gaps in care delivery for CCS. It is crucial to
engage CCS and their families in survivor care early to begin surveillance and educate young CCS about their
risks. Strong engagement in survivor care of young CCS is required to support CCS in lifelong survivor care.
The objectives of this supplement to the Winship Cancer Institute's NCI-designated P30 Cancer Center grant
are to examine: 1) alignment of the care offered to pediatric CCS with the National Standards for Survivorship
Care, 2) the long-term utilization of pediatric survivor services, and 3) patient- and family-level factors related to
long-term engagement in survivor care. We propose a mixed-method study that includes qualitative interviews
with pediatric providers, a retrospective chart review of a cohort of CCS patients, and secondary analyses of
patient-reported outcome (PRO) data from CCS caregivers. Specifically, we aim to: Examine the institutional
uptake of survivor services aligned with the National Standards for Survivorship Care offered in the Aflac
Pediatric Cancer Survivor Program (Aim 1), Evaluate the reach of the Aflac Pediatric Cancer Survivor Program
(Aim 2), and Identify patient-, caregiver- and family-level factors related to engagement in pediatric survivor
care over time (Aim 3). In Aim 1, we will conduct qualitative interviews with N=15 local pediatric oncology and
survivor care providers focused on the health system policies, processes, and evaluation methods used in the
Aflac Pediatric Cancer Survivor Program. In Aim 2, we will use an existing cohort of pediatric oncology patients
(<18 years) who became eligible for initial survivor services in 2016-2019 (N=284) and extract medical record
data to determine the proportion and representativeness of CCS who participated in survivor clinic visits and
recommended surveillance for late effects longitudinally over a five-year period. In Aim 3, we will use a subset
of the Aim 2 cohort with PRO data available (N=138) to evaluate the impact of familial psychosocial
functioning, CCS quality of life, caregiver health, knowledge of late-effects risks, and health beliefs during the
off-therapy period on future engagement in survivor care services. Study results will be used to: 1) inform
organizational improvements to support pediatric CCS at the Winship Cancer Institute, 2) develop a toolkit to
help other pediatric cancer centers assess and address gaps in survivor care, and 3) design interventions to
improve engagement in long-term pediatric survivor services. Improvements in survivor care practices for
pediatric CCS and interventions promoting long-term care will have the potential to decrease future morbidity
and mortality through early detection and treatment of chronic conditions after childhood cancer."
11106828,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The intersection of harm reduction and criminal legal systems (CLS) presents significant challenges and
opportunities for public health research. Recognizing the critical role of CLS as a structural determinant of
health, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) seeks to advance understanding and implementation of harm
reduction strategies within this context. Through an administrative supplement to the existing Harm
Reduction Research Network Coordination Center (HRRN-CC), this project aims to develop a
comprehensive roadmap for future research that addresses these challenges and leverages opportunities.
The HRRN-CC, funded by NIH, coordinates research across 10 projects focused on community-based harm
reduction strategies. This supplement will build on existing efforts by focusing specifically on CLS. Aim 1 will
facilitate the analysis and dissemination of measures related to CLS involvement and its intersection with
harm reduction. The HRRN CLS Workgroup will provide technical assistance for analyzing common CLS
metrics and support researchers in publishing findings. Aim 2 will identify opportunities for harm reduction
strategies across various points of CLS involvement using the Sequential Intercept Model and systematic
reviews of evidence-based practices. Aim 3 will seek consensus between harm reduction and CLS
practitioners on priority research areas through a Delphi process, engaging both the HRRN’s Community
Expert Council and JCOIN’s Board of Practitioners. Finally, Aim 4 will develop a future research agenda by
synthesizing findings from the CLS metrics analysis, systematic reviews, and Delphi process, culminating in
a translational report.
Led by investigators Drs. Emmanuel Oga and Jessica Cance, with foremost CLS experts, Dr. Brad Ray and
Leo Beletsky co-facilitating the HRRN CLS Workgroup, the project leverages significant expertise in harm
reduction, data harmonization, and statistical methodology. Dr. Jason Williams will lead analysis activities,
Dr. Kiersten Johnson will oversee systematic reviews, Dr. Sheila Patel will manage the Delphi process, and
Dr. Cance will coordinate dissemination efforts.
This project will provide a robust framework for integrating harm reduction strategies within CLS, addressing
policy barriers, and enhancing the effectiveness of interventions. By charting a path for future research at the
intersection of harm reduction and CLS, it aims to reduce health disparities and improve outcomes for
individuals affected by substance use and criminalization."
11106846,"ABSTRACT
For the vast majority of individuals who suffer a right hemisphere stroke, the resulting right hemisphere brain
damage (RHD) causes language production deficits that have a devastating impact on survivors’ quality of life,
making social interactions difficult, straining personal relationships, and jeopardizing employment. Output may
be acceptable at a grammatic and syntactic level, but may considered inappropriate, impolite, self-centered,
verbose, and tangential, and survivors may have difficulty understanding non-literal language and emotional
prosody rules that apply to the communication situations. Yet, despite the substantial communication challenges
faced by RHD patients, the nature of RHD communication differences and their neuroanatomic correlates
remains poorly understood. PI Jamila Minga, PhD’s long-term goal is to improve understanding, assessment,
and treatment of language production deficits in RHD survivors. The current K23 project is supported by her
preliminary work, which demonstrated that utterance-level productions are key to capturing the RHD
communication profile. The central hypothesis—that key characteristics of language production (e.g., question
types, utterance complexity, main concepts etc.) have consistent RH cortical mapping that can be used to
diagnose, measure, and monitor RHD communication impairments – addresses two critical knowledge gaps in
this underexplored scientific domain. These gaps will be evaluated by the following aims: Aim 1) Quantify the
effects of right hemisphere brain damage on language production characteristics, and Aim 2) Identify
relationships between cortical lesions of the right hemisphere and language production characteristics. The
overall objective of this K23 supplement is to support Dr. Minga’s return to full productivity, following serious
personal illness and emergency elder care responsibilities. Within one year of the parent K23 award that supports
her training, mentorship, and research, she has completed nearly 50% of data collection for both aims. The
primary research objective of this administrative supplement is to complete transcription checks, coding (Aim 1)
and lesion drawing (Aim 2) for all collected data. Funds will be used to hire additional support staff (an
undergraduate student, a speech-language pathologist, and a neuroimage analyst) to train students and to
conduct these data analytic steps for continued research progression. The resulting data and analyses will
enable future development of a diagnostic model through an anticipated R01 mechanism and a subsequent R01
to evaluate the model for clinical use. This supplemental support will facilitate the timely completion of the K23
parent project, thus ensuring the continuity of Dr. Minga’s plans to build an independent research program
developing sensitive diagnostic tools and appropriate therapeutic approaches for RHD survivors."
11109515,"The dual site Center of Innovation (COIN) for Veteran-Centered and Value-Driven Care is located at the
VA Puget Sound and Eastern Colorado Health Care Systems. Research products from our Center's 47
investigators have impacted VA policy and care delivery across a spectrum of primary, specialty and mental
healthcare services. We accomplished these impacts through partnerships with operational leaders and
application of the National Academy of Medicine's Learning Health System (LHS). We employ the LHS through
our research, implementation science, evaluation and training programs. Collectively, we help the VA become
an efficient healthcare system where best practices and new knowledge are translated into clinical care.
 Our mission is to conduct high-quality health services research that promotes Veteran-centered and value-
 driven care, generate and disseminate knowledge that contributes to the well-being of Veterans, work
collaboratively with VA policy and operational leaders to implement research finding into clinical care, and train
 the next generation of health services research leaders.
In the next 5 years, we will continue to align our programs with challenges faced by patients, providers, and the
VA health system. We have 2 research focus areas with 3 objectives embedded within each:
1. Promote Veteran-centered care and improve the patient experience across VA healthcare and
 community settings. We will accomplish the following: 1) develop methods to incorporate patient reported
 outcomes into routine clinical care and test interventions to improve these outcomes, 2) improve patient
 adherence and self-management through interventions targeting patients, providers and health systems, 3)
innovate the delivery of specialty, mental, and/or primary health care services to patients using patient-
centered approaches that bridge socioeconomic and geographic disparities.
2. Advance value-driven care by providing Veterans the highest quality care at lowest financial burden. We
 will develop new approaches to care that: 1) help the VA efficiently utilize, integrate, and coordinate health
 services received within the VA and in the community, 2) improve the quality and safety of care through
 appropriate implementation and de-implementation of healthcare services and 3) identify methods to
 improve workforce development, deployment, and provider satisfaction and well-being.
Our emerging research areas include women's health, suicide prevention, and eliminating disparities. We have
led and will continue to lead Veteran engagement efforts in research for VA nationally.
Over the past 3 years, we obtained funding for 113 projects, generated $47 million in operating revenue and
published 583 manuscripts. We trained 35 post-doctoral fellows and 12 VA and non-VA career development
awardees. Our investigators were awarded the HSR&D best paper awards in 2015 and 2016. Our work has
been recognized by national media, presented to Congress, resulted in legislation, designated as VA promising
practices for broad dissemination, and informed both VA-wide health services improvements and CMS policy.
Drs. David Au (in Seattle) and P. Michael Ho (in Denver) will continue as co-Directors along with Associate
Directors, Drs. Steven Zeliadt (Seattle) and Cari Levy (Denver). Collectively, they have worked together for
more than 10 years, are outstanding researchers and have experience leading complex organizations.
Our Center excels in engaging operational partners including the Offices of Patient-Centered Care and Cultural
Transformation; Rural Health; Primary Care; Specialty Care; and Veterans Access to Care. Research products
strategically address VA operational and VA Secretary priorities. We work closely with the Universities of
Washington and Colorado, where all our investigators serve as faculty. Further, we have strong ties with our
respective medical centers, VISNs, and partners outside VA including NIH, CDC, and Kaiser Permanente."
11109545,"The goal of the Durham Center of Innovation to Accelerate Discovery and Practice Transformation
(ADAPT) is to enhance the Veterans Health Administration’s (VHA) ability to continually improve health care
and optimize Veteran wellbeing and independence. We approach this goal by generating and applying
evidence to spur innovation in health care organization, finance, and delivery for Veterans and their families. In
its 35-year history, Durham’s Health Services Research and Development Center, now named ADAPT, has
conducted hundreds of policy-relevant studies influencing Veterans’ health care, trained 143 physician and
postdoctoral fellows, and supported 32 VA Career Development Awardees. Comprising a large group of
experienced investigators nested within a mature research infrastructure, ADAPT is ideally suited to continue
to provide scientific leadership across the continuum from basic health services to implementation research. In
this way, we will play a vital role in helping VHA meet the challenges of providing timely, coordinated,
consistently high-quality care to more than 9 million Veterans each year.
 While proud of our track record, we recognize that new methods and models are required to meet the ever-
changing needs of VHA and our Veterans, who experience a disproportionately high burden of disease related
to poor health behaviors and other clinical and social factors, face challenges to accessing health care, and
have greater need of long-term care services and supports than at any time in history. Based on a 1-year
planning process involving extensive input from VHA leadership and other stakeholders, and drawing from the
World Health Organization’s conceptual framework of resilient, or adaptive, health care systems, we have
selected 3 focused areas of research for the next 5 years that align with VA strategic priorities: (1) promoting
and sustaining healthy behaviors; (2) enhancing access through virtual care; and (3) optimizing function
and independence. We have formed investigator teams to focus on each priority area in close collaboration
with health system partners. Each team will support a portfolio of externally funded projects, catalyze new
ideas through pilot studies and grant development workshops, provide intellectual leadership in the larger
research community, and be a national resource to inform VA clinical care and policy decisions. To continue
our longstanding commitment to training and career development, each research area will also attract and
support promising junior investigators and provide individual mentorship to foster their scientific development.
 Scientific rigor, an essential underpinning of the work to be done in each research focus area, will be
reinforced and advanced by the formation of 3 cross-cutting methods labs: 1) the Pragmatic Clinical Trials Lab
will facilitate application of methods to evaluate effectiveness of interventions in real-life routine practice
conditions; 2) the Non-Randomized Design Lab will support rigorous application of causal inference methods in
observational studies and integration of novel data sources; and 3) our successful Implementation Lab will be
expanded to incorporate Improvement Science. To ensure that research studies are designed to address VA’s
highest priorities and that research findings are relevant and actionable, we will strengthen existing
partnerships with VA stakeholders and foster new ones in all phases of research development, dissemination,
and translation.
 ADAPT’s leadership team will direct all activities, ensuring integration across research focus areas and
methods labs. Our aims for the next 5 years include: 1) catalyzing innovative health services research in health
behaviors, virtual care, and function/independence; 2) advancing state-of-the-art methods to accelerate
research discoveries; 3) translating research findings into practice transformation throughout VHA; and 4)
training the next generation of researchers who will become leaders in VA research. ADAPT will amplify the
impact of our individual investigators and meaningfully enhance VHA’s ability to care for our nation’s Veterans."

hashing”-based sample multiplexing strategy and a single-cell genomic readout. This platform will allow for the
simultaneous molecular description of 1,000s-10,000s of unique conditions (i.e. gene and exposure
combinations) at the resolution of individual cell types and cell states. In addition, we propose to develop a set
of tools based on heterologous viral receptor expression for the in situ and cell-type specific delivery of CRISPR-
based genetic perturbations in a manner compatible with single-cell RNA-seq. We highlight the versatility and
generalizability of our approach across three applications of our technologies that aim to define gene-by-
environment interactions in neurobiological disease. We propose to dissect the genetic interactions between
mutations associated with Alzheimer’s disease and the transcriptional response of neural cell types to oxidative
stress and peptide aggregates; to characterize the transcriptional effects associated with cell-type specific
modulation of genetic modifier activity in response to mutations in genes that cause epilepsy disorder and; to
determine how genes that are commonly mutated in brain cancer alter the response of murine tumors to
therapies in vivo. Our goal is to arrive at clinically actionable molecular descriptions of how individual genes
contribute to the response of individuals to exposure."
10870277,"Flame retardants (FRs) are a ubiquitous group of chemicals used in furniture, car seats, and children's products
and can leach into indoor dust, resulting in chronic exposures. Epidemiological and experimental evidence shows
that developmental FR exposures result in short- and long-term adverse health outcomes, but the knowledge
gap remains- what targets do they attack and how do they drive adverse outcomes? Using zebrafish, our
preliminary data on a brominated FR, tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) shows that TBBPA exposures during
early developmental windows (cleavage, blastula, early gastrula) results in developmental delays, mortality and
downstream defects in dorsoventral patterning. These early windows are marked by a rapid maternal to zygotic
transition (MZT) and zygotic genome activation (ZGA) when maternally loaded mRNA degrade, and zygotic
genome is activated. Our mRNA-sequencing data reveals that TBBPA inhibits ZGA and targets chromatin
remodeling. Since the latter process is regulated by histone acetylation H3K27ac and catalyzed by P300 protein,
we used a P300 activator CfPB and showed that co-exposures with TBBPA and P300 activator mitigated the
TBBPA-induced phenotypes. Molecular docking showed strong binding affinities between TBBPA and P300.
Based on these, our overarching goal is to understand the diversity ofTBBPA-induced epigenetic and genetic
modifications and how they modulate embryonic development. Our oldective is to determine how TBBPA
disrupts ZGA through histone modifiers and the downstream consequences on chromatin remodeling and gene
expression. The central hypothesis is that TBBPA inhibits P300 activity and limits zygotic transcription by
inhibiting H3K27 acetylation and chromatin remodeling of zygotic genome. This hypothesis will be tested
through two specific aims. Within aim 1, we will conduct P300 activity assays and quantify of global and genelevel
H3K27ac using Western Blots and ChIP-seq. In aim 2, we will use ATAC-seq and nascent RNA-seq to
examine chromatin accessibility and nascent RNA transcription. We will also integrate the multiome data from
both aims into a gene regulatory model for systems level analyses of pathways that are impacted by TBBPA
during ZGA. Based on the sequencing outcomes, we will select specific targets and use qPCR to quantify gene
expression across environmentally relevant TBBPA concentrations. The grant is innovative, since it is the first
work to systemically assess how an environmental toxicant impacts ZGA through histone modifications and
leverages state of the art technologies, including nascent RNA seq, to describe a novel adverse outcome pathway
(AOP) for TBBPA early life exposures that spans multiple biological levels from epigenetic regulation
(acetylation), chromatin biology, co-regulated genes, signaling networks and organism development. The work
is significant since it will reveal how TBBPA directly or indirectly targets proteins or gene products and their
regulatory regions that modify onset of zygotic transcription and can be further used in mechanistic or
epidemiological studies to evaluate disease mechanisms.
Project Summary/Abstract"
10989460,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri is responsible for severe primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM),
which mostly occurs in healthy children and young adults. N. fowleri is considered as one of the deadliest human
pathogens and is a category B biodefence agent. N. fowleri infection is problematic due to the rapid onset and
destructive nature of the disease as well as the lack of effective treatments. Currently, there is no single. proven.
evidence-based treatment with a high probability of cure. Disruption of sterol biosynthesis in N. fowleri by smallmolecule
inhibitors may be an effective intervention strategy against fatal amoebic meningoencephalitis. In the
preliminary studies, we pharmacologically validated N. fowleri CYP51 (NfCYP51) as a potential therapeutic
target. An intrinsic difficulty in achieving anti-Naegleria effect in vivo is that a drug must cross the blood-brain
barrier (BBB) to reach the site of action. Limited brain permeability of drugs targeting CYP51 in pathogenic fungi
prevents them from being efficacious in the treatment of PAM. The goal of our proposal is to develop brainpenetrant
bona fide CYP51 inhibitors with anti-Naegleria activity and deploy them as the predecessors offuture
anti-PAM therapeutics. To achieve this goal, we assembled an interdisciplinary team of investigators with
expertise in N. fowleri biology (Debnath, Pl), computational chemistry (Brancale, Co-I), and medicinal chemistry
for CNS applications (Ballatore, Co-I). In our preliminary studies, we selected compounds possessing
physicochemical parameters compatible with BBB permeability. We identified small-molecule hits that are
characterized by the presence of a carboxylate ester moiety which, in vivo, is rapidly hydrolyzed. A follow up
study with hydrolytically more stable ether analogs identified two compounds with improved NfCYP51 binding
and potency. The in vivo assessment confirmed detection of these two ether analogs in brain tissue. The primary
objectives of this application are further evaluation of one BBB permeable ether congener for in vivo efficacy and
the design, synthesis, and evaluation of congeners with the carbonyl group isosterically replaced with the 4-
membered ring heterocycles, oxetane, thietane or their derivatives, that render compounds more resistant to
chemical and enzymatic hydrolysis. Studies in Aim 1A include iterative cycles of design and synthesis of the
analogs that, based on our current understanding of the structure-activity and structure-property relationships
(SARISPR), are expected to exhibit both anti-N. fowleri activity and favorable ADME-PK. Studies in Aim 1 B will
validate the newly synthesized compounds in a cascade of in vitro and in vivo assays for physicochemical
properties (pKa, logP, log074), aqueous solubility, hydrolytic stability in buffers and plasma, potency, cytotoxicity,
BBB permeability, metabolic stability and brain and plasma PK. Two compounds satisfying all go-no-go criteria
will progress to tolerability and proof-of-concept efficacy studies in a mouse model of PAM in Aim 2. We expect
to identify a lead compound that significantly extends the lifespan of the infected animals beyond that of the
current standard of care, Amphotericin B."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-
24-041 and as a supplement to the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center
(AHWFBCCC) National Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant (P30 CA012197, Ruben Mesa, PI). The
AHWFBCCC catchment area includes 30 counties across central and western North Carolina and northwest
South Carolina. It includes 4.8 million residents, about one-third racial/ethnic minority, and a significant rural
footprint. This project will contribute to the broader goal of AHWFBCCC’s Community Outreach and Engagement
efforts and survivorship is one of the P30’s five main strategic priorities that represents the intersection between
the Cancer Center’s science and the community it serves. This NOSI calls for assessing and enhancing
survivorship care in accordance with the National Standards for Survivorship Care that were established after
the P30 was awarded. It will take intentional strategies to successfully implement these new standards into
existing clinical care. Implementation varies greatly depending on contextual factors. Indeed, a recent overview
of systematic reviews of survivorship care highlighted the importance of considering care contexts when
designing the most appropriate model to improve outcomes and efficiency. Further, there is also a gap in
understanding what care models are effective in diverse populations (e.g., by race/ethnicity, geographic location).
We propose conducting an adapted action planning process consisting of two overarching phases with a three
level structure including quantitative and qualitative analysis; micro (e.g. patients), meso (e.g. clinics), and macro
(e.g. organizational). For phase one, we will evaluate the extent to which survivorship care programs in a
multidimensional health care system align with recently developed National Standards for Survivorship Care
through a mixed-methods approach. We will review existing data, engage a Survivorship Insights Council,
administer an electronic survey across all practices, and conduct clinic observations and stakeholder interviews
with four representative practices. For the second phase, we aim to expand efforts to contextualize current
cancer survivorship care by identifying barriers, gap areas, and facilitators to inform future adaptation and
implementation of optimized survivorship care. This will include analyzing the new qualitative and quantitative
data, convening stakeholders to prioritize next steps, seeking advice from the existing AHWFBCCC Community
Advisory Board, summarizing results based on the shared goals of the sites, and developing an implementation
planning toolkit needed for expanding this systematic action planning process across more clinics. Establishing
a systematic process for assessing and improving accessible survivorship care with a balance of having both
common unified services and enough variation to be tailored to local demands will position AHWFBCCC to
contribute to a broader understanding of optimally effective survivorship care models in diverse populations."

11107781,"Project Summary:
Kennedy’s disease, also known as spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), is a progressive
neurodegenerative disease caused by genetic polyglutamine copies in the N-terminal domain
(NTD) of the androgen receptor (AR). Recent research has shown that the mutant AR protein
misfolds, aggregates, and abnormally interacts with other proteins, leading to androgen dependent
lower motor neuron degeneration and skeletal muscle atrophy. Currently, there are no treatments
available to slow, stop or even reverse the progression of SBMA; therefore, the unmet medical need
is high to discover novel therapeutic agents against the disease. Experimental studies for the
treatment of SBMA have focused on interaction of the AR with testosterone. Removing
testosterone via castration in animal models appears to be protective and restores some lost
function. AR knockout in SBMA patient-derived stem cells differentiated into neurons reverses the
neurotoxic effects of the mutant AR.
These findings have led to the use of anti-androgenic therapies for SBMA treatment. Our awarded
Phase 1 SBIR grant to evaluate our NTD-binding selective AR antagonists and degraders (DAARIs) in
preclinical models of SBMA and our Phase 2 SBIR grant have generated strong in vitro and in vivo
data, and preclinical manufacturing development to progress the development of ONCT-505 as a
potential SBMA therapy.
Our objective is to generate specific data for ONCT-505, described below, that will ultimately
support the submission of an investigational new drug (IND)-application. ONCT-505 has been
studied in various preclinical models of AR-dependent diseases, including SBMA and advanced
prostate cancer. Importantly, ONCT-505, unlike any other molecule targeting the AR, binds to the
AR activation function-1 (AF-1) domain in the NTD and leads to signaling antagonism and ultimately
AR protein degradation via ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. ONCT-505 is orally bioavailable with
pharmacokinetic (PK) and drug-like properties suitable for drug development and demonstrated
efficacy in SBMA preclinical models better than surgical castration. The molecule did not show
overt toxicity up to 200 times the ED50 (effective dose of 50% observed efficacy) in pilot toxicology
studies and also lacks cross reactivity with other proteins. These properties make ONCT-505 an
ideal candidate for further evaluation as potential small molecule therapeutic for patients suffering
from SBMA.
Successful completion of the outlined studies will result in a clinical drug candidate with
demonstrated preclinical efficacy, well-documented safety profile, and scalable GMP-compatible
manufacturing process."
11108899,"Abstract:
Language disorders afflict 6 to 8 million people in the United States. One common symptom in language
disorders is difficulty comprehending the grammatical structure of sentences. Understanding that the sentence
“The car at the stoplight is blue” refers to a blue car requires recognizing “at the stoplight” as a distinct phrase
that modifies the preceding noun phrase “the car”. People with grammatical comprehension disorders have
difficulty with this. With intracranial recordings in human neurosurgical patient volunteers with normal
language function we previously described the patterns of phrase-structure building in neural activity observed
in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and superior temporal sulcus (STS). This is hypothesized to play a causal
role in the comprehension of sentence structure, but such a role has never been demonstrated. Aim 1 will test
this hypothesis by directly electrically stimulating and thus transiently disrupting the left IFG and STS of
neurosurgical patient volunteers at key phrasal boundaries in a sentence and observing how this affects
sentence comprehension accuracy. Aim 2 will investigate a direct link between neural activity and the resulting
behavior for each trial using a self-paced reading task while we record neural activity directly from key
language network sites, specifically the left IFG and STS. We will correlate neural activity with per-word
reaction times, which reflect the processing requirements for each word. Also, for the experiments in Aim 1 we
will simultaneously record activity from one language network area (IFG or STS) while stimulating the other
area to demonstrate how disrupting each area affects activity elsewhere in the language network. Altogether,
we expect that disrupting fronto-temporal phrase-merging activity will reliably create comprehension errors,
and that this neural activity will be tied to behavioral markers of phrase processing and affected by the
intracranial stimulation in a way that we can predict given the result that the stimulation has on behavior. Our
team is uniquely qualified to accomplish these aims. This proposal will provide me with training in the
technique of intracranial stimulation with simultaneous recording in human patient volunteers performing a
task, in deepening my understanding of theoretical linguistics through formal instruction and mentoring, and in
communication disorders, specifically aphasia. In summary, the proposed studies and training plan will lead to
a better understanding of grammatical deficits in language disorders, leading to improved treatments and
interventions, and will expand my impact as a neuroscientist, serving as a bridge to independent funding."
11109055,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Institute of Medicine’s report on “The health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and transgender People,” called for
NIH-supported research to address the methodological challenges that have impeded research on the health
of transgender people – specifically, to improve strategies for reaching, larger, more diverse samples of
transgender persons in the United States. Historically, research on sexual and reproductive health (SRH) has
excluded or misclassified transgender, nonbinary, and intersex (TNBI) people due to presumptions that
pregnancy and related outcomes can be experienced solely by cisgender women. However, TNBI people plan
for and carry pregnancies, and thus require high-quality and evidence-based healthcare. Despite this need,
existing data on the SRH needs of TNBI populations primarily come from convenience samples-- small in size
and/or limited in geographic scope. The dearth of representative data has meant, critically, that SRH providers
do not have adequate evidence upon which to rely to ensure that the SRH needs of their TNBI patients are met
within existing healthcare services--thereby contributing to lower quality care and SRH disparities among these
populations. And while data on transgender and nonbinary people are scarce, data on intersex people are
even scarcer. Consequently, this study aims to test methods of improving the research participation, retention,
and quality of collected data among TNBI people in the United States. The specific aims include: (1) recruit a
large, diverse sample of TNBI people from across the United States, (2) collect longitudinal data on core SRH
outcomes, and (3) improve retention and data quality among TNBI participants in SRH research as compared
to standard methods. To achieve these aims, we will implement a four-arm, parallel design, randomized control
trial that randomizes participants to receipt of zero, one, or two novel survey features in their online survey: a
gender-inclusive anatomical organ inventory for screening into survey logic, and/or customizable survey
language to personalize their survey experience. The control group will be randomized to screening based on
a 2-part gender identity question, and use of standard medical terms. The research will address challenges
encountered in previous SRH research with TNBI populations and will contribute to the evidence around best
practices for data collection with other populations historically characterized as “hard-to-reach” in the context of
SRH, public health research, and clinical care. The evidence generated by this study could have wide-ranging
impacts—including refined determination of research and clinical care eligibility, improved research
participation, and better healthcare screening and treatment for TNBI populations. Beyond SRH and advancing
the evidence-based for TNBI people, this novel survey methodologies tested in this study could be applied
broadly to advance public health research approaches and improve the accuracy and relevance of data
collection with a diverse range of populations and topics."
11098988,"Neuroscience has been able to gain major insights by relating measurements of neural activity to the
 brain’s sensory inputs and motor outputs. Yet most neural activity supports computations and cognitive
functions (‘thoughts’) that are not directly measurable by the experimenter. The investigators for the
 present proposal invented a novel method to model an animal's thoughts by combining eXplainable
 Artificial Intelligence (XAI) cognitive models for naturalistic tasks with measurements of the animal’s
 sensory inputs and behavioral outputs. This model, called Inverse Rational Control (IRC), infers the
internal model assumptions under which an animal's actions would be optimal. It then provides estimates
of time series of subjective beliefs about the world that are consistent with this internal model. These
estimates provide targets for a dimensionality reduction framework that assesses task-relevant
 computational dynamics within neural population activity. The investigators propose to use these analysis
 tools to find neural representations and transformations that implement these cognitive processes. They
will apply this to a complex, naturalistic task that they developed: catching fireflies in virtual reality. The
 monkeys they successfully trained to perform this task demonstrably weigh uncertainty, develop
 predictions and long-term strategies, and apply nonlinear dynamics — all computations that are
 fundamental for brain function. The investigators propose first to apply their method to analyze existing
behavioral data and neural recordings collected in a simple version of this task with a single target firefly.
 They will then collect new data on a multi-firefly version of the task, which incentivizes animals to make
and implement longer-term plans. To analyze this data, the investigators will generalize their approach to
 allow them to learn which compressed representations are selected by the animal as the foundation for
 their strategies. These results will be used to form predictions about neural computations that will be
tested using the electrophysiological data collected from multiple brain regions during this project. The
 results of this study will explain the computations required to perform a complex, strategic navigation task
 in the presence of uncertainty, and will demonstrate a new paradigm for understanding naturalistic brain
computations.
RELEVANCE (See instructions):
 This project will uncover the neural basis of cognitive processes in the primate brain that underlie spatial
 navigation, strategic planning, and behavioral control. It will demonstrate how a powerful new paradigm
 for understanding complex, natural brain computations can apply to a wide variety of tasks, to explain
 either adaptive or pathologically structured behavior. This will provide crucial guidance for understanding
 and improving disrupted human cognitive function."
11105281,"Abstract
 Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a life-threatening disorder caused by an autoreactive T-cell mediated
destruction of hematopoietic stem cells resulting in the inability to produce adequate red blood cells, white blood
cells and platelets. Acquired AA is extremely rare, occurring in 2-6 patients per million. There are between 600-
900 new cases each year in the United States. While AA can occur at any age there is a bi-modal distribution
with peaks in late childhood/early adolescence and in older adults. Patients with AA are susceptible to potentially
fatal opportunistic infections, clonal hematopoiesis/leukemogenesis, and chronic transfusion burden.
 The workup of a patient with suspected AA takes several weeks during which time the patient receives
only supportive care. Immune suppression therapy (IST) and bone marrow transplant (BMT) are the two
therapies available for patients once a diagnosis is definitive. For patients with an available matched related
donor (MRD), BMT is the standard of care (SOC). Patients lacking a MRD traditionally received IST although
many institutions are now prioritizing alternative donor transplant. IST has a 50% response rate over time with
the other half of patients requiring additional therapy. BMT has a higher disease-free survival rate but increased
potential toxicities including graft versus host disease, infertility and graft rejection. The decision of which therapy
to pursue is often the most anxiety-provoking time for families with children that have newly diagnosed AA.
 This Phase 2a/2b Trial Emapalumab: A Window of Opportunity in Pediatric Aplastic Anemia leverages
data showing that the Interferon-gamma (IFNγ) pathway is associated with the pathogenesis of AA. Pediatric
patients with newly diagnosed AA will receive a prophase of an IFNγ neutralizing monoclonal antibody called
emapalumab. This prophase will not add time to curative therapy and will occur during the workup period
between presentation and start of definitive therapy. At the conclusion of the prophase, patients that have a
hematologic response will be consolidated with IST while those that do not will receive institutional SOC. In this
way we create an algorithm to try and identify patients that are most likely to have a favorable response to IST.
This data-driven identification of which patient should receive IST will help alleviate parental anxiety in making
these decisions without sufficient information.
 Aim 2 of this project seeks to extend our previous findings that distinct patterns of pediatric clonal
hematopoiesis are associated with poor outcomes after IST. Conversely, lack of these markers aligned with
favorable IST responses. We will prospectively validate these findings and assess if these specific clonal
changes can be used as predictive biomarkers for response to IST. We will also examine if an early upfront
prophase with emapalumab can prevent and/or minimize emergence of clonal hematopoiesis by preserving
larger reservoirs of hematopoietic stem cells. By combining the data from these two aims, we hope to provide
an algorithm to identify pediatric patients with aplastic anemia that are most likely to be cured by IST."
11105727,"Abstract
Retinoblastoma (RB) is a micro-orphan disease intraocular cancer in infants and children (typically diagnosed
between birth and 5 years of age). Approximately 250 new cases are diagnosed annually in the United States.
Standard of care for retinoblastoma includes removing the affected eye (safest) or attempted salvage of the eye
starting with systemic or intra-arterial chemotherapy. Since external beam radiotherapy incurs life-long high risk of
second cancers in RB H1 patients carrying the RB1 cancer predisposition gene, it is reserved for last effort to save
a last eye. There is no FDA approved intervention for retinoblastoma. Topotecan Chemoplaque (IND #112785) as
a single (one) treatment achieves sustained local six-week delivery of Topotecan directly to the interior of the eye
while sequestering Topotecan from washout to peripheral circulation. The RP2D was determined to be 2 doses: 0.9
mg (single Chemoplaque) or 1.2 mg (two 0.6 mg Chemoplaques), depending on patient age and tumor features.
Sustained CR (absence of Standard of Care therapies after the Chemoplaque) was achieved in 10/12, 0.9 mg,
83% and 8/9, 1.2 mg, 89% evaluable for efficacy.
In the 1.2 mg dose that we plan to progress in the proposed trial, the sustained CR rate is 89%. All the CRs are
out > 2 years. All the CRs were in refractory settings, including refractory solid tumor, refractory vitreous seeds,
and refractory subretinal seeds. At the RP2D based on swimmer plot analysis, for patients that were refractory to
IAC, treatments before and after Chemoplaque are as follows:
As such, the Chemoplaque significantly reduces subsequent treatment burden in patients refractory to IAC.
Toxicity analysis includes 22 participants treated at the RPD2 (12, 0.9 mg /10, 1.2 mg).
No systemic toxicity was observed. At all time points, plasma Topotecan levels were below limits of detection
except one trace (<1 ng/ml detection only on day 1 in the smallest child). Vitritis/scleritis developed in 2
participants after 4 weeks (1/12 at 0.9 dose, and 1/10 at 1.2 dose), which responded to local steroids with resulting
sustained CRs (now out > 2 years). All eyes have a full thickness chorio-retinal scar directly opposite the
Chemoplaque. All participants reported signs of inflammation and reduced well-being, similar to babies teething
that resolves in all cases following Chemoplaque removal and (if applied) is responsive to local steroids. The
Phase I Trial RP2D analysis suggests that Topotecan Chemoplaque has good, sustained effectiveness in refractory
settings including refractory solid tumor, refractory vitreous and subretinal seeds—given as a single application
(one treatment) without need for repeat treatment or multiple cycles. To our knowledge, there are no
retinoblastoma interventions that are effective (result in CRs) after a single application, and further, there are none
that are effective across all lesion types let alone as a single application. The chemoplaque has demonstrated
robust activity across all lesions as a one-time treatment with no systemic toxicity.
This FDA Orphan Drug Grant application requests support for Expansion Phase II clinical trial of Topotecan
Chemoplaque at the 1.2 mg RP2D dose. EUAs will follow standard of care at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. In the
proposed study, we will enhance study of impact beyond Progression-free Survival by quantitating invasiveness of
subsequent therapies, extending the Swimmer RB analysis. The Topotecan Chemoplaque has potential to be the
first FDA-approved therapy for this micro-orphan childhood disease and offer simple treatment—important in low
resource settings where the majority of RB children live.
The efficacy and safety of the RP2D (1.2 mg) Chemoplaque in refractory disease addresses a critical need
(provides an alternative to radiation and life-long increased risk of secondary cancers) providing an important
addition to the armamentarium of RB interventions."

In summary, TOFMS will increase research capacities and enhance the new research
opportunities in the region. The student in degree program in Pharmaceutical Sciences and
other biomedical related area will benefit from a hand on research-based education from this
instrument, and that will contribute to our institutional mission in increasing the talent pool from
underrepresented minority on which the U.S. biomedical research enterprise can draw.
Project Summary/Abstract"
11110601,"Summary
Some of the most debilitating and detrimental aspects of serious mental illnesses (SMI) are the 1) social isolation
(low numbers of social contacts) and 2) the subjective experiences of social disconnection (loneliness) that
frequently accompany these conditions. Social isolation and loneliness have an immense impact on day-to-day
functioning in SMI and are associated with an overall poor quality of life and early mortality. Currently there are
no available interventions that can prevent or reverse these devastating consequences of SMI. This may be in
part because the underlying neural and psychological mechanisms of social isolation and loneliness in SMI are
poorly understood. However, recent clues from studies employing advanced neuroimaging and digital
assessment approaches can provide the basis for a new approach to investigating such mechanisms. Prior work
has indicated that objective isolation and loneliness are correlated but also somewhat independent. Recent
neuroimaging findings support this model, revealing that social isolation and loneliness have both shared and
distinct neural correlates. However, it is also clear that these are not static phenomena; smartphone-based
assessments have revealed transient, dynamic changes in social isolation and loneliness. Individual differences
in the anticipation of rejection are associated with momentary experiences of loneliness, greater avoidance and
subsequent increases in social isolation. Thus, in the current proposal, we plan to comprehensively measure
both the relatively stable neural and behavioral predictors of social isolation and loneliness, as well as the
moment-to-moment changes in these experiences, in 60 individuals with SMI and 60 without SMI. In Aim 1 of
the proposed project, we will show that the higher levels of social isolation and loneliness in SMI are linked to
shared and distinct neural responses to social stimuli, with lower responses of social perception-related circuitry
(medial temporal lobe regions) linked to social isolation, and lower responses of reward-related circuitry (basal
ganglia regions) linked to loneliness. In Aim 2, we will measure transient changes in social isolation and
loneliness with smartphone assessments using a longitudinal “burst” design. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will determine
how the correlates of social isolation and loneliness identified in Aims 1 and 2 are linked to each other and to
levels of functioning, and measure the stability of these associations over time. Therefore, in this project, we plan
to demonstrate that fundamental neural and behavioral processes drive momentary variation in the experience
of social isolation and loneliness, and directly impact functioning and quality of life in SMI. In follow-up work,
these findings can be used as quantitative targets in studies of novel interventions which aim to address these
major causes of disability and early mortality."

More than 1.2 million people in the United States have a spinal cord injury (SCI), and each year there are 10,000
new cases. In the last few years, we have shown that neuromodulation using epidural stimulation of the
lumbosacral spinal cord can activate latent neural circuits and restore voluntary movement, standing and
stepping in individuals with chronic SCI. One participant in this study also reported gains in bladder function
following training with spinal cord epidural stimulation. However, there are persistent gaps that need to be filled
in order to advance the field of neuromodulation forward. Technological advances to upgrade the stimulator’s
programming and wireless communication platforms are critically needed in order to integrate multiple training
paradigms across multiple systems (i.e. motor and autonomic), as well as take advantage of wireless monitoring
technology that could improve the patient experience. For this study, first we will acquire data necessary for the
implementation of learning algorithms and closed-loop systems with the implanted neurostimulator. Second, 8
additional individuals will be randomized into training interventions for locomotion and bladder. The purpose of
this phase is to implement the closed-loop controls and learning algorithms developed with data from phase 1.
This two phase design will allow us to acquire necessary data for the development of technical tools with a group
of 8 individuals, and test the closed-loop controls with a second group of individuals that have not received prior
to training. This trial will upgrade technology for epidural stimulation and make it specific for use by individuals
with spinal cord injury."
11099407,"STUDY SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
The cardiovascular research community has established strong correlations between the plasma
concentrations of atherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins (apoB-Lps) and the clinical risk of cardiovascular
disease (CVD). More detailed analyses are now uncovering additional predictors of risk for CVD within these
particles (e.g., the content of apoC3 and ceramides). The goal of this study is to incorporate bioinformatics/
biostatistics analytic approaches on novel lipidomic and proteomic targets to draw correlations to
cardiometabolic markers. Samples from the parent grant provide internal data sources and analytes for data
curation and analysis, specifically non-parametric modeling, and Spearman partial correlation. The use of a
robust measurement tool for novel lipidomic and proteomic metrics presents promising outcomes for
translational research. In the realm of population health, the understanding of confounding through frequency
counts will help in accounting for spurious associations for obesity pharmacotherapy in New York sampled
bariatric surgery populations. Additionally, these relationships can be properly conditioned after being
identified. For aim 1, persistent significance and network analysis will be included. For aim 2, a parametric
approach will be taken with significance testing and an alpha of 0.05. Regular communication with C2 core
members and monthly PPG meetings will be attended to keep track of progression."
11110754,"Project Summary/Abstract
Adverse events associated with injectable medications are estimated to impact millions of hospitalizations
annually with billions of dollars in associated costs and thousands of deaths. Drug administration errors are
the most frequently reported critical incidents in anesthesia with error rates for drug delivery events as high as
5-10% of all drugs given. Accidentally selecting the wrong syringe or vial, or giving an incorrect dose, are
common drug errors. Multiple solutions have been suggested to decrease these errors, however, most
solutions require additional steps prior to drug administration and provider compliance can be problematic. A
real-time auditory or visual feedback system that detects syringe handling by an anesthesia provider could
provide a virtual second set of eyes to check medications before mistakes occur.
This proposal seeks to obtain head-mounted high resolution video footage of anesthesiology providers.
Computer vision algorithms will be developed to identify syringes and vials in real-time. The central
hypothesis of this work is that machine learning algorithms operating from images obtained from a power
efficient camera can accurately identify medications before they are given to patients in the operating room and
generate an electronic medical record which is at least as accurate as current, manually generated tools. (1)
Determine reliability of drug label identification using machine learning tools. Build a database of 7,500-
15,000 syringe handling events obtained from head mounted cameras on 30 providers at two hospitals and
build real time machine learning algorithms to identify syringes, vials, and labels of commonly used anesthesia
medications optimized for timely, accurate identification. (2) Assess accuracy of automated drug delivery
dose calculations. Build volume analysis software to determine the volume of a drug administered as well as
identify the drug concentration to calculate dose. Compare timing and dosages from the manually produced
clinical record to those determined from the computer vision algorithm using the video footage as the true
value to determine the accuracy of each modality. (3) Design and test the feasibility of a power efficient
real-time wearable camera system. A low-cost camera system optimized for all day use with real-time
analysis capabilities will be constructed including two separate cameras, one low and one high resolution to
minimize battery consumption and thus overall device size and weight, recording in high resolution only when
the low-resolution camera detects syringe handling.
Through this K08 award the candidate will learn skills needed to be a leading expert in computer vision,
specifically, as it can be applied to patient safety in anesthesiology."
11121546,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Our long term goal is to identify and understand the mechanisms underlying plasticity in visual
stimulus detection and visually-guided pursuit. Plasticity in these visuospatial orienting behaviors
are perturbed in both neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism as well as neurological
disorders resulting from traumatic experiences such as PTSD. Thus, development and plasticity
of these visual orienting behaviors critically impact healthy visual processing. In order to
ultimately develop targeted therapies that alleviate the specific visual processing deficits
associated with each disorder, it is necessary to first understand the mechanisms that underlie
the development and plasticity of visual stimulus detection and pursuit behaviors more
fundamentally. We will start to address this critical gap by investigating the development and
sensory experience-dependent plasticity of function of specific cell types of the superior colliculus
in the mouse as they relate to specific changes in visual stimulus detection and pursuit behavior.
The superior colliculus is a key subcortical visual system that processes salient environmental
stimuli, receives substantial input from cortex and mediates rapid spatial orienting behavior in all
mammals. The function of cells in this structure are sensitive to visual experience and change
significantly over development, and, two classes of cells in the superior colliculus known as the
wide- and narrow-field vertical neurons specifically underlie visual stimulus detection and pursuit.
However, we do not understand how these precise neural circuits are directly impacted by visual
experience throughout life. The mouse affords access to a broad range of sophisticatedgenetic
tools that may be used to close this gap in our understanding. In AIM 1, we will quantify stimulus
detection and pursuit behaviors at key developmental stages from postnatal day 21 to adulthood
to understand how these visual orienting behaviors change in the mouse. In AIM 2, we will
determine whether specific circuit changes support developmental changes in behavior by quantifying
the neural encoding of visual stimuli specifically in the wide- and narrow-field cell circuits of the
superior colliculus in the behaving animal. We will measure specific neural activity using high-
density in vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics, virus mediated circuit tracing, calcium imaging
and functional ultrasound imaging. In AIM 3, we will study the experience-dependent
development of both behavior and specific circuit function in the superior colliculus by
manipulating visual experience by allowing mice to hunt live insects (enrichment). Overall, this
work will advance our understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying successful
spatial orienting behaviors that are essential for visual perception."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as ""NOT-CA-
24-041”. This proposal aims to investigate the level of alignment between the survivorship services provided by
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (FHCC) and the National Standards for Survivorship Care, and to assess
the current status of survivorship care at FHCC for patients diagnosed with cancer as adolescents or young
adults (AYA, ages 15-39 yrs). We will determine the utilization rates and barriers or facilitators to receiving
survivorship care among AYA survivors who were eligible for the parent grant (U01 CA246659). The parent
grant focuses on AYA survivors and tests the INSPIRE–Adolescent and Young Adult program, which
incorporates a mobile app/website and telehealth care to reduce distress and improve healthcare adherence
among AYA survivors across five US centers. The proposed supplement aims to expand the assessment of
survivorship care beyond distress and adherence, evaluating survivorship care comprehensively. This proposal
includes a mixed-methods design. The first aim will compare the alignment of current survivorship services
with the National Standards for Cancer Survivorship Care. The second aim will examine utilization rates of the
Survivorship Clinic and supportive care services for those AYA survivors who were screened and determined to
be eligible to participate in the parent grant. The third aim will approach a subset of AYA survivors who have
agreed to further contact (95% of them have agreed) to perform a qualitative study using semi-structured
interviews to assess barriers and facilitators to attending the Survivorship Clinic and/or receipt of survivorship
focused supportive care services. This data generated from this administrative supplement will offer the
opportunity to comprehensively examine the current state of survivorship care service being provided to a
generally underserved population of cancer survivors—those diagnosed and treated as AYAs. Gaps in
meeting national standards and barriers identified during the qualitative interviews will be brought forth to
Cancer Center leadership so that efforts to enhance care delivery can be implemented with a goal that all AYA
survivors have the opportunity to receive care that is concordant with national standards so that that their late
and long-term physical, financial, social and emotional needs can be met, and strategies can be implemented
to reduce barriers. Additionally, the findings will be disseminated to advance survivorship care practices at
other cancer centers."

 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adverse auditory environments in indoor spaces present constant challenges to children during everyday
learning and social interactions. Spatial hearing provides access to auditory cues that promote auditory and
speech perception in these difficult listening situations. However, auditory spatial cues are distorted in most
indoor spaces due to reverberation—the excessive sound energy reflected from room surfaces arriving at the
listener shortly after the initial sound directly from the source. The perceptual consequences of reverberation on
spatial hearing have not been characterized in children with normal hearing, leaving a critical gap in our
knowledge of benchmark abilities to assess hearing device fitting outcomes for children with hearing loss during
real-world listening.
In the proposed work, our goal is to reveal the developmental trajectories of functional spatial hearing abilities
under realistic reverberation between 6- to 18-year-old children. This age range reflects the protracted
development of perceptual abilities, which underlies a multitude of immaturities in children’s processing of
auditory information particularly in difficult listening situations. This work takes an innovative and unprecedented
approach to study the impact of reverberation in auditory virtual reality, in which realistic auditory environments
mimicking children’s learning environments are simulated to maximize ecological validity.
Across the specific aims, we examine three aspects of functional spatial hearing abilities under virtual
reverberant environments that vary in interaural coherence—a metric that describes reverberation severity. In
Aim 1, we will investigate developmental changes in apparent source width—a measure of perceived auditory
object size that is critical for auditory scene analysis. In Aim 2, we will investigate the development of minimum
audible angle, the smallest detectable angular separation between two sounds—a well-tested metric for auditory
spatial acuity. In Aim 3, we will investigate developmental changes in minimum angular separation—a novel
measure of spatial unmasking based on the smallest spatial separation required to receive a target speech
benefit in competing babbles. By correlating the three outcome measures from the independent aims, we will
assess the inter-relationships between auditory object perception, spatial acuity, and spatial unmasking in
reverberant environments among school-aged children.
Findings from the proposed work will (i) establish our understanding of typical developmental trajectories of
functional spatial hearing in realistic reverberant environments, and (ii) elucidate the role of auditory object
perception in spatial acuity and subsequently spatial unmasking in children. Together, this work will provide
intervention benchmark to assess fitting outcomes for children with hearing loss, and will generate substantial
feasibility and pilot data for a planned R01 to develop fitting strategies for children with hearing devices."

to provide scientific leadership across the continuum from basic health services to implementation research. In
this way, we will play a vital role in helping VHA meet the challenges of providing timely, coordinated,
consistently high-quality care to more than 9 million Veterans each year.
 While proud of our track record, we recognize that new methods and models are required to meet the ever-
changing needs of VHA and our Veterans, who experience a disproportionately high burden of disease related
to poor health behaviors and other clinical and social factors, face challenges to accessing health care, and
have greater need of long-term care services and supports than at any time in history. Based on a 1-year
planning process involving extensive input from VHA leadership and other stakeholders, and drawing from the
World Health Organization’s conceptual framework of resilient, or adaptive, health care systems, we have
selected 3 focused areas of research for the next 5 years that align with VA strategic priorities: (1) promoting
and sustaining healthy behaviors; (2) enhancing access through virtual care; and (3) optimizing function
and independence. We have formed investigator teams to focus on each priority area in close collaboration
with health system partners. Each team will support a portfolio of externally funded projects, catalyze new
ideas through pilot studies and grant development workshops, provide intellectual leadership in the larger
research community, and be a national resource to inform VA clinical care and policy decisions. To continue
our longstanding commitment to training and career development, each research area will also attract and
support promising junior investigators and provide individual mentorship to foster their scientific development.
 Scientific rigor, an essential underpinning of the work to be done in each research focus area, will be
reinforced and advanced by the formation of 3 cross-cutting methods labs: 1) the Pragmatic Clinical Trials Lab
will facilitate application of methods to evaluate effectiveness of interventions in real-life routine practice
conditions; 2) the Non-Randomized Design Lab will support rigorous application of causal inference methods in
observational studies and integration of novel data sources; and 3) our successful Implementation Lab will be
expanded to incorporate Improvement Science. To ensure that research studies are designed to address VA’s
highest priorities and that research findings are relevant and actionable, we will strengthen existing

11103557,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Myocardial infarction (MI) can lead to heart failure (HF), which severely impacts the quality of life of millions of
Americans. MI triggers a cascade of cardiac growth and remodeling (G&R) patterns. They change ventricular
size, shape, and function, driven by biomechanical, neurohormonal, and genetic stimuli. Adaptive short-term
G&R can stabilize cardiac performance. Yet, in many patients, adverse long-term G&R is unstable and
progresses to HF. Unfortunately, those patients lack robust clinical predictors because the biomechanical
stimuli of adverse G&R patterns are still unclear. Computational models of full-heart biomechanics, informed by
cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), show high potential to fill this gap. The foundation of this project
is a novel microstructure-based model of cell-scale G&R based on the homogenized constrained mixture
theory, co-developed by the applicant, Dr. Pfaller. In addition, this research plan will leverage a multiscale
model that combines cell-scale G&R and organ-scale cardiac contraction and validation with CMR in swine
and humans to predict the propensity to develop HF with the mechanobiological stability theory. In Aim 1, Dr.
Pfaller will refine and validate a framework for subject-specific models of cardiac G&R. After calibrating the
model to pressure and kinematic CMR measurements in control swine, he will introduce MI to the multiscale
model and validate the prediction of G&R with matching measurements in post-MI swine. In Aim 2, Dr. Pfaller
will quantify the propensity of developing adverse G&R with the mechanobiological stability theory and identify
risk factors of post-MI HF from infarct properties. He will test the validity of his HF prediction with longitudinal
human CMR and clinical data from the UK Biobank. Dr. Pfaller has excellent prior training in cardiac
biomechanics, medical imaging, and computational engineering with an established publication record in
cardiac and cardiovascular biomechanics. His career development plan (K99-phase) will provide additional
training in cardiac biology and using CMR for human subjects. Dr. Pfaller will also receive a wealth of informal
and didactic training at Stanford University, which will be critical for Dr. Pfaller to gain autonomy and launch a
productive career as an independent engineering-scientist. Mentor Dr. Marsden is a leading expert in patient-
specific modeling of the cardiovascular system. Co-Mentor Dr. Ennis (CMR) and advisors Drs. Humphrey (cell-
scale modeling), Cyron (stability theory), Kuhl (organ-scale modeling), Yang (cardiac biology), Salerno (heart
failure) offer complementary expertise. Dr. Pfaller will receive the necessary guidance and resources to
accomplish these goals and efficiently transition to independence (R00-phase). In summary, the strong
mentoring environment and training plan will fully prepare Dr. Pfaller to launch his independent career. The
proposed studies promise to offer insights into biomechanical stimuli of adverse G&R and help optimize
diagnostics and therapies that predict and ultimately prevent HF after MI."

In this Pathway to Independence Award application, Dr. Christine (Ruochao) Zhang outlines detailed career
developmental plans to strategically enhance her knowledge in trending hematology and her expertise of state-
of-the-art techniques while interrogating how Dnmt3a mutations endow hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) a fitness
advantage during chronic inflammation and prime defective hematopoiesis for disease progression.
Dr. Zhang is a postdoctoral research associate at the Washington University School of Medicine and has a strong
background in epigenetics and genetics with a diverse range of technical skills. Herein, she wants to understand
how epigenetic perturbations lead to defective hematopoiesis and consequently blood diseases. The primary
goal of Dr. Zhang is to become an independent investigator in epigenetic hematology. Dr. Zhang has proposed
career development plans, where she will be rigorously trained with highly successful, world-renowned leaders
in hematology, including hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) biology (Dr. Grant Challen), bone
marrow niche and pathology (Dr. Daniel Link), and disease hematopoiesis (Dr. Timothy Ley). Her outstanding
mentor team will ensure her success in reaching this ambitious goal. Dr. Zhang will gain 1) strengthened
knowledge in HSPC biology, bone marrow composition, and hematologic disease pathology; 2) expertise in
advanced epigenetic analysis at the single-cell level and in multiplex imaging analysis; 3) critical soft skills
required for running a successful and innovative independent laboratory.
Somatic mutations in DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) acquired in the HSC compartment during aging give
rise to clonal hematopoiesis (CH), a condition associated with increased risks of hematologic diseases. The
disproportional prevalence between DNMT3A-CH (10%) and blood diseases (~1%) suggests environmental
pressures are likely required for clonal selection and evolution for disease progression. While cumulative
evidence has suggested that DNMT3A mutations can be selected by chronic interferon-gamma (IFNg) signaling,
it remains elusive how DNMT3A mutations confer a fitness advantage to HSCs during chronic inflammation; how
the expansion of Dnmt3a-mutant HSCs reshapes the bone marrow composition and ultimately leading to disease
conditions. The goal of this study is to interrogate the mechanism(s) underlying the HSC fitness advantage
conveyed by Dnmt3a mutations and to understand how the defective hematopoiesis selected by chronic
inflammation gives rise to disease conditions at least in part attributed to bone marrow remodeling.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop Dr. Zhang into a successful independent investigator in
epigenetic hematology. The knowledge and experience acquired from the proposed studies and the career
development plan will firmly set her on the path to becoming a leading investigator of epigenetic hematology."
11098959,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented shock to the U.S. health care system and to care
delivery for patients. As documented by the study team, the COVID-19 pandemic suddenly and dramatically
changed health care utilization patterns, including a rapid escalation in use of telehealth services, an abrupt
decline in in-person services, and a large volume of deferred services. It is unclear how these care patterns will
evolve over the course of the pandemic (e.g., the degree to which deferred services will occur later, telehealth
will substitute for in-person services, and new levels of telehealth services will be sustained), much less in the
years following the COVID-19 pandemic, and how continuing care patterns will differ for socially and clinically
vulnerable patient populations. Physician organizations (POs) face differing burdens in rapidly adopting
telemedicine, and PO barriers to telemedicine adoption may be reflected in the outcomes of patients treated by
these POs. The reduction in in-person care has placed financial stress on many POs, leading to concerns that
many POs may go out of business or consolidate. The impacts of care reductions, the adoption of telemedicine
as a new care delivery modality, and access to POs are likely to have larger effects among vulnerable patient
populations, including lower-income, rural, and racial/ethnic minority populations, and patients with multiple
chronic conditions. Understanding patient and provider responses to the COVID-19 public health crisis and the
care patients receive, particularly those who are medically and socially vulnerable, is essential to inform
immediate-term and longer-term policymaking intended to help the health delivery system respond to COVID-
19. We propose to conduct a set of analyses to 1) Estimate how health services have changed during the
COVID-19 pandemic, the factors associated with changes in health service use, if health delayed care remains
unmet once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, how policy responses (social distancing policies and COVID-
19 vaccination) have impacted care delivery, and how these patterns differ for medically and socially
vulnerable patient populations; 2) Asses PO barriers to adopting telemedicine and assess if PO adoption of
telemedicine lessens adverse health outcomes, particularly among vulnerable patient populations; and 3)
Examine if PO closure or consolidation due to COVID-19 leads to gaps in patient care continuity or access
barriers among vulnerable patient populations. To do so, we will leverage the existing data assets and
expertise of the RAND U19 Center of Excellence that the research team has built over the past 5 years. We
will use 100% Medicare fee-for-service claims data. Findings from this study will help inform an array of
immediate-term and longer-term policies and regulatory changes, including changes to payment policies, use
of technology, financial assistance to providers to ensure their survival, and improving the ability of health
systems to respond to how the COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the US health care system."
11110864,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Smell is a fundamental human sense. Even though humans do not rely on smell for survival, olfaction is
necessary for physical and behavioral health. Detection and identification of volatile chemicals by the olfactory
system is built upon the “one receptor per neuron” rule, whereby each mature olfactory sensory neuron
expresses a single olfactory receptor (OR) gene from one allele. Singular expression is critical for olfactory
perception, since it defines both the receptive field of the OSN and the circuitry of its axon.
 OR gene choice and singular expression is contingent on orchestrated changes in nuclear architecture.
Using live-cell imaging, I will elucidate how this changing nuclear architecture leads to changes in gene
expression. In Aim 1, I will image the endogenous transcription factors (Lhx2/Ebf/Ldb1) and the actively
expressed OR DNA to determine how these transcription factors promote the expression of a single OR allele.
My preliminary results suggest that these transcription factors come together to form an activating hub, and that
this hub represents a greater enrichment of transcription factors than can be explained simply by the
stoichiometry of enhancer binding sites. I will image the relationship between the actively expressed OR and
heterochromatin markers to determine if association with the activating hub isolates this allele from
heterochromatin. In Aim 2, I will investigate the nature of the biomolecular interactions that allow this activating
hub to recruit Lhx2/Ebf/Ldb1 beyond the stoichiometry of binding sites through single-particle tracking of
transcription factor mutants. I will determine if the amplification in recruitment is due to phase separation of the
intrinsically-disordered domains of Lhx2/Ebf/Ldb1 or if it is due to cooperative protein-protein interactions. Finally,
in Aim 3, the independent phase of this proposal, I will integrate the imaging of these transcription factors with
imaging of the genome to extend my research towards a complete characterization of the nucleoprotein
dynamics regulating OR gene expression. Specifically, I will begin by characterizing the interactions of OR
enhancers and OR mRNA with Lhx2/Ebf/Ldb1 and the actively expressed OR using live-cell imaging.
 I am determined to lead an independent research laboratory at an academic institution, working at the
interface of OR gene regulation and optical microscopy. I am optimally positioned to achieve this goal, working
as I am with Dr. Stavros Lomvardas at Columbia University. Dr. Lomvardas is an expert in olfaction and genome
organization, and during the K99, I will receive technical training from him in advanced sequencing technologies.
I have also assembled an advisory team consisting of Drs. Elizabeth Hillman, Richard Axel, Carol A. Mason, and
Anum Glasgow. This advisory team will guide me in professional training and transitioning to independence. In
addition to elucidating general principles of how nuclear organization can dictate transcriptional specificity, the
experiments in this proposal will enable a mechanistic interrogation of the molecular interactions that regulate
singular OR transcription."

11116147,"Project Summary/Abstract
Vascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Some common vascular diseases include: cardio
vascular disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). Many of these vascular diseases need point-of-
care (POC) diagnosis and monitoring using non-ionizing, non-invasive and cost-effective approaches. Although
Doppler ultrasound meets all these requirements, it only maps blood flow, which is operator dependent and
influenced by motion artifacts, resulting in limited sensitivity and specificity to detect the disease in its early stage.
A POC technique that provides direct label-free molecular and functional information of vasculature is needed to
reliably detect and monitor vascular diseases.
 A mobile photoacoustic imager (mPAI) is proposed for diagnosing various vascular diseases in resource poor
settings of the world. Leveraging on strong multispectral optical absorption of oxy- and de-oxy hemoglobins, the
mPAI is capable of providing multi-parametric information of deep vasculature, such as blood oxygen saturation,
plaque lipids, blood flow and blood clot. The mPAI is non-invasive, real time and uses non-ionizing optical and
ultrasound radiation. This will be the first and perhaps the only portable technology capable of deriving such
multiparametric functional information of deep vasculature without the use of contrast agents. Competing
technologies cannot provide such a direct information of vascular health, and certainly not in a compact portable
device form. Health care providers can use the mPAI to instantly diagnose several vascular diseases affecting
humans of all ages, including infants.
 In the R21 phase, Aim1 will design and develop the mPAI, integrating the low-cost optical illumination and
piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducer (PMUT) arrays. Dr. Rundra Pratap team from the Indian
Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, will design and fabricate the PMUT arrays. Dr. Kothapalli team will develop
the mPAI and validate its performance on tissue mimicking vascular phantoms in Aim 1, and rat models of PAD
in Aim 2. The ultimate goal of the two-year R21 phase is to achieve a clinical grade mPAI device with reliable
vascular imaging metrics.
 In the R33 phase, to test the clinical performance of the mPAI, the following multicenter pilot clinical studies
on PAD patients will be conducted in 1) Penn State Hershey medical center, 2) Vikram Hospital in India through
collaborations with the IISc team, and 3) in Ghana in Year 5 with the help of Dr. Colette Pameijer of Penn State
who conducts medical camps in Ghana every year through Penn State Global Health Program. Clinical studies
in R33 phase will be undertaken only if well-defined milestones are achieved in the R21 phase.
 The overall goal of these studies is to carefully validate the clinical potential of emerging label-free
photoacoustic imaging technology to screen for vascular diseases, in a portable form, in resource poor settings
of the world."
11116027,"PROJECT 1 | SUMMARY
Mechanisms underlying the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)—a normal developmental process and
an early event at the onset of epithelium-derived cancers—are minimally understood. Our findings, corroborated
by others in multiple biologically relevant models, have established mitotic gene bookmarking—occupancy of
target genes by transcription factors during mitosis—as a novel dimension to epigenetic control of lineage
commitment and cell identity. Because EMT results from loss of the epithelial phenotype, Project 1 will address
whether disruption of mitotic gene bookmarking constitutes a key mechanistic component of EMT.
Recently, we have shown that depletion of the RUNX1 transcription factor in normal mammary epithelial (NME)
cells results in EMT in both in vivo and cell-based models, indicating that RUNX1 stabilizes the normal ME
phenotype. Our preliminary data show that in ME cells undergoing mitosis, RUNX1 bookmarks genes involved
in cell proliferation, growth and maintenance of the epithelial phenotype. These findings provide the rationale for
our hypothesis that mitotic bookmarking of target genes by RUNX1 is a key epigenetic mechanism for
maintenance of the normal mammary epithelial phenotype, and perturbation of this mechanism leads to EMT.
Innovative molecular and cellular experimental strategies will be combined with state-of-the-art genomics
approaches to investigate how the RUNX1 mitotic epigenome contributes to initiation of EMT, an early event that
leads to development of breast cancer. Aim 1 will use candidate and unbiased CRISPR screens to determine
how RUNX1 bookmarked genes are physiologically linked to the mammary epithelial phenotype and whether
estrogen receptor signaling—a key determinant of NME phenotype—plays a role in regulation of RUNX1-
bookmarked genes. Aim 2 will employ Hi-ChIP and HIPMap to establish whether RUNX1 bookmarked genes
reside in same genomic neighborhoods for coordinate control. We will assess whether disruption of these
genomic regions confers EMT. Aim 3 will take advantage of degron-based RUNX1 depletion to investigate the
regulatory impact of RUNX1 mitotic bookmarking on target gene expression and maintenance of the NME
phenotype.
Project 1 studies will address significant gaps in current knowledge of the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate
EMT. Our findings will establish RUNX1 mitotic bookmarking as a unique dimension to epigenetic control of the
normal mammary epithelial phenotype, which when disrupted, results in EMT, a key early event in the
development and progression of breast cancer."

11105365,"MicroRNA Regulation of NMNAT-Mediated Neuroprotection Against Peripheral Neuropathy and
 Chronic Pain
 PROJECT SUMMARY
 Peripheral neuropathy and neuropathy pain can be caused by a myriad of genetic and environment
factors as well as therapeutic or recreational drug use. In particular, chemotherapy-induced peripheral
neuropathy (CIPN) is the major dose-limiting neurotoxic side effect of standard chemotherapy regiments. Over
68% of cancer patients experience neuropathic symptoms after chemotherapy, and that contributes to a
significant percent of the population that suffer from chronic pain and have to resort to opioid use. Currently
there are no effective treatments available, largely due to a lack of understanding of the in vivo mechanisms of
CIPN and related peripheral neuropathy. Recently, we have optimized a model of peripheral neuropathy using
Drosophila larvae that recapitulates salient behavior and neuronal morphological aspects of chemotherapy-
induced sensory dysfunction. Our preliminary work using this model has uncovered a new mechanism
underlying peripheral neuropathy, and identified a neuroprotective protein NMNAT with promising potential for
mitigating neuropathic pain. The ultimate goal of our research is to uncover the endogenous mechanisms
underlying peripheral neuropathy and to identify neuroprotective mechanisms and potential targets that
facilitate the development of new therapeutic agents against CIPN and related neuropathic pain.
 Our previous work on neuronal maintenance and protection has identified NMNAT (nicotinamide
mononucleotide adenylyl transferase), the last enzyme in NAD+ synthesis pathway, as an essential gene that
maintains neuronal structural and functional integrity. Extensive mechanistic studies from our lab and others
have found NMNAT proteins in Drosophila and mammals to be among the most robust and versatile
neuroprotective factors, and a positive correlation between NMNAT expression levels and the neuronal self-
protective capacity. Excitingly, from a compound screen, several natural compounds were identified to
upregulate NMNAT transcription, and we have collected intriguing preliminary results suggesting that the
expression of NMNAT is regulated by microRNAs. We hypothesize that regulation of NMNAT RNA expression
by natural compounds and microRNAs at the steps of transcription, pre-mRNA splicing, and mRNA stability
allows rapid and dynamic shifting between NMNAT mediated NAD+ metabolism and neuronal resilience, and
confers protection in sensory neurons against peripheral neuropathy. In this application we outline
experiments to (1) identify microRNAs that regulate nociceptive hypersensitivity, (2) identify and characterize
the molecular pharmacology of natural compounds in regulating NMNAT expression, and (3) modulate NMNAT
transcriptional regulation to enhance neuroprotection against peripheral neuropathy. Within the network of
convergent pathways responding to chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy, understanding the
regulation of NMNAT in both NAD+-metabolism and enhancing neuronal homeostasis will facilitate discovery of
neuroprotective strategies in peripheral neuropathy and neuropathic pain."

11103368,"The dual site Center of Innovation (COIN) for Veteran-Centered and Value-Driven Care is located at the
VA Puget Sound and Eastern Colorado Health Care Systems. Research products from our Center's 47
investigators have impacted VA policy and care delivery across a spectrum of primary, specialty and mental
healthcare services. We accomplished these impacts through partnerships with operational leaders and
application of the National Academy of Medicine's Learning Health System (LHS). We employ the LHS through
our research, implementation science, evaluation and training programs. Collectively, we help the VA become
an efficient healthcare system where best practices and new knowledge are translated into clinical care.
 Our mission is to conduct high-quality health services research that promotes Veteran-centered and value-
 driven care, generate and disseminate knowledge that contributes to the well-being of Veterans, work
collaboratively with VA policy and operational leaders to implement research finding into clinical care, and train
 the next generation of health services research leaders.
In the next 5 years, we will continue to align our programs with challenges faced by patients, providers, and the
VA health system. We have 2 research focus areas with 3 objectives embedded within each:
1. Promote Veteran-centered care and improve the patient experience across VA healthcare and
 community settings. We will accomplish the following: 1) develop methods to incorporate patient reported
 outcomes into routine clinical care and test interventions to improve these outcomes, 2) improve patient
 adherence and self-management through interventions targeting patients, providers and health systems, 3)
innovate the delivery of specialty, mental, and/or primary health care services to patients using patient-
centered approaches that bridge socioeconomic and geographic disparities.
2. Advance value-driven care by providing Veterans the highest quality care at lowest financial burden. We
 will develop new approaches to care that: 1) help the VA efficiently utilize, integrate, and coordinate health
 services received within the VA and in the community, 2) improve the quality and safety of care through
 appropriate implementation and de-implementation of healthcare services and 3) identify methods to
 improve workforce development, deployment, and provider satisfaction and well-being.
Our emerging research areas include women's health, suicide prevention, and eliminating disparities. We have
led and will continue to lead Veteran engagement efforts in research for VA nationally.
Over the past 3 years, we obtained funding for 113 projects, generated $47 million in operating revenue and
published 583 manuscripts. We trained 35 post-doctoral fellows and 12 VA and non-VA career development
awardees. Our investigators were awarded the HSR&D best paper awards in 2015 and 2016. Our work has
been recognized by national media, presented to Congress, resulted in legislation, designated as VA promising
practices for broad dissemination, and informed both VA-wide health services improvements and CMS policy.
Drs. David Au (in Seattle) and P. Michael Ho (in Denver) will continue as co-Directors along with Associate
Directors, Drs. Steven Zeliadt (Seattle) and Cari Levy (Denver). Collectively, they have worked together for
more than 10 years, are outstanding researchers and have experience leading complex organizations.
Our Center excels in engaging operational partners including the Offices of Patient-Centered Care and Cultural
Transformation; Rural Health; Primary Care; Specialty Care; and Veterans Access to Care. Research products
strategically address VA operational and VA Secretary priorities. We work closely with the Universities of
Washington and Colorado, where all our investigators serve as faculty. Further, we have strong ties with our
respective medical centers, VISNs, and partners outside VA including NIH, CDC, and Kaiser Permanente."

11103963,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-
CA-24-032. This administrative supplement application pertains to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) P30
Cancer Center Support Grant that supports the Markey Cancer Center (MCC), a university-based matrix cancer
center at the University of Kentucky (UK). The mission of MCC is to reduce cancer burden through research,
prevention, treatment, education and community engagement, with a focus on Kentucky and its most vulnerable
populations. As the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in the state, MCC is vital to Kentucky,
the state which leads the nation in all-site cancer incidence and mortality. MCC aims to translate scientific
discoveries into innovative and personalized diagnostic and treatment advances that improve the lives of cancer
survivors. Consistent with MCC’s goal to provide exceptional patient-centered, outcome-driven cancer care that
exceeds expectations of cancer survivors and caregivers alike, MCC employs advanced practice providers who
deliver survivorship care. NOT-CA-24-032 provides a perfect opportunity to examine the quality of MCC
survivorship care and take initial steps toward improvement and expansion. The specific aims of the
administrative supplement are: 1) Describe the degree to which MCC survivorship care meets the National
Standards for Survivorship Care; 2) Identify MCC cancer survivor and caregiver-reported barriers and facilitators
to accessing MCC survivorship care and explore differences based on survivors’ treatment phase, disease stage,
and geographic residence; and 3) Ascertain promising implementation strategies to improve the quality, reach,
adoption, and effectiveness of MCC survivorship care. To accomplish these specific aims, a concurrent mixed-
methods study that is guided by the Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model and includes
multiple stakeholders (specifically, MCC providers, administrators, advisory group members, survivors and
caregivers) as participants will be conducted during the 1-year award period. With unique research strengths
and a firm commitment to quality cancer care, MCC is well-poised to generate robust data that will improve the
survivorship care it provides."

BOLD AND NEW BIOENGINEERING RESEARCH”
In contrast with other organs, preservation times of lung grafts for transplantation are limited to
no more than 8 hours with standard cold preservation. Declining quality with extending
preservation times increases the risk of primary graft dysfunction, a risk factor for developing
chronic rejection, which could account for the low 5-year survival rate (50%) following lung
transplantation (LTx). Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP) is expected to improve lung preservation
and transplant outcomes by providing normothermic circulation and ventilation. A problem is that
current EVLP is self-limited by normothermia-activated lung metabolism. The accumulation of
toxic metabolites leads to a proinflammatory state, activating Receptor of Advanced Glycation
End-Products (RAGE) and nuclear factor (NF)-B mechanisms, which in turn upregulate
proinflammatory cytokine signaling. Experimentally, cross-circulation of a whole swine with EVLP
by others demonstrated improved lung resuscitation, but the exact contributors to this
improvement remain unclear. Own in vitro preliminary data suggest a role for hepatic function in
enhancing endothelial preservation. In previous work, we have maintained normal hepatic
detoxification, synthesis, and regulation in in vitro circuits using liver cell bioreactors (BRx). We
hypothesize first that the liver function in the swine cross-circulation model played a major role
in enhancing EVLP and tissue viability. We also hypothesize that a hepatocyte BRx can partly
substitute for whole-swine liver function on EVLP and maintain the observed improvements lung
preservation and LTx outcomes. Our Specific Aim is to provide proof-of-principle for the ability
of hepatocyte BRx to enhance lung graft preservation. We will incorporate a hepatic BRx in our
established EVLP circuits and demonstrate its effect on short-term LTx in experimental rat
models. We will repeat these experiments using a cadaveric human EVLP model. We will conduct
comprehensive phenotypic, transcriptional, and functional endpoint assessments on lung tissue
and hepatic cells in BRx, such as RAGE and NF-B. If successful, our technology will provide the
means to change the current state of EVLP for lung preservation and allow lungs to be maintained
longer outside the donor body with less cellular injury. Ultimately, our work will address current
limitations in LTx, including increasing viable donor organ transportation time and distance,
helping reduce LTx waiting lists, and improving post-transplant patient survival."
11104097,"Abstract/Project Summary: This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest
(NOSI) identified as ""NOT-CA-24-041.” Dartmouth Cancer Center (DCC) is one of the only NCI-designated
Comprehensive Cancer Center serving a primarily rural catchment area, with 81% of patients living in rural
areas. The catchment population has a higher cancer incidence relative to the U.S—leading to a relatively
large population of cancer survivors served by DCC. With the 2024 release of the National Standards for
Cancer Survivorship Care, cancer centers—including DCC—now have a framework by which to assess and
implement survivorship programming to improve outcomes in care, including engagement of survivors in
follow-up care. Several studies show that engagement in survivorship care is associated with better overall
well-being and cancer-related outcomes. Yet, survivorship care must tackle a diverse set of clinical and non-
clinical needs, including risk of cancer recurrence, increased risk of developing other cancers, late treatment
effects, impacts to mental health, and reduced quality of life and functional capacity. Receipt of survivorship
care is inversely associated with distance to care, an issue further compounded by transportation and financial
challenges common among rural survivors. Though care has traditionally been provided in-person, the new
national standards acknowledge the importance of telehealth and digital delivery of care, which may be
especially important in rural areas with longer travel times to in-person services. In this proposed study, we will
assess the alignment of DCC’s survivorship program with the 2024 standards, identify gaps, and examine
opportunities for expanding engagement of survivors through promising digital health interventions. Using a
quality improvement framework, we will conduct an environmental scan of DCC’s survivorship program to
identify gaps and opportunities by inventorying program components, the extent to which components have
been fully implemented, and use by survivors. In assessing utilization, we will summarize and compare
demographic (e.g., age, gender, rurality) and clinical (e.g., cancer stage/type, time since treatment)
characteristics between survivors engaging in survivorship care with those not engaging. We will also conduct
surveys (n=200) and qualitative interviews (n=25) with cancer survivors to elucidate perceived barriers and
facilitators to receiving survivorship care, unmet needs, input on how DCC’s survivorship program could best
meet survivor needs, and perspectives on digital health tools to incorporate into DCC’s survivorship program.
To ensure sustainability and translation of the findings, we will convene a broad group of cancer survivorship
stakeholders to review and interpret the study findings. Through consensus building sessions stakeholder
groups will develop recommendations for enhancements to DCC’s survivorship program, including
implementation of digital tools to expand access to services, particularly for DCC’s rural survivor population."

 Laryngotracheal Stenosis (LTS) is the pathologic narrowing of the larynx, subglottis, and trachea
secondary to injury from prolonged intubation. This leads to dyspnea, dysphonia, and can rapidly progress to
airway compromise. Management of LTS is primarily surgical as medical therapies for LTS are limited due to
poor understanding of LTS pathogenesis. Improved understanding of the mechanisms promoting LTS are
needed to improve treatment. Previous investigation has revealed that an intact immune response is critical to
the development of LTS. Characterization of the immune response in LTS has demonstrated increased
populations of CD4+ T-cells and macrophages. Preliminary studies in a murine LTS model reveal that
depletion of the macrophage population attenuates LTS fibrosis, implicating their pathologic role. However, the
local immune mediators and cell signaling pathways promoting pathologic macrophages in LTS are unknown.
 Macrophage activation is regulated through stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are highly
conserved receptors recognizing Pathogen or Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs/DAMPs) and
lead to downstream activation of regulatory proteins controlling phenotype. Using single cell RNA sequencing
the PI has demonstrated increased expression of the TLR4-MyD88 signaling pathway in LTS macrophages.
Furthermore, we have identified increased expression of the DAMP S100A8/A9 in LTS tissue. S100A8/A9 is a
known activator of TLR4-MyD88 signaling, and worsens fibrosis in our murine LTS model. These findings
indicate that TLR4-MyD88 signaling pathways in macrophages may be critical to LTS pathogenesis. However,
the relationship between S100A8/A9, TLR4-MyD88 signaling, and pathologic macrophages has not been
explored in LTS or other fibrotic diseases, and may represent a critical signaling axis driving pathologic fibrosis.
 For this study, we will elucidate the signaling networks promoting pathologic macrophages in LTS. In Aim 1
we will assess S100A8/A9 on macrophage phenotype in a murine LTS model, establish that S100A8/A9s
profibrotic effect is mediated by macrophages, and identify key sources of pathologic S100A8/A9. In Aim 2, we
will demonstrate the critical role of TLR4-MyD88 signaling in promoting pathologic macrophages in LTS. Finally,
in Aim 3 we will assess S100A8/A9 as a candidate biomarker for the development of LTS in patients who have
had prolonged intubation. Collectively, this application will lead to an in-depth understanding of the cell signaling
networks promoting dysregulated macrophage mediated inflammation and subsequent fibrosis in LTS."

The Stanford Cancer Institute’s (SCI) mission is to leverage the broad and unique strengths of Stanford
University in basic science, bioengineering, population science, biostatistics, technology development, clinical
research, clinical care, and translation to (1) improve the diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of cancer patients;
(2) understand cancer etiologies among diverse populations; and (3) decrease cancer incidence in the SCI
catchment area and beyond. SCI is committed to improving long-term outcomes by ensuring that cancer
survivors have access to guideline concordant survivorship care, including timely referrals to supportive services
and preventative care. This proposal is designed to evaluate the alignment of survivorship care delivery within
clinical care programs at the Comprehensive Cancer Center in Palo Alto and network sites, with the National
Standards for Cancer Survivorship Care.
In partnership with operational leaders and project managers at Stanford Healthcare, we will use a mixed
methods approach to leverage data that exist in the electronic medical record, cancer center registry, institutional
policies, and implementation projects; and supplement this by adding surveys and in-depth interviews with key
informants and stakeholders. Integrated data analysis will inform a comprehensive report of the effectiveness
and reach of Stanford’s Cancer Survivorship Program, alignment with the National Standards for Cancer
Survivorship Care, and gaps and barriers to care delivery. Key findings will provide data to support the allocation
of resources, customization of workflows and training of staff and healthcare professionals. Activities proposed
in this research are highly aligned with the SCI’s commitment to understand and address gaps in survivorship
care and will lead to research initiatives designed to test new models of care and interventions to improve
physical, emotional, and mental health. Ultimately, this work aims to harmonize best practices across the
Stanford network in line with national survivorship care standards, improve the quality of survivorship care, and
thus enhance the long-term outcomes and well-being of all cancer survivors."
11105305,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The complexity of childhood cancer survivorship care delivery necessitates systematic
optimization, especially as the U.S. survivor population approaches 580,000. The St. Jude
Comprehensive Cancer Center's Cancer Control and Survivorship Program aims to enhance care
through multidisciplinary approaches, yet significant barriers persist, particularly in non-
specialized clinics. Existing guidelines require detailed cancer histories and treatment risk factors,
challenging to obtain in community settings where providers often manage few, diverse survivors.
Currently, most survivorship follow-up care is provided by primary care providers who often lack
the necessary expertise and resources. Different models of survivorship care have been
developed to aid in this process, such as community-based shared-care and comprehensive
survivor programs. However, these continue to face unique challenges and have not proven
universally effective. Qualitative interviews about survivorship care have begun to identify
important barriers and highlight healthcare systems challenges survivors and providers face when
attempting to deliver effective care to survivors. This study seeks to address gaps in survivorship
care delivery by employing system dynamics and group model building to explore barriers and
interconnections within the care process. The proposal will generate a qualitative model of
survivorship care developed in collaboration with patients, families, and clinicians involved in their
care. This involves two primary aims. We will conduct sequential group model building workshops
with clinical teams (Aim 1) as well as survivors and their families (Aim 2). This work will result in
the development of causal loop diagrams to describe the complex system of care and will be used
to identify leverage points. Participants include primary care providers, subspecialists, oncology
teams, and survivors/families. This research is significant for its potential to elucidate the
complexities of survivorship care, enhancing accessibility and equity beyond highly resourced
settings. The innovative participatory modeling approach will generate qualitative models
considering multimorbidity, health-related quality of life, psychosocial adversity, geographic
constraints, and genetic predisposition. This comprehensive model will guide the design,
dissemination, and implementation of effective survivorship care solutions, ensuring sustainable
and high-quality care delivery for childhood cancer survivors across diverse settings. The insights
gained will contribute to better health outcomes and quality of life for the growing population of
pediatric cancer survivors."
11105307,"Malnutrition contributes to half of all global child deaths. Severe malnutrition interferes with the liver's synthesis
of albumin, complement and coagulation factors, and bile acids (BAs). BA deficiency impairs nutrient absorption
and growth and alters signaling through nuclear receptors including farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) to impact a wide
range of processes. Using a mouse model of early postnatal malnutrition, we reported that decreased BA
synthesis in malnutrition causes decreased FXR activation and decreased expression of FXR target genes
including coagulation factors. The resulting malnutrition-induced coagulopathy can cause child mortality. It is
not known why BA synthesis is impaired in malnutrition. Our published data and new preliminary data
indicate malnutrition impairs the activity (not expression) of the rate-determining enzyme (CYP7A1) in the classic
pathway of BA synthesis due to depletion of the essential cofactor heme. We present novel evidence that
restoring heme increases BA synthesis. We now seek to understand why heme synthesis is impaired in
malnutrition. Heme is generated from tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle products and enzymes that require ironsulfur
(Fe-S) clusters for stability. Fe-S clusters are derived from both Fe and S-containing amino acids
(AAs), which are found in dietary protein or generated by transsulfuration. Like most low-protein diets, our mouse
malnourishing diet is deficient in S-containing AAs. The mice exhibit decreased expression of transsulfuration
and Fe-S cluster-dependent TCA cycle enzymes, suggesting that deficiency of S-containing AAs and Fe-S
clusters drives liver dysfunction in malnutrition. Indeed, we decreased BA synthesis by 50% by maintaining
hepatocytes in low-AA media, and we restored BA production by adding S-containing AAs (but not other AAs).
Thus, we hypothesize that deficiency of S-containing AAs in malnutrition impairs BA synthesis by disrupting
TCA cycle function, heme biosynthesis, and CYP7 A 1 activity. Our Specific Aims are to 1) Characterize in AAdeficient
hepatocytes TCA cycle dysfunction by quantifying flux of labeled glucose through the TCA cycle and
measuring expression levels and activity of Fe-S cluster-dependent TCA cycle enzymes before and after heme
treatment; 2) Define the role of S-containing AAs and heme in BA synthesis by measuring BA synthesis by
hepatocytes maintained in low-AA media and treated in a high-throughput manner with combinations of AAs and
heme and using adeno-associated virus or siRNA to manipulate levels of transsulfuration and Fe-S clusterdependent
enzymes; and 3) Determine whether a novel nutritional therapeutic can rescue BA synthesis in
malnutrition by feeding mice the malnourishing diet supplemented by S-containing AAs, then quantifying TCA
cycle function, heme synthesis, and BA production in primary hepatocytes. Expected outcomes include
elucidation of a novel link between malnutrition, TCA cycle and heme homeostasis, and BA synthesis.
The research is significant because of its potential to develop a scalable AA-based therapeutic to restore liver
synthetic function and treat malnutrition in children.

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as ""NOT-CA-
24-041"". In this administrative supplement to the parent grant, we apply the National Standards for
Survivorship Care, recently published during the spring of 2024, to evaluate the quality and utilization of the
Buffet Cancer Center (BCC) Survivorship Program. Our evaluation will focus on organizational policies
and processes for delivering survivorship care across our catchment area. This project extends the
parent Cancer Center Support Grant for BCC, which promotes innovative translational cancer research,
excellence in cancer education and training, and outstanding patient-centered cancer care, aiming to reduce
the burden of cancer and cancer health disparities across Nebraska and beyond. Effective survivorship care
requires a patient-centered approach and coordination across medical specialties to ensure quality care.
Findings from this project will inform organizational policies related to survivorship care delivery and broader
cancer care policies, especially those addressing patients' physical and social health needs. The proposed
project will examine the extent to which existing survivorship programs align with the National Standards of
Cancer Survivorship Care and the factors influencing their accessibility and utilization that remain
understudied. Our central hypothesis is that utilization and accessibility of survivorship will vary by cancer type
and patient sociodemographic factors. Understanding these aspects is essential for advancing survivorship
care and promoting the long-term well-being of cancer survivors. The proposed project aims to fill this gap by
evaluating the BCC Survivorship Program using the National Standards for Cancer Survivorship Care1 as a
guiding framework.
Aim 1: Evaluate accessibility and utilization of the survivorship program via electronic health records.
This includes assessing the number of internally referred patients, self-referred patients, visit frequency, and
the number lost to follow-up.
Aim 2: Assess the alignment of the BCC Survivorship Program with the National Standards and referral
pathways for survivorship care. This includes examining the organizational and systemic factors influencing
the delivery of survivorship care, such as institutional policies, resources, and interprofessional collaboration,
using the National Standards for Survivorship Care as a guiding framework.
Aim 3: Identify barriers and facilitators to accessing survivorship care via patient and provider
interviews.
This study will provide critical insights into the effectiveness of the BCC Survivorship Program and offer
practical guidance for aligning survivorship care with national standards to improve outcomes for cancer
survivors."

the Center for Healthcare Organization and Implementation Research – now has the scientists, the
environment, and the resources to respond and contribute to the challenges that Veterans' healthcare will
face in the years to come. CHOIR's MISSION is to conduct organizationally-partnered, and Veteran-
partnered research in order to develop, implement, and evaluate evidence-based and innovative practices
that improve VA healthcare. Our VISION is that CHOIR serve as a large, vibrant, multi-campus Center
which engages the healthcare- and university-rich environment of Greater Boston to enhance VA services
and contribute to health services research (HSR) nationally and internationally. Our PRIORITY GOALS
are: (1) to advance the field of HSR by sustaining, developing, and growing our existing, scientific focus
areas, and growing our evolving and emerging scientific areas; (2) to enrich VA's cadre of world-class HSR
investigators, by supporting training and education across the career spectrum; (3) to grow and support
innovation, to maintain VA at the cutting edge of HSR and adapt to meet VA's ever-changing needs.
 CHOIR's three main Scientific Focus Areas have developed from collaborations with key VA partners.
Enhancing Recovery-Oriented Care for Vulnerable Populations [Major Partners: Office of Mental
Health and Suicide Prevention, Center for Homelessness Among Veterans] seeks to understand and
implement models of care to develop Veterans' independence, particularly in those with behavioral
vulnerabilities such as mental health challenges, homelessness and involvement with the justice system.
Medication Management & Outcomes [Major Partner: Pharmacy Benefits Management] addresses best
practices for pharmaceutical use, including studies of the quality, safety, and value of prescribing and
studies to engage Veterans in medication decision-making and improve adherence. Healthcare
Communications [Major Partners: Office of Connected Care, Office of Patient-Centered Care & Cultural
Transformation] conducts research on communicating adverse events to patients, on communicating with
patients using connected care technologies, and on patient-centered communication and care
coordination. In addition to these, CHOIR's Evolving Scientific Areas, first germinated as new emerging
areas 5 years ago, are now mature: Long-Term Care is partnered with the VA Office of Geriatrics and
Extended Care and studies Community Living Centers, models of Geriatric primary care, and team-based
care for the elderly, and Patient Safety, partnered with the VA National Center for Patient Safety, improves
measurement of patient safety by facilitating standardization and integration across existing patient safety
measures, developing and testing new measures to improve on traditional approaches.
 CHOIR research has had major impacts on research and on VA systems of care. Just two out of many
examples are Dr. Elwy's work, which has changed how VA surgeons are taught to talk to their patients
about surgical adverse events; and Dr. Bokhour's development of metrics to assess the impact of the VA
Whole Health Initiative on patient reported outcomes.
 CHOIR's future success will be built upon a strong commitment to successful mentoring and career
development throughout the career trajectory from post-doctoral to senior investigator levels. Our
successful post-doctoral programs, our career development award (CDA) support program, and our post-
CDA transition mentoring are all integral to CHOIR's mission and are essential elements of the Center
moving forward. Important new Emerging Areas are the Veteran Engagement in Research initiative,
bringing Veterans into the research process as stakeholders, and the CHOIR Innovation Incubator, in
which we both study the process of diffusing innovation within VA and support innovative HSR&D projects."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as ""NOT-CA-
24-041.” A growing population of survivors of young adult (YA) cancers experiences long-term risks across
multiple health domains, including impaired social connection, poor health behaviors, financial toxicity,
infertility, early onset chronic conditions, and second cancers. Access to and receipt of high-quality
survivorship care is therefore of paramount importance for YAs, who have many life-years to live. The parent
study (1R37CA256867-01) characterizes trajectories of social health in YAs from diagnosis through treatment
and beyond, investigates the longitudinal association between social health and activity behaviors in YA
survivors, and explores the effects of sociodemographics and clinical characteristics on the relationship
between social health, activity behaviors, and quality of life. Importantly, survivorship care also targets and
aims to improve these outcomes. Therefore, data on YAs’ access to, utilization, and quality of survivorship care
after completion of active treatment will enhance exploratory analyses of the parent study. In addition, the
growing number of survivorship clinics developed to serve older or younger populations may or may not
adequately address the unique issues survivors of YA cancers face. Understanding the degree to which
existing survivorship programs that serve YAs align with new National Standards for Survivorship Care
(“National Standards”) can inform the development of similar survivorship programs to serve this at-risk
demographic. Further, little to no existing research comprehensively characterizes access to survivorship care
among racially and ethnically diverse survivors of YA cancers, who experience disparities in survivorship
outcomes. A nuanced understanding of access from the perspective of diverse survivors of YA cancers is
needed to guide efforts to increase access and address health inequities. To address these gaps, we propose
a mixed methods study to characterize survivorship care delivery to YAs at an academic comprehensive
cancer center which includes a large safety net hospital. Aim 1: Assess the extent to which there is alignment
between the National Standards for Survivorship Care and an academic cancer center survivorship program
that serves diverse YAs. Aim 2: Assess survivorship care utilization and access, including barriers and
facilitators, among diverse survivors of YA cancers obtaining care within a) an academic cancer center
survivorship program and b) the surrounding community. Aim 3: Develop a brief report that synthesizes
findings and identifies multi-level gap areas for future development and disseminate to NCI and stakeholders.
Findings of this study will illuminate opportunity areas for YA cancer survivorship care delivery in alignment
with the new National Standards, and, thereby, inform efforts to develop and implement high-quality
survivorship programs that serve and engage diverse YA survivors."
11103008,"Project Summary (Parent Award)
Chronic pain is a significant public health burden for which there are few effective treatments;
individuals with chronic pain are a central component to the current opioid epidemic. Delta-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive chemical of cannabis, holds promise as a
therapeutic candidate to treat chronic pain. However, analgesia is accompanied by intoxication
and abuse liability, thus limiting its clinical utility. Terpenes are organic compounds that
contribute to the aromatic nature and flavor of cannabis; it has been hypothesized that these
compounds may interact synergistically with THC to enhance its therapeutic effects with
reduced adverse consequences. As such, terpenes may increase the analgesic effects of low,
minimally intoxicating, doses of THC, and/or reduce adverse consequences of higher THC
doses. Preclinical research demonstrates that the terpenes myrcene and ß-caryophyllene (BCP)
elicit antinociceptive effects and have opioid-sparing properties. These effects are, in part,
mediated by the mu-opioid receptor. It is unknown if these findings translate to humans.
Understanding if these terpenes have analgesic properties alone, or in combination with THC, is
fundamental to developing novel cannabinoid-based therapeutics to treat pain. In addition,
investigating adverse effects of these terpenes (abuse liability, intoxication) will clarify their
clinical potential. At a time when pharmacotherapeutic strategies to decrease reliance on
opioids for pain relief are desperately needed, probing the 1) analgesic effects, 2) potential
THC- and opioid-sparing properties, and 3) mechanism of these terpenes is of significant
interest. The proposed double-blind, placebo-controlled studies will be the first to rigorously
assess the dose-dependent analgesic effects of ecologically-relevant doses of myrcene and
BCP and determine their THC- and opioid-sparing effects. Study findings will be essential in
understanding the clinical potential of terpenes alone and in conjunction with THC for pain
management. The proposed double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject studies in
recreational cannabis smokers (N=30, 15M, 15F in each study) will first ascertain the dose-
dependent analgesic potential of vaporized myrcene and BCP alone and in combination with
sub-analgesic (5 mg) and analgesic (15 mg) doses of THC (Specific Aim 1). The myrcene/THC
and BCP/THC dose combinations that produce the greatest analgesia and minimal intoxication
and abuse liability will then be tested for their opioid sparing effects (Specific Aim 2). Opioid
modulation of combined terpene/THC analgesia will be assessed with co-administration of
naltrexone, an opioid antagonist (Specific Aim 2). Findings from these studies address a
significant public health priority by investigating terpenes as a safe, well tolerated novel
pharmacotherapeutic strategy to manage pain. This is an urgent area of research as
alternatives to opioids and strategies to decrease use of high opioid doses are desperately
needed."

Thisapplication is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as ""NOT-CA-
24-041."" This proposed descriptive research aims to evaluate the processes, policies, and
evaluation/assessment metrics of the head and neck cancer (HNC) survivorship care program at Memorial
Hermann Health System and how these processes, policies, and evaluation/assessment metrics align with the
recently developed National Standards for Cancer Survivorship Care. Memorial Hermann Health System
provides cancer care for a diverse head and neck cancer (HNC) population residing in 13 counties (7 urban, 6
rural), offering a unique opportunity to evaluate differences across urban and rural populations. Cancer
survivorship care programs are a core component of quality care for patients with HNC, who are treated
aggressively with multi-modal therapies, increasing the HNC 5-year survival rate from 60% in 1995 to 69% in
2020, expanding the HNC survivor population to 522,846. This improved survival rate comes with a human cost
of a profound symptom burden, leading to a lower quality of life and adverse events, such as hospitalizations,
which significantly alter the trajectory of patients' lives. Evidence-based, multidisciplinary cancer survivorship
care programs can markedly improve cancer survivors' quality of life and prevent premature death. Yet, many
patients with HNC do not receive survivorship care. For patients living in rural areas, access to HNC cancer
survivorship services may be even more limited and fragmented, creating disparities in HNC outcomes between
urban and rural areas, with worse survival for the black rural population. Research to identify the gaps in policy,
processes, and evaluation strategies of survivorship programs in healthcare systems serving rural populations
is limited and critically needed to enhance HNC survivorship care. This proposed research addresses these gaps
by obtaining a holistic view of the alignment of Memorial Hermann's HNC survivorship program with the National
Standards for Cancer Survivorship Care using quantitative and qualitative research approaches. The study
hypothesis is that patients with HNC residing in urban areas receive greater survivorship services than those
residing in rural areas. The specific aims are: 1) Assess the alignment of head and neck cancer (HNC)
survivorship care program at Memorial Hermann Health System with the National Standards for Cancer
Survivorship Care using surveys; 2) Compare and contrast the extent to which the HNC cancer survivorship care
program serves patients with HNC at Memorial Hermann Health System across urban and rural settings (n=250);
and 3) Identify facilitators and barriers to accessing survivorship care by patients with HNC in urban and rural
settings through interviews with patients (urban 3, rural 3), HNC Clinicians (urban 2, rural 2), and health system
administrators (urban 2, rural 2). Ultimately, this proposed research will identify future strategies to enhance HNC
survivorship programs serving patients in urban and rural settings."
11110743,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Viral infection outcomes are sex-biased, with males generally more susceptible to human cytomegalovirus
(HCMV) and other viral infections compared to females. These differences may reflect sexual dimorphism in
immune cell composition and function. As such, it is surprising that numbers of natural killer (NK) cells, a first
line of defense against HCMV, are increased in males compared to females. Here we show in mouse models
and human samples that while males harbor increased NK cell numbers, they produce less IFN-γ, a critical pro-
inflammatory cytokine for NK-mediated anti-viral responses. This difference is not due to divergent levels of
gonadal hormones, since these differences are still present in gonadectomized mice. Instead, a screen for X
chromosome genes that escape inactivation and demonstrate sexually dimorphic expression in NK cells
identified UTX, an epigenetic regulator that alters transcriptional programs through reorganization of chromatin.
NK cell-specific UTX deletion phenocopies multiple features of male NK cells, which include increased NK
numbers and reduced IFN-γ production. Thus, we hypothesize that NK cell sex differences can be attributed to
differential expression of X-linked UTX, which reorganizes chromatin at loci important in NK cell fitness and
function. In Aim 1, we will define UTX-mediated temporal control of NK cell numbers and determine whether
differences in cellular fitness underlie differences in NK cell homeostasis in males compared to females. In Aim
2, we will delineate UTX’s role in promoting NK cell cytotoxic activity and whether lower UTX levels in male NK
cells also impairs their cytotoxic capacity. In Aim 3, we will delineate molecular mechanisms by which UTX
controls chromatin accessibility and gene expression at loci important for NK cell homeostasis and function.
Knowledge gained from completion of these studies will contribute to our basic understanding of sex differences
in anti-viral responses and NK cells. A deeper understanding of sex differences will benefit human health overall
by revealing new targets for immunotherapy and guiding interventions for optimizing anti-viral immunity."

Persons of color (POC) from underserved communities are at increased risk of COVID-19 related morbidity
and mortality due to a variety of social and structural health determinants (SSDH; e.g., barriers to health care
access) and higher rates of underlying chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular
disease. Additionally, stressors associated with experiences of racism/discrimination (personal and systemic)
and the impact of the pandemic on their communities may further complicate the recovery and management of
underlying chronic diseases for minority COVID-19 survivors, undermining the mental and physical health not
only of the patient but carepartners who provide critical support. This study tests the efficacy of a telehealth-

Community-based Intervention Under Nurse Guidance with Families), on quality of life (QoL), and health-
related outcomes in vulnerable African American (AA) adults with preexisting chronic illness and their informal
carepartners (IC). Adapted from our previous WISSDOM CINGs model tested in AA stroke patients, key
features of this intervention include a)
strategies to address racial- and pandemic-related stressors perceived
by COVID-19 survivors and ICs; and b) incorporation of the survivor/IC dyad as a unit of analysis to better
understand how interpersonal and interdependent relationships impact health and health related outcomes for
both partners. We hypothesize that survivor/IC dyads receiving the intervention (i.e., coaching related to
COVID-19 risk mitigation, chronic disease management information, and assistance navigating the health care
system) will demonstrate improved QoL and health-related secondary outcomes compared to the attention
control arm receiving monthly general health promotion. The objective of iCINGS FAM is to strengthen the
efficacy and agency of the dyad to manage illness behaviors as an integrated unit, termed ""dyad illness
management. In Aim 1, we will conduct interviews and focus groups with key community stakeholders to refine
iCINGS FAM components to the individual, interpersonal, community, social environment, and SSDH
assets/barriers of study dyads. In Aim 2, we will employ an RCT design to test intervention efficacy on QoL of
adult AA survivors and ICs (250 dyads) with pre-existing chronic health conditions. Intervention effects on
symptoms, dyadic confidence, and social support will also be investigated (Aim 2.1). In Aim 3, we will identify
individual - and family - level social and structural racial trauma exposures and family illness management
behaviors associated with reduced/improved QoL and health outcomes on a subset of dyads (n=50). Finally, to
further contextualize study findings, in Exploratory Aim 4 we will examine associations between outcomes
and community-level SSDH using PhenX structural determinant variables. This intervention has the potential to
reduce health disparities and increase understanding of SSDH, sociodemographic and psychosocial factors
that affect QoL and dyadic illness management behaviors in minority patients."

Neuronascent (NNI) discovered a unique therapy for Alzheimer’s, NNI-362, that promotes adult-
born neurons to replace lost neurons, while protecting from degeneration. In NNI’s completed
Phase1a trial, NNI-362 demonstrated safety and significant reduction of brain phosphoTau181.
The aim is to follow up the Ph1a with a Phase 2 trial in AD, for which the following 4 specific
aims are necessary. 1) NNI requires further GMP manufacture and 2) liquid-gel cap formulation
of NNI-362; 3) the long-term (6-months) safety in M/F rats and dogs; and 4) regular IND updates
and a meeting with FDA to discuss the Phase 2 clinical plan. This unique drug could be
beneficial for AD by limiting phosphoTau pathology and promoting new neurons to reverse
disease over a six-month period.
In the first aim, Onyx Scientific will scale-up NNI-362 from the 1 kg cGMP method used for
Phase 1a, to the >5 kg cGMP required for completion of Phase 2-3. Secondly, NNI-362 clinical
product will then be formulated into a liquid-gel capsule prepared at 120 mg/capsule, already
shown safe and potentially efficacious in aged subjects. Patheon prepared the formulation used
in Phase1a, and determined the practicality of the liquid-gel cap with NNI-362.
Thirdly, Charles River will complete a dog and rat (M/F) GLP safety testing for 6-months, as
required by FDA for treatment of humans for the same 6-month period. The doses will be the
same as the completed 14day/14day washout study in rats at 10, 50 and 150 mg/kg and in dogs
at 15, 45 and 210 mg/kg po daily. Charles River has considerable experience in carrying out
FDA-approved GLP safety studies. Lastly, regulatory contractors CCS Associates will provide
yearly regulatory IND-update filings and will request a FDA meeting to discuss the Phase 2
clinical trial plan for mild to moderate AD patients.
With decades of AD drug failures, NNI used human neural cell screen to discover a “neuron
generating and neuroprotective” drug. Pre-clinical studies of NNI-362 demonstrated new
hippocampal neurons in aging and disease models, and neuroprotection to allow new neuron
integration that reversed behavioral deficits. Phase 1a in healthy aged subjects demonstrated
safety and indicated that NNI-362, provided significant reduction of AD-progression marker
phosphoTau181 after only 16 days of treatment period in human aged subjects. With longer term
treatment of AD patients, NNI-362 has the potential to not only slow progression of AD over the
short-term, but promote new neurons to fully reverse disease, long-term."

Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most common cancer globally in people living with HIV, and among the most common cancers in Sub-Saharan Africa, and is caused by infection by the Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV, also called HHV-8). This virus also causes primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). While PEL is rare, it is an aggressive malignancy with few therapeutic options. KSHV-associated diseases are difficult to model because this virus is species-specific, it does not transform cells in in culture, in vitro infection frequently leads to a mixture of latent and lytic viral gene expression, and related animal viruses do not cause the same pathologies. Furthermore, KS lesions are composed of a mixture of cells that include latently KSHV-infected spindle cells and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate that includes numerous CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, plasma cells, macrophages, and mast cells. While substantial attention has been given to the histogenesis of the spindle cells, the immune infiltrates in KS lesions have only been superficially and incompletely described. The overarching goal is this application is develop preclinical in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models of KSHV-associated diseases, including KS, MCD and lymphoma. To model KS, we will apply observations from human lesions, and include the immune elements of this disease. This will be accomplished through the following specific aims: 1) conditional expression of major latency transcript genes in immunocompetent mice; 2) examine the tumor immune environment in KS lesions in patients and test the role of major immune subsets in mice; and 3) engineer synthetic, in vitro and ex vivo Kaposi sarcoma-like tissue niches for controlled growth of healthy and diseased primary endothelial cells. We will examine the effects of first line therapeutic approaches, targeted therapy and immunotherapy in these models to validate them for preclinical use."
11116004,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Individual humans and animals can lie anywhere along a continuum of high to low risk-
taking propensity. Several neuropsychiatric conditions are characterized by extremes of risk-taking propensity.
For example, patients with pathological anxiety or anorexia nervosa show high risk aversion, while patients
with gambling disorder, or substance use disorder exhibit low risk aversion. Both high and low risk-taking
propensity are thought to drive and maintain maladaptive behavior in these disorders. Therefore, novel
pharmacological agents that shift risk-taking propensity closer to population mean values could provide novel
treatments for these disorders. Although risky decision-making paradigms exist for humans and animals,
behavioral assays that also elicit robust and translationally relevant neurophysiological markers are lacking.
Here, we propose to optimize, pharmacologically test, and mechanistically probe a novel in vivo behavioral and
neurophysiological assay to be used for translational studies and for screening for novel drugs to treat
psychiatric conditions associated with high or low aversion to risk. Recent work in wild-type rats suggests that
the activity of dopamine receptor 2 expressing medium spiny neurons (D2-MSNs) in the nucleus accumbens
core (NAcC) encodes prior outcomes and predicts future choices during a risky decision-making operant task.
First, we will manipulate operant task parameters to establish that the task fully captures both extremes of risk-
taking propensity, and also measures constructs underlying risky decision-making, including reward and loss
sensitivity, motivation, and goal-directed versus habitual responding. We will also identify neurophysiological
markers of risky versus safe choices during the task using fiber photometry and whole brain local field
potentials (LFP). We predict that during the decision period immediately preceding safe or risky lever selection,
increases in both NAcC D2-MSN activity and theta oscillations within a corticostriatal circuit including the
NAcC/ventral striatum (VS), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), will precede safe
choices. In contrast, we predict that decreases in NAcC D2-MSN activity and theta activity within this
corticostriatal circuit will precede risky choices. Theta activity within corticostriatal brain regions will provide a
non-invasive and translationally relevant neurophysiological marker of risk-propensity, while NAcC D2-MSN
activity will provide a marker of risk-propensity for drug screening using animals. Second, we will test whether
drugs with known effects on risky decision-making in humans produce the same effects on the behavior of rats
in the optimized paradigm. We will assess the effects of the dopamine D2/D3 agonist pramipexole, which
increases problem gambling in Parkinson’s Disease, and the D2/D3 antagonist sulpiride, which increases risk
aversion in humans. We will also determine drug effects on NAcC D2-MSN activity and corticostriatal theta.
Third, we will use intra-NAcC drug infusions and optogenetics to test whether changes in NAcC D2-MSN
activity during the decision period of the operant task plays a causal role in safe versus risky decision-making."

Therapeutic Development
FOA type: PAR-19-289:
Abstract: The high failure rate of translating discovery science to positive clinical outcomes in the treatment of
psychiatric diseases demonstrates the necessity of improving the efficiency and rigor of the therapeutic
development pipeline. To this end, the critical importance of advancing the discovery of in vivo physiological and
behavioral measures of the engagement of specific circuits for normal cognitive function has been acknowledged
across funding initiatives. The hippocampus (HPC)-prefrontal cortical (PFC) circuit is critical for affective
processing as well as higher cognitive functions and vulnerable in a number of mental health disorders. Although
disrupted functional connectivity in the HPC-PFC circuit is a common feature of anxiety, bipolar disorder,
schizophrenia, and autism, how local cellular interactions within this circuit manifest as large-scale temporal
coordination to support higher cognitive functions remains unknown. Addressing this fundamental gap in our
knowledge will establish a foundation for using circuit-based models for therapeutic target discovery and
screening tools of novel drug efficacy. The long-term goal of this proposal, in line with the Funding Opportunity
Announcement (PAR-19-289), is to enhance the therapeutic development pipeline for mental illness treatment
by optimizing, evaluating, and mechanistically testing neurophysiological and behavioral measures of circuit
engagement. The primary objective of this proposal, which is the first step towards achieving our goal, is to relate
behavioral performance on the rodent analog on the Paired Associates Learning task (PAL), part of human
Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Batteries [CANTAB] assessment, and surface EEG recordings
to invasive neurophysiological measures of neural coordination in the HPC-PFC circuit. Through an innovative
series of experiments that integrate in vivo neurophysiological local field potential (LFP) recordings, circuit
manipulation, surface EEG, and behavior, we will optimize, evaluate and mechanistically test novel noninvasive
biomarkers of HPC-PFC circuit engagement by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) Optimize behavioral and
non-invasive EEG biomarkers for inferring HPC-PFC circuit engagement and temporal coordination, 2)
Evaluation of behavioral and non-invasive EEG biomarkers for determining HPC-PFC circuit engagement
through pharmacological manipulation, and 3) Mechanistically test HPC-PFC projections as a driver of surface
EEG organization. The proposed research is innovative because it integrates a clinically relevant behavioral
task, designed to be analogous to human cognitive assessments, with surface EEG measures that translate
across mammals. This will enable the optimization, evaluation, and testing of novel and translatable measures
of HPC-PFC circuit engagement in the context of higher cognition and global neural organization. The
significance of this contribution will be to provide novel diagnostic tools that can be used to enhance the
therapeutic development pipeline for treating mental illness."

The program will strengthen patient-oriented HIV clinical investigation training of physician-scientists and
other exceptional clinicians in Mwanza, in northwestern Tanzania. The program builds upon two decades of
collaboration and capacity building by the partner institutions. The primary research institution in Tanzania will
be the Mwanza Intervention Trials Unit (MITU), which is a unit of Tanzania's National Institute for Medical
Research (NIMR). MITU was established in 2006 as a collaboration between NIMR and the London School
of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) to strengthen HIV interventional research in Tanzania. MITU
collaborates closely with the Weill Bugando School of Medicine, which is also located in Mwanza. Weill
Bugando was established in 2003 to train physicians for northwestern Tanzania. MITU and Weill Bugando
have collaborated with Weill Cornell Medical College since their founding.
This research training program aims to fill a critical gap in Mwanza: the need for Tanzanian physicians with
rigorous training in patient-oriented HIV clinical investigation. We use the NIH definition of clinical
investigation as research which directly interacts with individual patients or clusters of patients in Phase I, II, or
III clinical trials, pragmatic trials, or formative epidemiologic or behavioral research in preparation for clinical
trials. The goals of the proposed training program are: 1.To increase the number of clinical investigators at
MITU and thereby increase institutional capacity for HIV clinical investigation 2. Establish Weill Bugando/MITU
as a sustainable training center for HIV clinical investigation. The ultimate goal is to prevent new HIV
infections, provide effective HIV care, and improve HIV outcomes in Tanzania and East Africa.
We will provide long-term training to fifteen outstanding clinician scientists to conduct patient-oriented HIV
clinical investigation. We will primarily train physicians but will also train exceptional other clinicians (PharmD,
DMD). We will train 10 PhDs, and 5 MS degree candidates. Tanzanian trainees will benefit from participation
in 17 active research projects in five synergistic areas of HIV investigation including HIV prevention and
vaccine research, implementation of HIV testing and treatment, women's health, HIV related co-infections, and
HIV and cardiovascular disease. We will also strengthen the PhD program in clinical investigation at Weill
Bugando by introducing 4 new graduate courses in clinical investigation. Weill Cornell is committing
institutional funds so that 4 of the best PhD graduates can have 2-year post-doctoral appointments as
MITU research scientists after their Fogarty training. At the end of the 5-year training program, MITU will have
a cadre of clinical investigators and a greater depth and breadth of externally funded HIV patient-oriented
research. MITU/Weill Bugando will be a training hub for HIV clinical investigators in East Africa."
10994224,"Intestinal epithelial cells reside at the direct interface between the microbiota and mammalian
host, and are thus uniquely poised to sense microbial signals that calibrate intestinal immunity
and function. Tuft cells are a specialized epithelial cell that have recently been shown to respond
to microbial stimuli and initiate and amplify type 2 immune responses in the intestine. However,
despite a clear relationship between the microbiota and intestinal health, the mechanisms
underlying how the microbiota instruct tuft cell homeostasis and function remain poorly
understood. Epigenetics represent a central mechanism that can potentially link microbial triggers
in the pathogenesis of intestinal disease. Consistent with this concept, we previously identified
that epithelial loss of an epigenetic-modifying enzyme disrupted microbiota-sensitive intestinal
homeostasis and increased susceptibility to intestinal damage. Our new preliminary data suggest
that regulation of tuft cell development and homeostasis may be epigenetically regulated and
dynamically controlled by distinct metabolites produced by the intestinal microbiota. Based on
these findings, we hypothesize that (1) tuft cell responses in the intestine may be calibrated by
distinct components of the microbiota through an epigenetic sensor and that (2) epigenetic
mechanisms in stem cells may regulate tuft cell development and function. To investigate these
hypotheses, we will (i) interrogate how distinct commensal bacterial-derived metabolites instruct
intestinal stem cell differentiation to tuft cells through an epigenetic-modifying enzyme, and (ii)
directly identify and investigate new mechanisms by which the stem cell epigenetic landscape
can be modulated to control tuft cell differentiation in the intestine. This work will uncover novel
epigenetically-regulated pathways that direct tuft cell biology in the intestine, and therefore guide
personalized approaches for treating intestinal diseases."

successful GloCal Health Fellowship (GloCal). Our LMIC sites are well-established, work in regions with some
of the highest burden of disease, and stand to benefit from our program’s capacity building, mentorship training
and alumni support. GloCal is the only UC-wide global health training program, and our track record shows that
we: 1) Recruit pre- and postdoctoral trainees diverse in discipline and race [39% of U.S. trainees over the past
5 years identify as an underrepresented minority (URM)] who aspire to build interdisciplinary academic
research careers in global health; 2) Provide outstanding, interdisciplinary education and training in global
health in collaboration with faculty mentors from participating UC campuses and collaborating LMIC
institutions; and 3) Provide each trainee with a rich and enduring mentored research experience that fosters
scientific and career development in global health. The program also advances long-term objectives to 1)
Develop models of interdisciplinary, innovative global health research and training designed to ensure healthy
lives and promote well-being for all; 2) Enhance global health networks between the UC and our LMIC partners
and recruit faculty leading innovative global health research; and 3) Strengthen a sustainable and equitable
model of collaboration between the UC and our LMIC partners that develops research capacity that advances
locally-led and locally-relevant research. GloCal will recruit candidates from a pipeline of 65 T32 and 13 D43
programs. GloCal trainees are at different career stages, but all receive: 1) A 9 or 12-month, hands-on
research experience onsite with one of our LMIC partners—LMIC fellows will spend their first 2 to 3 months of
the program at UC and earn a certificate in ‘conducting global health research’; 2) A strong, interdisciplinary
mentored research experience; 3) Instruction in global health through onsite and online courses; and 4) Career
development to ensure that they attain their short-term goals and succeed in transitioning to the next career
stage. GloCal leadership and standing committees ensure that these program components form a seamless,
integrated experience supported by evaluation and continuous improvement. Strengths and innovations of the
program include: 1) A unified consortium under UCGHI that includes four UCs at the leading edge of global
health 2) Recruitment of diverse U.S. trainees across UC and the UCLA-Charles Drew University partnership;
3) Mentors offering training across diverse disciplines (e.g., medicine, nursing, dentistry, public health,
veterinary science, environmental and social sciences) and in research methods; and 4) Leveraging common
resources across the four participating UC campuses (UCGHI, CTSAs and CFARs). UCGHI is committed to
supporting the success of GloCal, as evidenced by their pledge of $600,000 in co-funding."
10795897,"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects 15% of the US adult population 30 and vasopressin is
associated with progression of non-diabetic, diabetic, and polycystic kidney disease (PKD). 1-18
However, the specific mechanism(s) through which vasopressin worsens progression of kidney
disease are unclear. Vasopressin is the biologically active end-product of a 164 amino acid pre-
pro-peptide and physiologic production is currently thought to be limited to the brain. We
recently found that vasopressin is also made in the kidney under physiologic conditions and
expression is increased in PKD in both humans and mice. Therefore, the aim of this project is to
understand the function, regulation, and impact of kidney-derived vasopressin in health and
disease. We have preliminary data that show that mice that lack kidney-derived vasopressin in
the distal nephron have altered water balance. We propose to (1) determine the mechanism
through which kidney-derived vasopressin influences water balance and (2) determine if kidney-
derived vasopressin is involved cyst growth and progression of PKD. Successful completion of
this project will help clarify the mechanism(s) through which the interplay between local and
systemic vasopressin signaling impacts kidney disease, potentially identifying new therapeutic
targets and approaches for CKD and PKD. Work will occur in one of the largest and most
scientifically diverse nephrology divisions in the world, within the Vanderbilt University Medical
Center Department of Medicine. This project has already received extensive external (Harold
Amos Medical Faculty Development Award – 2020) and institutional support in the form of
financial support and a comprehensive career development plan involving internal and external
mentorship, workshops, and coursework."
11102479,"Project Summary
Left and right hemisphere (RH) strokes occur at similar frequencies and both are associated with life-altering
communication deficits. However, patients with RH stroke rarely receive speech-language intervention, likely because
they do not present with obvious language deficits like aphasia. Instead, they have difficulties engaging in typical
conversations which require understanding what a speaker means, especially when in opposition to what was actually
said, such as occurs in sarcasm, humor and metaphors. A specific deficit in the ability to understand others’ perspectives
and intended meanings, known as theory of mind (ToM) may be a primary cause of communication deficits and a
critical component of differential recovery after RH stroke. Inappropriately responding during conversation due to
misunderstandings of what a speaker knows and intends creates poor social interactions and negatively impacts
relationships. For those living with RH stroke, communication deficits have profoundly damaging effects on quality of
life. Our central hypothesis is that RH stroke causes discourse-level language deficits due to damage to brain areas
critical to ToM, an essential component of social communication. Our goal is to assess language and ToM abilities from
acute to chronic stages of RH stroke while collecting neuroanatomical and quality of life data. We will measure the
contribution of other social deficits including the processing of emotional prosody and non-verbal cues (e.g., facial
expressions) as well as cognitive deficits including working memory, executive function, and attention. To date,
estimates of language and ToM deficits which occur after RH stroke and the relationship between them are inconsistent
or unexplored. Most studies examine patients in rehabilitation settings who likely have large strokes and more severe
communication disorders, creating a bias in our knowledge about the effects of stroke. The effects of damage to RH
brain regions, their connections, and how they contribute to language recovery are also unknown, limiting decisions
about treatment priorities. Lastly, whether language recovery depends on ToM is unknown as there are no longitudinal
studies of communication recovery from acute RH stroke. We will address these gaps by examining individuals in a large
group of acute stroke subjects, as they progress from acute to chronic stroke to evaluate the relationship between
changes in language, ToM and their dependence on neural recovery. Our innovative approach combines recent
advances in neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging analysis to provide converging causal evidence to validate a
ToM theory of RH stroke communication. Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that language depends on intact ToM at the acute
stage of stroke before functional reorganization. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that language depends on ToM associated
neural structures and connectivity acutely, before functional reorganization. Aim 3 examines recovery of language and
relationships with ToM and brain structure by assessing behavioral and neural changes across the first year after stroke.
Successful outcomes include understanding the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying RH deficits, their
evolution post-stroke, and their impact on quality of life. As a result, we will be able to develop better assessment and
intervention tools, improving access to health care and long-term outcomes for this underserved patient population."
11116447,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly 3 million antibiotic resistant infections occur per year in the United States. This problem is especially acute
in gram-negative bacteria, where the outer membrane (OM) which surrounds the aqueous periplasm acts as a
permeability barrier capable of excluding many antibiotics. We are interested in the OM of Enterobacterales (e.g.,
Escherichia, Salmonella, Klebsiella), which are adapted to an enteric environment rich in toxic molecules, such
as bile salts, necessitating an especially strong OM. It has become clear that the permeability of the OM can be
altered by the physiological state of the cell. Specifically, stresses such as nutrient limitation can result in
strengthening of the OM permeability barrier. Elucidation of the pathways responsible for this strengthening will
lead to new targets for the development of small molecules that can weaken the OM permeability barrier. We
have found enterobacterial common antigen (ECA), a conserved component of the Enterobacterales OM and
periplasm, to be important for OM impermeability under stress. Two forms of ECA (phospholipid-linked ECA
(ECAPG), and cyclic ECA (ECACYC)) have different roles related to OM permeability; however, their precise
functions remain unknown, in part, because many steps in their biogenesis are poorly understood.
Our long-term goal is to understand the biogenesis of ECA to facilitate functional studies and identify potential
antimicrobial targets. Specifically, this project aims to elucidate, in Escherichia coli K12, the regulation of and
unknown steps in biogenesis of the forms of ECA contributing to antibiotic resistance. Biochemical reactions are
required for these forms of ECA to be produced and yet the genes responsible for these steps and the regulation
of these steps are largely unknown. The central hypothesis is that ECAPG and ECACYC can be differentiate
through their unique biosynthetic genes and regulatory roles. This hypothesis will be addressed with the following
aims: identify the genes and substrate necessary for ECA to become a phospholipid head group forming ECAPG
using genetic interactions with other biosynthesis pathways (Aim 1); elucidate factors and mechanisms involved
in ECACYC biogenesis using an antibiotic sensitivity suppression phenotype we discovered (Aim 2); and uncover
the mechanisms of the two novel pathways of ECA regulation we discovered (Aim 3). These conceptually
innovative aims will be approached through a blend of high-throughput genomics, genetic screens and
selections, and biochemical techniques. Completion of this project will identify genes and residues important for
biogenesis of ECAPG and ECACYC, which represent targets for development of small molecules weakening the
OM. In addition, this will allow genetic analyses of ECA function, providing insights into Enterobacterales biology."

This administrative supplement application seeks funding to expand the research objectives for the current
award, entitled “Brain Structure and Clinical Endpoint in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 2” (K23 NS125110). The
parent K23 award aims to evaluate the relationship between brain structure and function on cognition and
motor performance in adults with myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2). The proposed supplement will support a
DM2 biofluid repository initiative and collection of additional Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) biomarkers to sufficiently
address potential confounders from age-related comorbidities. DM2, a multisystemic disorder, results from a
CCTG repeat expansion in the CNBP gene, where the RNA gain-of-function is the main disease mechanism.
Although muscle weakness is the key feature in DM2, almost 70% of patients report that impaired cognition is
one of the most disabling symptoms, adversely affecting their quality of life. A sparse literature describes
cognitive deficits in executive function, attention, verbal memory, and processing speed in those with DM2. Yet
the mechanisms that lead to cognitive impairment in DM2 are poorly understood as brain imaging studies are
very limited. Nevertheless, most studies suggest that, compared to controls, DM2 primarily affects white matter
(WM), with reduced cerebral WM volume and impaired WM integrity derived from diffusion tensor imaging
(DTI). Emerging evidence has identified tau mis-splicing and tangle pathology in the brains of those with DM2,
which has prompted interest in elucidating the role of tau in DM2-related cognitive impairment. One method of
investigating central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms is to evaluate fluid biomarkers that reflect brain
pathology. But no studies to date have meticulously evaluated brain structure and their relationships to clinical
endpoints and biomarkers of CNS pathology in DM2. In Aim 1, I will evaluate brain morphometry and DTI
measures of WM integrity, including fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusivity (RD), and axial diffusivity (AD)
in 40 adults with DM2 vs. 40 age and sex-matched control. In Aim 2, I will determine relationships between
measures of WM integrity (FA and RD) and clinical (cognitive and motor) endpoints. In Aim 3, I will conduct a
pilot proof-of-concept study to characterize tau profiles in the plasma and CSF of DM2 and associate these
findings with measures of brain structure and cognitive endpoints. The original study did not adequately
address potential confounders from age-related comorbidities, i.e., preclinical AD. The requested funds will
enable me to examine plasma β-amyloid biomarkers (Aβ42, Aβ40) to help mitigate this concern. The
supplement will also establish a DM2 biofluid repository at the Biospecimen Exchange for Neurological
Disorders (BioSEND). By utilizing BioSEND’s infrastructure, this initiative will ensure the long-term preservation
of samples, foster collaborations, and facilitate access for the broader research community. Such samples will
add neuromuscular disease to the BioSEND’s repository, and accelerate advancements in DM2 research."

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are two of the most
devastating human malignancies in desperate need for improved treatment concepts. Treatment resistance in
cancer therapy frequently includes, among others, reduced drug uptake, increased drug efflux, improved
adaptation to chemotherapy-induced stress/DNA damage and inhibition of apoptosis. An example of such a
resistance mechanism is the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (XIAP), a potent negative regulator of
caspases and promoter of cancer cell survival in both ovarian and pancreatic cancer. Inhibition of XIAP has
been studied to increase apoptosis and to overcome drug resistance in vitro and in preclinical mouse models.
Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) is an endogenous inhibitor of both XIAP and
cellular IAP (cIAP) by reactivating caspase activity (XIAP blockade) and cIAP degradation, leading to cancer
cell death. These findings have initiated the development of synthetic small molecule mimics of endogenous
SMAC, which have been studied in a wide variety of human malignancies either as single agents but also in
combination with systemic chemotherapy as a means to further improve patient outcomes.
The foundation of our work with respect to small molecule drug development is based on sigma-2 ligands (S2)
that facilitate fast and selective uptake into the cancer cells due to ~10-fold higher abundancy of the
corresponding sigma-2 receptor (S2R) compared to normal host cells. By generating chemical conjugates
between S2 and a variety of small molecule drug cargos, we are now capable of delivering therapeutic
payloads more efficiently and selectively than their non-targeted counterparts to the tumors (targeted therapy).
LCL161 is a clinically explored IAP inhibitor (IAPinh) that induces target activation but failed to demonstrate
objective responses in patients. In this grant, we propose to study an innovative experimental cancer
therapeutic by chemically linking IAPinh (LCL161) to S2 ligand SW43, resulting in S2/IAPinh for tumor-
selective drug delivery and therapy. We hypothesize that S2/IAPinh can be combined with systemic, low-dose
chemotherapy to result in synergistic treatment regimens that lead to tumor eradication while systemic
toxicities are reduced to a minimum.
The overall goal of our current study is to find effective therapies for ovarian and pancreatic cancer. The
proposed aims maximize the chance that a novel drug candidate, S2/IAPinh, will be effective clinically. This is
envisioned either as single-agent, low-dose S2/IAPinh therapy in the context of a TNF-α gene signature in
patient tumors or as combination regimens with clinically approved pathway enhancers, such as Nab-paclitaxel
(Abraxane) (ovarian cancer) and Gemcitabine/Nab-paclitaxel (pancreatic cancer) but also statin-based
inhibitors of cholesterol de novo synthesis. Our new findings represent an exciting innovative opportunity to
enhance the activity profile of S2/IAPinh employing novel drug combinations for the benefit of cancer patients."

 Advances in antiretroviral therapy have made ending the HIV pandemic an increasingly plausible
prospect. Unfortunately, more than a million new HIV infections occur annually and no safe and scalable cure
for HIV exists. Underlying these public health and clinical problems are the viral mechanisms by which HIV
adapts to new hosts and establishes and maintains a latent state in infected cells. This project takes a novel
approach to understanding these pathologic processes by addressing how an essential viral regulatory
mechanism contributes to HIV transmission and latency.
 The HIV Rev-Rev Response Element (RRE) system is a viral regulatory axis that is essential for
replication. Differences in Rev-RRE activity level are observed among primary isolates and impact replication
kinetics and the relative expression of viral proteins. Rev-RRE variations in HIV and other complex retroviruses
can directly impact pathogenesis and provide a mechanism by which the virus adapts to differing fitness
landscapes. Despite this, little is known about how Rev-RRE variation affects transmission capacity or how this
system contributes to latency. This project interrogates these issues in three aims. First, the role of Rev-RRE
variation in navigating the sexual transmission bottleneck is defined. Second, the contribution of the Rev-RRE
axis to latency establishment, maintenance, and reversal is explored. Third, the project investigates how Rev-
RRE activity contributes to the anatomic distribution of the latent reservoir.
 In each aim, single genome HIV sequences acquired in well-defined clinical scenarios are used to
identify unique Rev-RRE pairs. Then, a novel high-throughput fluorescence based assay is used to determine
the Rev-RRE functional activity of hundreds of primary isolates. By comparing Rev-RRE activity in single hosts
over time or in single hosts in different anatomic compartments, Rev-RRE functional variation and the role for
this in HIV pathogenesis can be determined.
 This project will improve the current understanding of viral processes that contribute to transmission
and latency. While both of these mechanisms are well studied, existing models of transmission fitness and
latency do not include a contribution of Rev-RRE activity variation. Successful completion of the project holds
out the prospect of future improved interventions for infection prevention. Ultimately, it may also advance a
cure by pointing to new ways to improve latency reversal."

health care, and Veterans' health and functioning in their communities. CCDOR's vision is to elevate the
quality, consistency and equity of health care and outcomes for all Veterans through innovative health services
and implementation research. Building on 20 years of success, this application proposes the renewal of
CCDOR as a VA HSR&D Center of Innovation (COIN) at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System (MVAHCS).
The name of the Center has been modified to reflect the Center's strategic goals while preserving the CCDOR
acronym and identity recognition. Over the next 5 years, CCDOR's strategic plan focuses on 2 high priority
areas in which CCDOR's expertise and partnerships are exceptionally strong and where CCDOR is uniquely
positioned to make substantial and meaningful contributions to improving Veteran health and health care: (1)
Trauma Recovery, and (2) Chronic Pain and Opioid Harms Reduction. These priority areas are of critical
importance to Veterans and their families and are aligned with the VA priorities to enhance foundational
services, improve timeliness, and suicide prevention, as well as the Federal Pain Research Strategy.
CCDOR's strategic goals are:
1. Conduct research to improve health care, health care experience and outcomes among Veterans with
 posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other trauma-related disorders. (Priority 1)
2. Conduct research to reduce opioid-related harms and improve health and functional outcomes for Veterans
 with chronic pain. (Priority 2)
3. Support and conduct impactful and innovative health services research to discover and support delivery of
 evidence-based practices on cancer prevention and control, healthy aging, and other important topics
 outside CCDOR's 2 priority areas. (Additional Research)
4. Train health services researchers to conduct high impact, partner-oriented and implementation-focused
 research and to become leaders in VA and national health care. (Mentoring and Training)
CCDOR is a vibrant health services research center of 26 core investigators leading research in Trauma
Recovery (Priority 1) and Chronic Pain and Opioid Harms Reduction (Priority 2), as well as conducing and
promoting research in additional areas. CCDOR's research is enabled by a management structure that
includes experienced and dedicated leaders and six Cores to facilitate Center functioning, training and
research. The CCDOR Evidence Synthesis and Implementation Cores are known nationally for their
methodological expertise and contributions to Veteran health care. CCDOR's Statistics and Data Management
Core not only enables CCDOR research but develops new methods and serves as a resource for operational
partners, informatics groups and researchers across VHA. The Veterans Engagement Core has expertise in
community engagement and Community Based Participatory Research and is using both Veteran Engagement
Studios and Veteran Advisory Panels to engage Veterans in CCDOR research. CCDOR has deep and strong
partnerships with VA Program Offices, including the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, the
National Center for PTSD, and National Pain Management. These partnerships help to ensure the value and
impact of Center research. Therefore, CCDOR is well-equipped to achieve its strategic goals, undertake the
projects described in this proposal and thereby improve care delivery, Veteran engagement in health care, and
Veterans' health and functioning in their communities."
11102216,"PROGRAM SUMMARY
The objective of our LAUNCH program is to continue our global health research training program
called the Global Health Equity Scholars (GHES) designed to create a new community of
researchers, educators, and professionals who are prepared to address new and emerging global
health challenges. We will build on the last nine years of this training program to create a cadre of
new researchers who will dedicate their research careers to address the health problems that arise
out of the inequity of human conditions prevalent in informal human settlements (slums). Rather
than addressing one disease at a time, we propose to provide a comprehensive, multidisciplinary,
and integrated approach to deal with urban and rural informal human settlement health issues,
developed over many years by the participating faculty members of this program. This program
will comprise four US partner institutions (Consortium) - Yale University, Stanford University,
University of Arizona, and University of California at Berkeley, each led by a leader in global health
research with more than 10 years of collaboration among themselves. Together, core faculty
mentors from these institutions conduct research at 25 institutions in 21 countries, representing
regions of Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Asia, the Pacific, and Eastern
Europe. The GHES program will address a wide range of health research topics including
HIV/AIDs, emerging and high-consequence infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases
(NCDs), women's health, environmental health, mental health, interpersonal violence, substance
abuse, injuries, and the interaction of all of these health issues within the framework of slum health.
Training will target US postdoctoral fellows and pre-doctoral students and low and middle-income
country (LMIC) postdoctoral fellows. We plan to recruit 9-10 trainees/year with 60% of them as US
postdoctoral fellows. The trainees will spend 10-12-months at an LMIC site under the supervision
of the Consortium and their collaborating LMIC mentors. Didactic workshops on global health
research methods will be conducted both in-person and online. LMIC trainees will spend 2-3
months at US institutionsto undergo training in methods not provided at their institutions. All of the
trainees will be provided with research and career mentorship throughout their training and tracked
for career development after completion of their GHES-supported research work. Thus, under this
program, we expect the trainees to be exposed to one important theme in global health research
- health equity - through research that deals with health concerns of vulnerable populations residing
in informal human settlements and provide them with an opportunity to become experts in this new
global health discipline. The overall impact of this training program is, therefore, to create a new
cadre of global health researchers and leaders who address the emerging health issues arising
out of ever-expanding informal human settlements of LMICs."
11113631,"Summary:
 Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in world and incidence of the
disease is expected to steadily rise. Levodopa therapy has been the standard treatment strategy for PD patients
for nearly 60 years and while it is effective in alleviating many motor symptoms in the early stages of PD, I it is
plagued by the induction of dyskinesia is late stage patients. Hence, there is a major medical need for 1)
symptomatic therapies that do not have the side-effect profile of levodopa and 2) better therapeutic strategies
for alleviating LID. Our central thesis is that striatal cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) are pivotal
determinants of the striatal pathophysiology underlying both PD motor symptoms and LID –
making them prime targets for the development of new therapies. While it has long been appreciated
that aberrant striatal cholinergic signaling is a contributing factor in the motor symptoms of PD, the mechanisms
underlying this linkage have not been fully delineated. The mechanisms underlying LID are even less well
understood. Current thinking has focused upon the direct actions of levodopa-derived dopamine (DA) on the
principal neurons of the striatum. However, several lines of evidence, including new results presented in this
application, suggest that a particular class of interneuron that releases acetylcholine is not just important, but
necessary for LID. Moreover, our preliminary studies provide a mechanistic foundation for this observation,
suggesting that alterations in the properties of principal neurons actually trigger aberrant activity in interneurons
– reconciling the two apparently discrepant scientific perspectives. In addition, our preliminary work establishes
the importance of interneuron-dependent, striatal remodeling not only when striatal DA levels are high (so-
called on-state), but also when DA levels are low and movement is so difficult (off-state). Far from being a passive
period, the striatal circuitry is being distorted during this period, contributing to the severity of the dyskinesia
during the next on-state. Indeed, an FDA-approved and well-tolerated drug when administered during the off-
state significantly alleviates LID in a mouse model. But much remains to be done if these exciting new discoveries
are to be translated into new treatments for PD patients. We propose to take advantage of a collection of new
tools to pursue four specific aims in rodent models: 1) characterize the determinants of ChI activity and
ACh release in PD and LID states; 2) characterize how ChI activity directly modulates SPNs in
PD and LID states; 3) characterize how ChI activity indirectly modulates SPNs through
intrastriatal GABAergic networks in LID states; 4) characterize how ChI activity remodels the
functional connectomes of SPNs in PD and LID states. Although these aims are ambitious and beyond
the reach of a modular R01, they are within the grasp of the outstanding, interactive team we have assembled for
this non-modular proposal – putting novel therapies for PD patients on the event horizon."

(PRaCTICE) Network Research Hub (NRH) is a partnership between the Oregon Rural Practice-based
Research Network (ORPRN), the WWAMI (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho) region
Practice and Research Network (WPRN) and their institutions’ Clinical and Translational Science Award
(CTSA) programs. The PRaCTICE team has over two decades of experience partnering with 308 clinics
and communities in rural and low-resourced settings on research, education, and technical assistance
projects – including nearly 100 clinical research studies since 2019 (65 completed, 33 active). While 29%
(932/3160) of the census tracks across the six Western states are in rural designated locations (RUCA 4-
10), 76% of the priority year 1 clinical sites (N=29 clinics) we partner with in PRaCTICE are rural.
PRaCTICE will be co-led by the Directors of ORPRN and WPRN, strengthen established partnerships with
clinical sites in rural settings, and consists of four cores: Community Engagement, Recruitment & Trials,
Data Coordination, and Communications & Dissemination. Together these cores will work to successfully
accrue participants for existing primary care-based NIH studies and codesign future studies relevant to
primary care clinics and communities in rural and underserved settings. Notably, our approach builds on
established processes to support study codesign and infrastructure that extends beyond individual projects.
PRaCTICE is anticipated to have a substantial positive impact in adopting and implementing research
advances into clinical care, growing primary care engagement, and advancing health equity for rural and
other underserved communities."

This application is for a Diversity Supplement to fund an enthusiastic young Hispanic female neuroscience
graduate from the University of Florida, Isabella Fleites. Isabella wants to strengthen her research
experience in sensory neurobiology and build a solid foundation for future graduate studies so that she can
build her career in neuroscience. Isabella feels that although her science background is strong, she needs
experience in molecular and cellular approaches to prepare her for competitive graduate programs.
My laboratory is ideally suited to helping Isabella succeed in her goals. She will learn key experimental skills
to supplement her background in the sciences. Specifically, my colleagues and I will train her to conduct in
vivo confocal Ca2+ imaging to record activity in gustatory receptor cells and in sensory ganglion neurons.
This involves learning delicate surgical procedures on genetically engineered (transgenic) mice, operating
computer-controlled sensory stimulation and confocal video image capture, and carrying out sophisticated
data analyses using advanced software apps. In addition to these technical skills, Isabella will learn how to
interpret complex data and to develop new experimental approaches to existing problems. By daily
interactions with others in my laboratory and in the laboratory of my collaborator, Dr. Nirupa Chaudhari, an
eminent molecular biologist, as well as via weekly joint laboratory meetings, Isabella will learn how to
interact as a peer with other researchers, how to share ideas, how to solve problems, and how to
communicate science. I have considerable experience and established success mentoring young scientists.
Dr. Chaudhari and our lab staff are also eager to assist Isabella.
The goals of this Diversity Supplement are to:
 · introduce Isabella to new research skillsꟷin vivo confocal Ca2+ imagingꟷto add to her formal
 neuroscience research training and to carry out an semi-independent project that is within the scope
 of ongoing studies in the parent grant, R01 DC018733, “Functions of gustatory afferent neuron types”,
 MPI's S Roper and N Chaudhari.
 · mentor Isabella in experimental design, analysis, and data interpretation. In addition to my own effort,
 this will be aided by informal daily interactions among members of two active research laboratories
 (Drs. Roper, Chaudhari) as well as via weekly joint laboratory meetings, periodic departmental
 seminars, and presenting findings at an annual campus neuroscience fair as well as a national
 conference (AChemS, SFN, or both).
 · allow Isabella to attend workshops and short courses in statistics, computation and molecular
 neuroscience provided by the university to extend her skill and knowledge set.
 · provide Isabella with an intense training background and portfolio of publication(s) to enable her to
 compete for a PhD program at a ranking national institution, with the ultimate goal of developing her

 Analyses of MOUD access and medically treated overdoses in samples of Medicare disability beneficiaries
(MDBs) have provided important insights, but it is vital to extend these to incorporate linkage with the National
Death Index (NDI) to better understand predictors of fatal overdoses involving opioids and health system
strategies to reduce them. Particularly critical is the need for firmer understanding of treatment history, clinical,
demographic, community, and other factors associated with increasing fatal-overdose risk among minoritized
communities, using 100% Medicare data with the statistical power to support accurate assessment across
racial/ethnic subgroups and communities, providing insights with broad significance for overdose prevention
across populations and payers. Under new CMS policies, NDI-claims linkage is available only in CMS’s Virtual
Data Research Warehouse (VRDC) through purchase of a VRDC seat. At the same time, newly-available data
from a 100% NDI-claims match now in the VRDC offer an opportunity to expand statistical power and
outcomes assessment to accurately measure MOUD uptake and fatal-overdose risk. Linkage of NDI data with
diagnostic and treatment histories from Medicare claims for the full MDB population offers a unique, timely
opportunity to improve statistically significant estimation across subgroups and communities from the original
sample of fee-for-service beneficiaries to the broader population of Medicare disability beneficiaries (MDBs),
adding NDI linkage. This will enhance power for variations and outcomes across minoritized populations and
communities, and provide access to mortality outcomes that is no longer possible through investigator-
managed physical-data linkage as originally planned, due to new CMS policy changes.
 Under this supplement, we will utilize 100% linked NDI-Medicare claims data in the VRDC to identify
evolving patterns of diagnostic and treatment history for fatal drug overdoses across racial-ethnic subgroups;
construct 100% cohorts of opioid overdose survivors; and analyze MOUD treatment trajectories and fatal
overdose risk in these expanded high-risk cohorts. This will greatly enhance resolving power for variations
across racial/ethnic subgroups, improve generalizability by including the managed care population; incorporate
more-recent years of data; and incorporate methadone treatment, added to Medicare in 2020. We will utilize
the linked data to assess evolving patterns of fatal drug overdoses across racial/ethnic subgroups and
communities; create 100% cohorts of MDBs treated for non-fatal overdose, anchored on overdose date as
index date; implement event history analyses of MOUD treatment and overdose fatality risk in these cohorts;
assess the role of components of treatment disparities on outcome disparities including risk of fatal overdose;
and identify the most promising targets in the treatment cascade for intervention to reduce outcome disparities."

MD, Institute for Health Policy at Duke University (Duke-Margolis) proposes to continue engaging with teams at
FDA/CDER to jointly tackle a range of priority public health issues, leveraging our access to a wide variety of
experts within the Duke ecosystem and our strong relationships with a diverse range of external stakeholders to
advance aims in the following areas:
Specific Aim 1: Execute collaborative research projects with FDA to support the Agency and its stakeholders by
exploring and addressing a range of critical and pressing public health topics related to FDA's oversight of
medical products, policy, and surveillance methods and systems. Our approach incorporates a wide array of
stakeholder perspectives, including those from emerging areas and/or new to engaging with FDA, to explore key
topic areas through impactful convenings, facilitate the identification of practical and actionable solutions, support
the Agency in its essential public health activities, and bring benefits to patients.
Specific Aim 2: Synthesize and distill the research, stakeholder input, and event discussions in Aim 1 to identify
concrete, actionable next steps and recommendations for all stakeholder groups, including FDA, to pursue. In
achieving this aim, we will develop a range of audience-tailored deliverables that lay out avenues for progress.
Specific Aim 3: Disseminate the findings and recommendations developed under Aim 2 to key stakeholders and
the public in a transparent manner, promoting trust and driving policy advancement in priority areas. Convening
and research materials will be posted publicly on Duke-Margolis event webpages as appropriate and findings
shared through those and other venues selected to reach broad audiences and drive progress."

Maternal immune activation (MIA) during prenatal or postnatal development significantly increases the risk for
offspring neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) later in life. Growing evidence suggest that regardless of the
MIA stimuli (infectious or environmental), offspring exhibit an enhanced risk for lifelong neuropathology defects
ranging from reduced brain volume to alterations in neurocircuit organization. The brain extracellular matrix-
containing chondroitin and dermatan sulfate-glycosaminoglycans (CS/DS-GAGs) are key regulators of brain
development and can be biochemically altered by neuroimmune responses. Defects in CS/DS-GAG abundance
and/or sulfation patterning (4S (CS-A), 2S4S (CS-B/DS), 6S (CS-C), 2S6S (CS-D), 4S6S (CS-E), 0S (CS-O))
result in the manifestation of similar neuropsychiatric behaviors as reported in offspring affected by MIA, but
whether and how MIA affects offspring brain matrix is unknown. By employing a novel laser capture
microdissection coupled mass spectrometry methodology (LMD-LC-MS/MS), our Preliminary Data provide the
first evidence for inter- and intra-regional differences in CS/DS-GAG sulfation pattern differences throughout the
developing mouse and non-human primate (NHP) brain. Specifically, the hippocampus exhibits a significant
increase in both developmental 6S (CS-C) and 2S6S (CS-D) isomers compared to the cortex, implying that the
hippocampus remains developmentally plastic long after the maturation of adjacent regions. Moreover, we show
that infectious Zika virus MIA during gestation in NHPs decreases the abundance of the developmental 2S6S
(CS-D) axonal growth factor attractant isomer in the hippocampus, suggesting stunted neurocircuit formation
after infectious MIA, while the non-infectious maternal high fat diet (mHFD) MIA during lactation in mice
decreases the abundance of the developmental 6S (CS-C) plasticity isomer in the hippocampus, suggested
accelerated early maturation of hippocampal neurocircuits in response to non-infectious MIA. The implication
that both infectious and non-infectious MIA insults influence the spatiotemporal regulation of brain CS/DS-GAG
sulfation patterns fits a global interconnecting theory linking a range of MIA insults with changes in offspring brain
neurodevelopment through re-coding of CS/DS-GAGs. From these results, we propose to 1) determine how MIA
exposure affects spatiotemporal expression of offspring CS/DS-GAGs and link these changes to NDDs later in
life, 2) mechanistically investigate how these MIA-induced changes in offspring CS/DS-GAGs influence glycan-
protein interactions involved in neurodevelopment, and 3) engineer a state-of-the-art nanopore sequencing
technology capable of single-molecule sequencing of biological CS/DS-GAGs to discover glycan-protein binding
elements. This multidisciplinary proposal has important translational potential to clarify how MIA exposure leads
to neuropsychiatric illness through changes in CS/DS-GAG sulfation patterning during childhood
neurodevelopment and provides valuable targets in the prevention and treatment of mental health diseases."

This is an application for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K01). The goal of
the proposed project is to provide the candidate with advanced skills necessary to develop an independent
research program focused on the association between physical activity and cognitive decline and dementia,
particularly as it pertains to Alzheimer disease-related dementias (ADRDs). To facilitate this long-term career
goal the candidate will: focus on two physical activity-related measures of energy expenditure (“energetics”) (1)
cardiorespiratory fitness and (2) the energetic cost of walking, as objective markers of the physiological
consequences of habitual physical activity. Recent published work by the candidate suggests that measures of
energetics may optimally capture the physiological mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of physical
activity on risk for cognitive decline. This research indicates that lower levels of cardiorespiratory fitness –the
integrated ability to deliver oxygen to the musculoskeletal system during sustained activity– is associated with
cognitive decline, increased rate of brain atrophy, and decreased resting cerebral blood flow and that a higher
energetic cost of walking –the oxygen needed for customary paced walking– is associated with increased odds
of amyloid positivity and accelerated hippocampal and brain atrophy. This application proposes a longitudinal
study to i) investigate the extent to which changes in energetics track with changes in cognition and AD
biomarkers, ii) assess which modifiable energetic measure may hold the greatest predictive value with respect
to the forgoing outcomes; and iii) investigate mitochondrial function as a potential underlying biological
mechanism of energetics-brain associations. With a transdisciplinary mentorship team, the applicants career
development plan builds on his previous research training to gain proficiency in: 1) advanced neuroimaging
techniques, using PET and MRS, 2) physical activity-related measures of energy expenditure and post-exercise
MRS assessment of oxidative capacity (a correlate of mitochondrial function), 3) cognitive changes associated
with aging and ADRD, 4) longitudinal statistical analysis, 5) professional development, and 6) responsible
conduct of research. The research objectives and training goals of this K01 award will provide a learning
environment to advance the applicants knowledge in cognitive aging and ADRD and facilitate his transition to an
independent investigator examining the impact of modifiable lifestyle activities on cognitive decline in older
persons."
11118112,"Project Summary
The ability to establish and maintain subcellular organization is a fundamental design principle of biological
systems. We recently discovered that many jumbo phage establish surprisingly complex subcellular organization
involving a nucleus-like structure or “phage nucleus” that compartmentalizes phage replication within the host
cytoplasm. The phage nucleus carries out many functions previously only attributed to the eukaryotic nucleus
including segregation of key processes (DNA replication and repair, mRNA synthesis, protein synthesis and
metabolism) and selective protein import and mRNA export. However, the phage nucleus is structurally dissimilar
to the eukaryotic nucleus, being mainly composed of a single layer of a phage-encoded protein and lacking
evident openings for exchange with the cytoplasm instead of a double-layer lipid membrane containing prominent
pore complexes. We have identified the key protein that makes up the phage nucleus shell; however, the
components required to assemble a fully functional phage nucleus and their roles in this multipurpose structure
remain unknown. Here we aim to identify and characterize additional proteins that are required to construct a
fully functional phage nucleus to gain greater insight into the biology of these understudied viruses and the
underlying principles of subcellular compartmentalization previously observed almost exclusively in eukaryotes.
We will use an integrative approach that combines genetics, cell biology, biochemistry and in situ and in vitro
structural biology approaches to study the jumbo phage in Pseudomonas and E. coli. Together, the knowledge
gained from this project will provide insight into fundamental principles underlying subcellular organization."
11117441,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The ultimate goal of this project is to create synthetic genetic circuits that accurately control the level of cell fate-
specific transcription factors (TFs) autonomously in response to cell state changes. The underlying hypothesis is that
the level and timing of expression of critical TFs dictates the efficiency of cell conversion protocols and the quality of
produced cells. Here, we focus on the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into hemogenic
endothelial cells (HECs) from which all hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSC/HPCs) arise. Unfortunately, cur-
rent methods to derive definite HECs (dHECs), which have the potential to produce adult-type lymphoid cells and HSCs,
remain not only inefficient but are also difficult to execute and scale, and, as a consequence, exhibit high degrees of
variability in outcomes between different labs, hiPSC lines, and even between replicate experiments.These problems
hamper analysis of the underlying developmental processes and pose formidable obstacles to clinical translation of
hiPSC-derived blood cell products since ensuring the safety and cost-effectiveness of the product necessitates high
differentiation efficiency and consistency. Prior work has demonstrated that SCL (S), LMO2 (L), GATA2 (G), and ETV2
(E) TFs together are sufficient to convert hiPSCs-derived mesoderm to dHECs and that efficient forward programming
requires discovery and subsequent implementation of both optimal expression levels and timing for each TF. Yet, con-
ventional methods for TF-mediated cell fate programming rely on indiscriminate overexpression without any control on
cellular TF levels. This is largely due to our inability to precisely control TF levels at user-defined values during cell
fate programming, and this limitation has prevented discovering optimal trajectories and subsequently enforcing them.
Here, we propose synthetic genetic controller circuits that overcome this hurdle. Specifically, in Aim 1, we create ge-
netic circuit designs that set TF levels and use them in an efficient in vitro differentiation protocol to discover the optimal
combination of S, L, G, E levels and timing. In Aim 2, we develop a new circuit architecture, based on TET1-enabled
positive feedback, to prevent epigenetic silencing of our genetic circuits once we deliver them to hiPSCs. In Aim 3,
we make our genetic controller circuits enforce autonomously the optimal SLGE TF levels found in Aim 1 in response
to the hiPSC-to-mesoderm transition. We achieve this by a new autocatalytic ADAR-based RNA sense-and-respond
system, which senses the mesoderm marker Brachyury (TBXT) and enforces user-defined TF levels in response to
it. We expect that this process, by being autonomous as opposed to manual and by enforcing optimal TF trajectories,
will result in a more efficient, repeatable, and robust hiPSCs to dHECs conversion protocol, thereby helping fill the
gap to clinical translation. Although in this project we tailor the genetic circuit designs to controlling SLGE TFs after
sensing mesoderm-specific transcripts, the designs can be readily modified to express different TFs in response to
any other cell type- or state-specific transcript. Therefore, we believe that the synthetic biology technology that we will
establish will have broad impact on any other cell fate programming as well as any cell-or gene-therapy projects where
expression levels and timing, as well as resistance to silencing, are important."

This IDDRC administrative supplemental application builds on a successful collaboration of the Intellectual and
Developmental Disabilities Research Centers (IDDRCs), in which investigators at 12 centers implemented the
NIH-funded Brain Gene Registry (BGR) to understand the impact of rare variants in intellectual and
developmental disabilities (IDD) genes. As a multisite network-wide collaborative project, the BGR promotes
translational research spanning the nearly 3,000 purported IDD genes by uniquely linking genotypic and
phenotypic data, remotely capturing rapid neurobehavioral assessment (RNAP) data, and collecting correlative
electronic health record (EHR) data. To accelerate the translational advances arising from this unique cross-
IDDRC resource, we propose to use this IDDRC administrative supplement to sustain the growth of the BGR
both in terms of participant accrual and data usage. In Aim 1, we will collect participant data through
collaborations with GenomeConnect, individual sites for EHR data, and centralized administration of the remote
behavioral assessment protocol (RNAP) using our CIELO platform BGR database. To encourage recruitment
and reduce participant burden, we will assess strengths and redundancies in multimodal data collection. We will
validate the remote neurobehavioral assessment protocol (RNAP) with traditional in-person assessment and
explore the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based methods to extract meaningful information from the EHR to
reduce the high burden on participants and improve data completeness. In Aim 2 we will resolve IDD gene and
variant pathogenicity through partnerships with ClinGen by leveraging the paired genotypic and phenotypic BGR
data to curate and reclassify variants under the ClinGen Gene and Variant Curation Expert Panel framework. In
Aim 3, we will develop strategies to facilitate use of BGR by investigators and patient advocacy groups (PAGs)
by simplifying data access and disseminating information to participants and researchers. These initiatives build
capacity and access to a shared IDD resource by investigators within and beyond the IDDRC network, as well
as patient advocacy groups."
11110075,"Project Summary
Privacy and security of personal information has become one of the major grand challenges in modern society,
especially for healthcare studies. Re-identification risks and data breaches require new policies and regulations
for data sharing across healthcare institutions and research laboratories. While policy cannot solve the problem
on its own, advanced technologies that work hand in hand with policy are important to address the
privacy/security concerns. Predictive analytics can support quality improvement, clinical research, and eventually
impact patient health status. Extensive clinical variable information and voluminous data records from multiple
institutions and laboratories are necessary to further improve the performance of modeling approaches and to
identify medication-outcome associations for diseases. Nonetheless, the transfer of such sensitive data among
institutions/laboratories can present serious privacy risks, which can jeopardize NIH’s mission. Aiming at
mitigating the privacy problem while increasing predictive capability via cross-institutional modeling, prior studies
proposed distributed methods to exchange only the predictive models, but not patient data. However, these
methods still pose many challenges to the clinical cross-institutional learning problem, including the need for
more comprehensive clinical variables and more patient records to achieve better prediction discrimination and
build more generalizable models, the necessity for discovery/alleviation of data manipulation to increase the
trustworthiness of the collaboratively trained models, and the requirement for more validation to ensure usability.
In this proposal, we plan to develop SOCAL (Privacy-protecting Sharing Of Clinical data Across Laboratories), a
distributed framework addressing these challenges by integrating vertical/horizontal modeling methods to
include both more complete variables and more records, discovering/alleviating data manipulation incidents
using models recorded on blockchain, and conducting controlled experiments and designing/testing a web portal
with physician-researchers to increase the usability of the system. SOCAL will be evaluated on a Coronavirus
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) dataset from five University of California (UC) Health medical centers. We expect the
knowledge/capability of collaborative modeling can be improved, the trustworthiness of the learning process can
be enhanced, and the framework will be ready for use. SOCAL is innovative because it will be a new integration
methodology for vertical/horizontal modeling, a novel data manipulation resisting methods, and a hardened
prototype for a practical blockchain application. We anticipate a powerful impact of the SOCAL framework to
largely reduce the privacy concerns of predictive modeling tasks for various stakeholders, including healthcare
providers, clinical researchers, and patients. Upon completion, SOCAL can accelerate the development of
methods/technologies to increase willingness of institutions to participate in such a collaboration for improving
the effectiveness of healthcare."

successful GloCal Health Fellowship (GloCal). Our LMIC sites are well-established, work in regions with some
of the highest burden of disease, and stand to benefit from our program’s capacity building, mentorship training
and alumni support. GloCal is the only UC-wide global health training program, and our track record shows that
we: 1) Recruit pre- and postdoctoral trainees diverse in discipline and race [39% of U.S. trainees over the past
5 years identify as an underrepresented minority (URM)] who aspire to build interdisciplinary academic
research careers in global health; 2) Provide outstanding, interdisciplinary education and training in global
health in collaboration with faculty mentors from participating UC campuses and collaborating LMIC
institutions; and 3) Provide each trainee with a rich and enduring mentored research experience that fosters
scientific and career development in global health. The program also advances long-term objectives to 1)
Develop models of interdisciplinary, innovative global health research and training designed to ensure healthy
lives and promote well-being for all; 2) Enhance global health networks between the UC and our LMIC partners
and recruit faculty leading innovative global health research; and 3) Strengthen a sustainable and equitable
model of collaboration between the UC and our LMIC partners that develops research capacity that advances
locally-led and locally-relevant research. GloCal will recruit candidates from a pipeline of 65 T32 and 13 D43
programs. GloCal trainees are at different career stages, but all receive: 1) A 9 or 12-month, hands-on
research experience onsite with one of our LMIC partners—LMIC fellows will spend their first 2 to 3 months of
the program at UC and earn a certificate in ‘conducting global health research’; 2) A strong, interdisciplinary
mentored research experience; 3) Instruction in global health through onsite and online courses; and 4) Career
development to ensure that they attain their short-term goals and succeed in transitioning to the next career
stage. GloCal leadership and standing committees ensure that these program components form a seamless,

11102302,"Project Summary
Maintaining epithelial homeostasis is crucial for organismal health since its disruption is linked to multiple
human diseases, such as cancers. Cells elicit many behaviors to maintain the structure and function of
epithelia during normal homeostasis and stress. Comprehending their behavior is essential for promoting our
knowledge of how to keep epithelia healthy. We propose to take advantage of the robustness of the Drosophila
intestinal system to gain new insights into complex cell behaviors that remain understudied. Our R35-funded
research concerns ‘cell extrusion’, a process that removes unnecessary, defective, or potentially harmful cells
from epithelia without disrupting its barrier function. Over the past five years, we established the Drosophila
intestine as a new model for studying how intestinal epithelial cells expressing an oncogenic Ras (RasV12) are
eliminated apically and basally from the intestinal epithelium. We have identified multiple new players in the
process and provided new concepts to the field. Moreover, our study resulted in two new observations: 1)
Drosophila macrophage-like immune cells hemocytes infiltrate into the intestinal epithelium and elicit complex
cell behaviors under stress, and 2) intestinal epithelial cells generate long-range projections, resembling
‘airinimes’—structures that mediate long-distance signaling during pigment development in zebrafish. These
cell behaviors are documented in multiple model systems; however, their physiological significance and
underlying molecular mechanisms require additional investigation. Our observations bring an exciting
opportunity to leverage the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila to understand the roles of these cell
behaviors in a native context and identify new players in these processes. Thus, we propose to expand our
research scope to include these additional complex cell behaviors. Continuing our work on cell extrusion, we
will focus on addressing what drives the elimination of RasV12-expressing intestinal epithelial cells from the
intestine. Regarding the behavior of hemocytes, we propose to investigate how hemocyte-mediated cell
behaviors contribute to the maintenance of the intestinal epithelium structure and function during normal
homeostasis and under stress. Lastly, we will study what signaling is mediated by the long-range projections
and what roles they play in the maintenance of intestinal epithelium. The overarching goal is to increase our
general understanding of complex cell behaviors underlying epithelial homeostasis by elucidating their
biological significance and discovering their molecular mechanisms. These proposed studies will help us to
learn the principles that keep epithelia healthy and prevent diseases associated with abnormalities in epithelial
homeostasis."
11115348,"In cystic fibrosis (CF), mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) unleash a
cascade of clinical disorders, including chronic airway infections, systemic inflammation, microbial virulence,
diabetes, malnutrition and liver disease. Great progress has been made in some areas of disease, and CFTR
modulators provide dramatic benefits to some patients. Still, there is growing evidence of the interconnections
among lung and gut dysbiosis and CF pathogenesis. As patients live longer, formerly rare symptoms are
becoming more common. Thus, there is a pressing need to both understand and systematically treat the
functional relationships between CFTR function, commensal and pathogenic microbes, metabolic states, and
innate and acquired immune responses. Dartmouth has an interactive CF research team of 49 faculty members
with extramural funding of $11.1M/year, studying epithelial biology, CFTR correction, host-microbe interactions,
gut dysbiosis and immunity, as well as airway infections and antimicrobial strategies. The Dartmouth CF
Research Center (DartCF) will build on progress made in the past year. We will deploy P30 and institutional
funds to recruit new CF faculty, strengthen our research base, and foster interdisciplinary discovery. Our aims
are: 1) to catalyze new research in CF basic and translational research in areas of interest to NIDDK; 2) to
develop integrative strategies to understand and address CF pathobiology; 3) to create new research tools and
support CF research through outstanding shared services; and 4) to build research capacity in CF locally,
regionally, and nationally. We will focus P30 resources on 1) pioneering transparency and interoperability for CF
datasets, 2) forging collaborations between CF and data-science researchers to mine these datasets for
systems-level perspectives and 3) building on unique Dartmouth longitudinal patient cohorts to explore microbial
community structure in the gut, host-microbe signaling, the effects of existing therapies, and implications for
whole-body disease. A key theme is that dysbioses are interconnected, and that parallel investigations, coupled
by powerful new data-science strategies can understand this complex underlying biology and reveal new
therapeutic approaches. In parallel, we will leverage our research base to support early-stage preclinical target
development. DartCF supports a variety of mechanisms. First, we fund a Pilot Project Project (P3) to develop
new scientific opportunities in NIDDK-revelant areas and to recruit new faculty members to the Center. Second,
we fund three scientific cores to support studies in CF: a Gastrointestinal Biology Core (GIBC), a Clinical and
Translational Research Core (CTRC), and a CF Bioinformatics & Biostatistics Core (CF-BBC). Finally, we
support an Enrichment and Research Administration Core (ERAC) to foster an interactive scientific community,
sponsor retreats and courses, and track program progress. These efforts will identify new CF therapeutic
opportunities, develop novel interventions, monitor the resulting changes body-wide, and track outcomes.
DartCF will intensify the translation of research into improved CF outcomes at Dartmouth."
11108999,"Despite aggressive use of combination antiretroviral therapy, HIV infection is associated with cognitive and
neurobehavioral impairment, collectively termed neuroHIV. HIV and opiates are independently associated with
blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, alterations in inflammatory signaling, and cognitive and motor deficits.
The HIV viral protein Tat is thought to mediate much of the HIV-associated damage within the brain. This
proposal will use both a Tat transgenic mouse model and a murine tropic HIV-infected mouse model. The Tat
transgenic mouse model expresses HIV-1 Tat driven by a GFAP promotor, which limits expression to the CNS.
The two models will be used to examine the effects of HIV and morphine in vivo. Our central hypothesis is that
opiates compromise BBB function and contribute to neuropathology through complex mechanisms which
include enhancing paracellular flux, while paradoxically decreasing net flux of antiretrovirals across the barrier,
increasing infiltration of monocytes, and increasing inflammatory signals within the brain. We will address our
hypotheses with the following specific aims. Aim 1. Define the effects of opiates ± HIV-1 Tat and HIV infection
on BBB integrity and function and on region-specific impact on antiretrovirals and morphine concentrations
within the brain. Aim 2. Characterize regional differences in the interplay between opiates ± HIV/HIV-1 Tat and
ARVs on macrophage infiltration into the CNS and on proinflammatory cytokine production the CNS. These
studies will define and relate the effects of opiates and/or HIV-1 on regional drug accumulation, BBB integrity,
drug metabolism/efflux, and immune cell trafficking into and inflammatory signals within the brain. Better
understanding of this dynamic interplay, with specific focus on antiretroviral brain concentrations, will improve
the current therapeutic approaches for the HIV patients who use opioids (for licit or illicit use).
The long-term goal is to understand how opiates limit ARV therapeutic efficacy within the brain in the setting of
HIV and to identify targets for therapeutic development to eliminate the negative effects of opiates/HIV on
neurocognitive outcomes."

successful GloCal Health Fellowship (GloCal). Our LMIC sites are well-established, work in regions with some
of the highest burden of disease, and stand to benefit from our program’s capacity building, mentorship training
and alumni support. GloCal is the only UC-wide global health training program, and our track record shows that
we: 1) Recruit pre- and postdoctoral trainees diverse in discipline and race [39% of U.S. trainees over the past
5 years identify as an underrepresented minority (URM)] who aspire to build interdisciplinary academic
research careers in global health; 2) Provide outstanding, interdisciplinary education and training in global
health in collaboration with faculty mentors from participating UC campuses and collaborating LMIC
institutions; and 3) Provide each trainee with a rich and enduring mentored research experience that fosters
scientific and career development in global health. The program also advances long-term objectives to 1)
Develop models of interdisciplinary, innovative global health research and training designed to ensure healthy
lives and promote well-being for all; 2) Enhance global health networks between the UC and our LMIC partners
and recruit faculty leading innovative global health research; and 3) Strengthen a sustainable and equitable
model of collaboration between the UC and our LMIC partners that develops research capacity that advances
locally-led and locally-relevant research. GloCal will recruit candidates from a pipeline of 65 T32 and 13 D43
programs. GloCal trainees are at different career stages, but all receive: 1) A 9 or 12-month, hands-on
research experience onsite with one of our LMIC partners—LMIC fellows will spend their first 2 to 3 months of
the program at UC and earn a certificate in ‘conducting global health research’; 2) A strong, interdisciplinary
mentored research experience; 3) Instruction in global health through onsite and online courses; and 4) Career
development to ensure that they attain their short-term goals and succeed in transitioning to the next career
stage. GloCal leadership and standing committees ensure that these program components form a seamless,
integrated experience supported by evaluation and continuous improvement. Strengths and innovations of the
program include: 1) A unified consortium under UCGHI that includes four UCs at the leading edge of global

11115484,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Long-term memory impairment significantly impacts patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but no targeted
treatment exists. There is a critical need to understand the mechanisms that disrupt long-term information stor-
age in the epileptic brain. The long-term goal is to develop strategies to ameliorate and prevent cognitive impair-
ment in patients with epilepsy. The overall objectives are to i) elucidate how interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs)
affect hippocampal-cortical communication during memory consolidation, and ii) determine how closed-loop
modulation of this communication alters long-term memory in an animal model of TLE. The central hypothesis
is that IEDs disrupt the interaction of hippocampal ripples and cortical sleep spindles, altering neural activity
patterns and plasticity. Further, restoration of physiologic hippocampal-cortical coupling can normalize the long-
term memory deficits observed in TLE. The rationale for this project is that elucidating the spatiotemporally spe-
cific network mechanisms that underlie long-term memory disruption will enable prevention of pathologic com-
munication without impairment of physiologic communication, thereby facilitating memory consolidation. The
central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims in a TLE animal model: i) evaluate the effect of
modulating hippocampal-cortical oscillatory coupling on neural spiking patterns; ii) determine the effect of mod-
ulating hippocampal-cortical coupling on long-term memory, iii) establish links between large-scale molecular
markers of synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-cortical oscillatory coupling during impaired memory consolida-
tion. To accomplish these aims, in vivo electrophysiology and assays of immediate early gene expression will
be paired with closed-loop electrical stimulation in freely behaving rats performing long-term memory tasks. The
research proposed is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion, because it focuses on modulating neuronal commu-
nication between brain regions during the interictal period to enhance memory consolidation. These contributions
will be significant because they are expected to provide the mechanistic groundwork for development of novel
approaches to treat, and potentially prevent, memory impairment in patients with epilepsy."
11113151,"Project Summary/Abstract
Studying the anti-HIV mechanisms of restriction factors is central to understanding virus-host
interaction and for developing novel therapeutics. Recently, PI Wu's lab has co-identified a new
HIV restriction factor, PSGL-1 (P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1), that inactivates the infectivity
of HIV virions released from HIV producing cells. Wu and his collaborators have further
demonstrated that PSGL-1 acts through a novel mechanism of virion incorporation of PSGL-1
that sterically hinders particle attachment to target cells. PSGL-1 is a dimeric mucin-like 120-KD
glycoprotein that is primarily expressed on the surface of lymphoid and myeloid cells, and
binds to P-, L-, and E-selectins for leukocyte rolling and transmigration. Structurally, PSGL-1
has a relatively rigid and elongated extracellular domain that extends nearly 60 nm from cell
surface. A large structural part of the extracellular domain also consists of 14-16 tandem
decameric repeats (DR), which are characterized by repeated stretches of 10 amino acids with
numerous O-glycosylated threonines (30%) and prolines (10%). Our preliminary studies
discovered that DR plays a pivotal role in PSGL-1's anti-HIV activity, and a single DR possesses
basic anti-viral activity. Nevertheless, individual DR shows amino acid sequence variation and
varying degrees of anti-viral activity. We hypothesize that the structural rigidity and
glycosylation of DR affect its anti-HIV activity. The proposed research integrates molecular
dynamics simulations, machine learning, and laboratory experiments to study the anti-HIV
properties of DR. The proposal has two aims. Aim 1 is to determine the structure-function
relationship of DR via the integration of In silico molecular modeling, DNA mutagenesis, and
functional anti-HIV assays. We will apply all-atom replica exchange with solute tempering
(REST) molecular dynamics simulations to examine DR glycosylation, rigidity, and extension.
We will also apply machine learning to feature datasets extracted from molecular simulation of
DR variants. We expect that the integration of our studies from molecular modeling, DR
mutagenesis, and functional anti-HIV assays will guide the design of novel PSGL-1 variants
with greater anti-HIV activity. Aim 2 is to test and validate the anti-HIV activity of PSGL-1 in
vivo in a humanized mouse model for control of HIV replication in the absence of ART. The
proposed work will identify how DR residue positioning and composition quantitatively
correlate with PSGL-1's anti-HIV function. Our study will also help developing novel
therapeutics, based on PSGL-1's anti-HIV activity, for a functional cure of HIV infection."
11105703,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Since establishing a multi-state Technical Working Group in 2013, the National
Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) has been working with the
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), states, and territories to implement
the Produce Safety Rule (21 CFR Part 112) as authorized under the Food Safety
Modernization Act (FSMA). In response to RFA-FD-24-012, NASDA will continue
building on the achievements under previous cooperative agreements to meet emerging
needs identified by FDA, states, and territories.
The NASDA project entitled A Coordinated National Approach to Supporting, Promoting, and
Implementing FDA's Produce Safety Rule and the Produce Regulatory Program Standards will
continue building on three important objectives:
  Objective 1: Supporting the efforts of federal, state, and territorial government agencies
 in building a Produce Safety Integrated Food Safety System.
  Objective 2: Supporting and expanding established systems for sharing, promoting,
 and collaborating on best practices, operating documents, procedures, and other tools to
 foster a consistent national produce safety program.
  Objective 3: Supporting the maintenance and advancement of the Produce Regulatory
 Program Standards (PRPS).
These three objectives will support FDA's goal of developing, implementing, and improving a
nationally consistent support system which facilitates the implementation of state and territorial
produce safety regulatory programs that are modernized and aligned with the standards set
forth in the FDA's rule: Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing, and Holding of
Produce for Human Consumption (commonly referred to as the Produce Safety Rule).
The proposed collaborative assistance offered to state and territorial produce safety regulatory
programs will improve their effectiveness and enhance their capabilities. Other expected
outcomes include promotion of a broad understanding of the Produce Safety Rule, greater levels
of industry compliance with the Produce Safety Rule's requirements, and ultimately better
protection for consumers from foodborne illness."

The Sustainable Development for HIV Health (SD4H) Training Program, a collaboration between Maseno
University, the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and the University of California Global Health
Institute (UCGHI), supports the training of doctoral and master’s students interested in transdisciplinary
HIV research. Since starting the program four years ago, we have found it challenging to recruit trainees
from the School of Medicine; only one of our master’s students is from the SOM, while the four doctoral,
two post-doctoral, and three of our four master’s students are from the School of Public Health &
Community Development (SPHCD) (the DEI supplement supports a single student in the School of
Agriculture & Food Security). Through this supplement, we will recruit post-graduate Master of Medicine
(MMED) students (i.e., medical residents) from the SOM, as well as PhD students from the SPHCD with
an interest in research on women and HIV across the lifespan. This program will include the following
components: 1) a three-month “Designing Clinical Research” hybrid course (most sessions in-person with
some virtual sessions); 2) the development of a research concept that will serve as the trainees’ thesis for
their PhD or MMED program; 3) funding for up to three proposals; 4) mentorship from scientists from
Maseno University, KEMRI and UCGHI; and 5) a bi-weekly research seminar and final research
symposium at the conclusion of the program. Western Kenya, the location of SD4H, hosts many research
projects that are focused on women and HIV across the lifespan. Some examples include: i) testing a
multisectoral agriculture intervention to decrease adverse pregnancy outcomes among women living with
HIV, ii) cervical cancer prevention among women living with HIV, iii) development of a scale to measure
stigma among widows living with HIV, iv) testing a multisectoral agricultural intervention at secondary
schools to reduce risk factors that can lead to HIV acquisition among adolescent girls and v) use of a “soft
cup” for menstrual hygiene to reduce adolescent girls risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infection
acquisition. Trainees will meet with investigators who can serve as mentors, and avail resources that
trainees can leverage to conduct their research. This supplement will help to train the next generation of
clinician- and non-clinician researchers at the intersection of women and HIV at Maseno University."

the annual workshop for the 11 centers and scientific advisory group (SAG) meeting for
Ethiopia and Uganda ICEMRs in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We will manage the scientific
program of the workshop, and facilitate the travel logistics of participants from all 11
ICEMR centers. The 5-day workshop and SAG meeting will include presentations by
individual ICEMRs on their scientific progress, information sessions on the ICEMR
program specific requirement, discussion sessions on common issues of interest and
break-out sessions on specific important scientific questions in malaria research and
control. The workshop will enable participants to share their latest discoveries, expertise,

11028257,"Nerve injury (i.e. neuropathic) pain is not well characterized within the Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) population; a recent pilot study to improve pain phenotyping in oral cancer patients found that the majority of patients report at least one neuropathic pain descriptor, such as “burning” or “pins and needles”. In the presence of nerve injury and neuropathic pain, it has been demonstrated that adrenergic plasticity, as well as sympathetic sprouting, occur, leading to sympathetic-sensory coupled pain. We have previously demonstrated that aggressive tongue tumor growth drives nerve injury in tongue-innervating trigeminal ganglia neurons (TGNs) as well as tongue-innervating sympathetic postganglionic neurons in the superior cervical ganglia (SCG). Additionally, in pursuit of the parent grant Specific Aim 2, using single-cell PCR, we found an increase in alpha1-adrenergic receptor gene expression in tongue-innervating TGNs from tumor-bearing mice compared to sham. Furthermore, preliminary data collection by the candidate showed adrenergic sensitivity in tongue-innervating TGNs using Ca2+ imaging; norepinephrine (NE, 10μM) evoked a Ca2+ transient in the majority of tumor mice compared to sham; this NE-evoked response in neurons from tumor-bearing mice was blocked by alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, doxazosin mesylate. While the tumor is still present and cancer-induced nociception is not dependent on sympathetic signaling in its entirety, these data suggest a prominent role for sympathetic neurotransmission in oral cancer pain. The hypothesis for this proposal is that nerve injury secondary to oral cancer dysregulates adrenergic signaling in tongue-innervating nociceptive neurons exacerbating cancer pain. To test this hypothesis using preclinical mouse models, we will determine whether cancer-induced mandibular nerve injury is necessary for the development of adrenergic sensitivity as well as determine whether mandibular nerve injury alone is sufficient for the development of adrenergic sensitivity in the presence of oral cancer, using single-cell PCR, microfluorimetry/electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. We will also assess the contribution of adrenergic sensitivity in trigeminal afferents to spontaneous orofacial pain behavior (Grimace, and grooming), and leverage adrenergic pharmacology to augment or reduce nociceptive behaviors induced by a model of oral cancer or trigeminal nerve injury."
11118291,"Project Summary
 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a growing sleep-related breathing disorder with the prevalence rate of
10-15% in the middle-age adults and of 32%-62% in elderly. OSA patients undergo recurrent upper airway
collapse due to suppression of activity of upper airway dilator muscles during sleep, which causes repeated
hypoxia, frequent stressful arousals and sleep deprivation. OSA has a major health impact due to its
association with cardiovascular, metabolic and neurocognitive morbidities, including a risk factor for developing
Alzheimer’s disease and increased mortality in older adults.
 Brainstem noradrenergic (NA) system plays an important role in maintaining the tonus of upper airway
(UA) muscles to keep airway open during wakefulness. Therefore, the decrease of NA release during sleep
largely contributes to a loss of the UA muscle tone at night, which is a major neurological cause of OSA.
Studies suggest that aging has a detrimental effect on the NA system. However, there is little information
regarding age-related changes in the control of UA muscles by brainstem NA neurons, which may be a basis
of the increased prevalence of OSA in older population.
 In the proposed project, we will use a novel molecular-genetic approach that will allow a cell-type-specific
activation of NA neurons in the brainstem A1/C1, A5, A7 and SubCorelueus (SubC) nuclei while recording
activity of the genioglossus (GG), a major UA dilator muscle, during natural sleep and wakefulness in young (3-
4 months) and old (16-20 months) behaving DBH-Cre mice. We will determine the age-related changes in 1)
the ability of A1/C1, A5, A7 and SubC neurons to activate the GG muscle; 2) the contribution of A1/C1, A5, A7
and SubC neurons to depression of the GG muscle activity during NREM sleep and REM sleep; 3) the
number of NA neurons in these and other brainstem NA nuclei; and 4) the density of axons and their terminals
that originate from A1/C1, A5, A7 and SubC neurons and project to hypoglossal and other UA motoneurons.
 The proposed work will reveal neurological bases of the reduction in effectiveness of UA muscles to
maintain UA open during sleep in older individuals. The results of this study will fill a major gap in our
understanding of underlying mechanisms of OSA pathogenesis in elderly and lay the groundwork for
translational research of OSA pathology in aging to develop preventive and/or therapeutic strategies for clinical
management of OSA in older patients."

the likelihood of trainees becoming independent global health scientists and leaders. We have modified our
consortium name to reflect this new emphasis: Northern Pacific Global Health Leadership, Education, And
Development for Early-career Researchers (NPGH LEADERs). We propose to continue partnerships based in
nine countries: Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Cameroon, Liberia, Peru, Thailand, Nepal, and India. To achieve our
objective of developing the next generation of independent global health scientists and leaders, we will offer
12-month research and leadership training with the following specific aims: Aim 1: To ensure excellence in
scientific inquiry, trainees will complete a comprehensive curriculum in global health research, including how to
frame novel, relevant, and feasible scientific questions, prepare detailed scientific protocols, and plan for the
implementation of a mentored research project in a low- or middle-income country. Aim 2: To address the
challenges of research implementation in a low-resource setting, trainees will follow an explicit, expedited,
supported, and mentored progression from research planning to pragmatic implementation and process
management. Aim 3: To prepare trainees for careers as independent scientists and to excel in both leadership
and management, we will support trainees in development of individualized “road maps” to define the research,
management and leadership skills necessary for their transition into independent investigators. We will also
expand alumni support for alumni to further strengthen the scientific and leadership skills necessary for
transitioning to the next generation of independent global health scientists. The four U.S. universities, as well
as Indiana University - an associated partner since 2016 - have committed cost-sharing funds totaling
$565,000 to increase recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities and a second year of fellowship
for the most productive fellows. We anticipate supporting at least 10 trainees each year, for a total of 50
trainees over the five year grant period; 60% of trainees will be at the U.S. postdoctoral level and 40% will
implement HIV-related research projects."

 Reducing new HIV and STI infections among South African (SA) adolescent girls and young women
(AGYW) is global public health priority.1 SA has world's largest HIV epidemic,2, 3 and SA AGYW acquire
HIV at twice the rate of and seroconvert on average 5 – 7 years earlier than male peers.3 As new infections
continue to outpace access to and availability of PrEP and ART, primary prevention remains the most
viable strategy to stem new transmissions.1, 4, 5 SA efforts to prevent HIV transmission in youth focus mostly
on individual-level behavior change,6-8 but AGYW’s persistent HIV disparities are explained by broad social
and structural inequities that shape and constrain HIV-risk behaviors.9-14 Comprehensive HIV prevention
packages that are integrated, synergistic, and tailored to the local epidemiology and cultural context are
likely to achieve and sustain maximum reductions in HIV-risk.15-22 Female caregivers (FC) are an untapped
resource in the HIV prevention toolbox23, 24 and offer a novel opportunity to strengthen AGYW prevention
efforts. AGYW may also be change agents for their FC who want to be positive role models for AGYW, and
thus, adopt HIV prevention behaviors, including HTC and PrEP. Guided by an ecological framework, our
highly experienced multidisciplinary team will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of IMARA-
SA, a multilevel, innovative, family-based HIV prevention program that targets individual, social, and
structural drivers of risk to decrease HIV and STI incident infections, reduce risky sexual behavior, and
increase HTC and PrEP uptake (where appropriate) in AGYW and FC. IMARA previously demonstrated a
43% reduction in incident STI at 12-month follow-up among Black 14-18 year-old girls in the US,25 and the
curriculum was carefully and systematically adapted to the South African context (IMARA-SA).26, 27 This
study will be integrated into the adolescent-friendly services at DTHF in the Western Cape metropolitan
area facilitating sustainability if effective. We will conduct a 2-arm RCT with 645 15-19 year-old AGYW and
FC comparing IMARA-SA to a time-matched family-based health promotion program (HP). FC and AGYW
will complete baseline, 6-, and 12-month assessments, including testing for three STIs. We will offer HTC
and PrEP at each assessment and track uptake and linkage to care. AGYW and FC who test positive for
a STI and/or HIV will receive free treatment at DTHF. We will collect data to determine the costs of IMARA-
SA. Analyses will compare AGYW and FC across the intervention and control programs on sexual risk
taking, STI and HIV incidence, PrEP and HTC uptake, and theoretical mediators. The study answers an
urgent need to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of combination HIV prevention packages
for AGYW to achieve an AIDS-free generation."

11110469,"The Center for Mental Healthcare & Outcomes Research (CeMHOR) is an HSR&D Center of Innovation whose
mission is to optimize health and well-being of Veterans through innovative research to improve access to and
engagement in evidence-based care for mental health and substance use disorders and prevent suicide.
CeMHOR Strategic Goals are to: 1) Advance knowledge and address gaps in access to and engagement in
evidence-based care for mental health and substance use disorders (Focus Area 1); 2) Develop, test, and
implement suicide prevention strategies (Focus Area 2); 3) Advance innovative research outside of focus
areas; 4) Strengthen strategic partnerships and collaborations with other centers and investigators to address
VA priorities; 5) Provide training, mentoring, and career development in mental health services research and
implementation science; and 6) Engage Veterans and other stakeholders in CeMHOR research. Key
CeMHOR, based at the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System, partners include the Office of Mental
Health and Suicide Prevention, the Primary Care-Mental Health Integration Initiative, the Office of Rural Health,
the VISN 16 Mental Health Product Line, the Behavioral Health QUERI, the South Central MIRECC, and the
University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. Dr. Richard Owen, a psychiatrist, has been the Director of
CeMHOR for 19 years; Dr. Teresa Hudson, a health services researcher and pharmacist, has been associate
director for 11 years. CeMHOR investigators possess a diverse background including psychiatrists,
psychologists, pharmacists, social workers, anthropologists, a demographer, a medical sociologist, and an
epidemiologist; their passion for improved care for Veterans unites them to investigate the most effective and
impactful methods of advancing health services research and implementing improved care for all Veterans.
CeMHOR has two primary focus areas: 1) improving access to and engagement in evidence-based care for
Veterans with mental health and substance use disorders; and 2) suicide prevention. These are top priorities
for VA, the Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, and HSR&D. Research outside these focus areas
includes: 1) research to decrease risks of opioid misuse/abuse and increase treatment of opioid use disorders;
and 2) additional implementation science research. All CeMHOR research is planned, designed, and
conducted with widespread implementation in mind. CeMHOR expertise in rural health and community
engagement and our location in a largely rural VISN also informs our work.
CeMHOR investigators have pioneered development, testing, and implementation of interventions to improve
access to and engagement mental health care, with an emphasis on improving access and care for rural
Veterans. Multiple studies demonstrated the effectiveness of virtual care management for mental disorders,
enabling rural Veterans to receive evidence-based mental health treatments in Community Based Outpatient
Clinics (CBOCs). These care models have been implemented widely in VA settings and translated by
CeMHOR investigators to Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), which also serve Veterans in rural
areas. CeMHOR investigators have also worked in community settings to improve access, forming
relationships with community clergy and other local leaders, community colleges, and counselors to increase
awareness of VA and community mental health prevention and treatment resources for Veterans. Suicide
prevention is a relatively new focus of CeMHOR research; nevertheless, CeMHOR investigators have
substantial expertise in this area, as well as strong relationships with operational partners and researchers at
other centers. Investigators are studying implementation of Caring Contacts, an evidence-based suicide
prevention strategy, and leading evaluation of two high-priority initiatives: implementation of REACH VET; a
national suicide prevention effort; and the peer support/community outreach pilot program mandated in the
Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans (SAV) Act."

In 2022, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was awarded a T32 competitive renewal grant,
responding to PA-20-142, to fund years 16-20 of the UNC Research Training Program in Complementary and
Integrative Healthcare (CIH). Our goal in this T32 Research Fellowship is to cultivate diverse, talented,
productive, well-trained, independent researchers at both the pre- and post-doctoral level as CIH research
leaders in investigating efficacy, effectiveness, mechanisms of action, and implementation of clinical integration
of complementary therapies and integrative health-care approaches. Our program highlights an
interdisciplinary array of research topics, methodologies and faculty mentors, providing rigorous training in
research methods to facilitate exploration of mind-body techniques and natural-product/nutritional therapies
and their applications in health promotion, chronic pain, metabolic syndrome, and other high-impact conditions,
with emphasis on enhancing access to CIH care in at-risk, underserved populations. The original proposed
Fellowship submission planned for five post-doctoral positions and two pre-doctoral positions; however, our
funded grant was reduced to five overall positions, with NIH/NCCIH providing the opportunity to apply for
supplemental funding for an exceptional individual who qualifies for the diversity supplement, to enhance NIH
goals for trainees from diverse backgrounds. This application, following NOT-AT-24-034, proposes the addition
of Victoria Yunez Behm, as a pre-doctoral fellow. Ms. Behm is a master’s trained Integrative Nutritionist who
continues to teach in the Nutrition and Herbal Medicine Program at the Maryland University of Integrative
Health. She is also a yoga teacher training instructor and recently completed a Master of Theological Studies
in Ethics at Duke University. Due to her deep commitment to extending multicomponent integrative health
interventions (including nutrition) to vulnerable communities, Ms. Behm is pursuing a PhD in nutrition under the
guidance of Dr. Alice Ammerman, a long-term mentor in the T32 program and a national leader in community-
engaged nutrition and lifestyle research. Her training will consist of T32 required courses (Responsible
Conduct of Research, Reproducibility and Rigor, Principles and Practices of Complementary and Alternative
Medicine, Mindfulness for Caring Professionals) and coursework within the Gillings School of Global Public
Health. In addition to coursework addressing her nutrition major, Ms. Behm plans to take courses designed to
develop her skills in qualitative research, quantitative methods, and community-engaged research. Her
mentoring team will include Dr. Ammerman and T-32 Directors Susan Gaylord and Dr. Keturah Faurot. Dr.
Gaylord will involve Ms. Behm in mind-body studies for underserved populations and Dr. Faurot will work with
Ms. Behm on designing nutrition interventions. Ms Behm will also benefit from participating with other T32

The objective of our LAUNCH program is to continue our global health research training program
called the Global Health Equity Scholars (GHES) designed to create a new community of
researchers, educators, and professionals who are prepared to address new and emerging global
health challenges. We will build on the last nine years of this training program to create a cadre of
new researchers who will dedicate their research careers to address the health problems that arise
out of the inequity of human conditions prevalent in informal human settlements (slums). Rather
than addressing one disease at a time, we propose to provide a comprehensive, multidisciplinary,
and integrated approach to deal with urban and rural informal human settlement health issues,
developed over many years by the participating faculty members of this program. This program
will comprise four US partner institutions (Consortium)--Yale University, Stanford University,
University of Arizona, and University of California at Berkeley, each led by a leader in global health
research with more than 10 years of collaboration among themselves. Together, core faculty
mentors from these institutions conduct research at 25 institutions in 21 countries, representing
regions of Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Asia, the Pacific, and Eastern
Europe. The GHES program will address a wide range of health research topics including
HIV/AIDs, emerging and high- consequence infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases
(NCD), women's health, environmental health, mental health, interpersonal violence, substance
abuse, injuries, and the interaction of all of these health issues within the framework of slum health.
Training will target US postdoctoral fellows and pre-doctoral students and low and middle-income
country (LMIC) postdoctoral fellows. We plan to recruit 9-10 trainees/year with 60% of them as US
postdoctoral fellows. The trainees will spend 8-12-months at an LMIC site under the supervisionof
the Consortium and their collaborating LMIC mentors. Workshops on global health research
methods, skill building, and career development will be conducted both in-person and online. LMIC
trainees will spend 2-3 months at US institutions to undergo training in methods not provided at
their institutions. All of the trainees will be provided with research and career mentorship
throughout their training and tracked for career development after completion of their GHES-
supported research work. Thus, under this program, we expect the trainees to be exposed to one
important theme in global health research--health equity--through research that deals with health
concerns of vulnerable populations residing in informal human settlements and provide them with
an opportunity to become experts in this new global health discipline. The overall impact of this
training programis, therefore, to create a new cadre of global health researchers and leaders who
address the emerging health issues arising out of ever-expanding informal human settlements of
LMICs."

Dissecting the non-growing-but-active state of a hybrid bacteria-material microdevice
Recent work has been interested in engineering commensal bacteria to address various biomedical
challenges, such as specific drug delivery, gene-editing using CRISPR-Cas, and continuous synthesis of drugs
at disease sites. In contrast to non-living devices, bacteria can address these unmet needs because they
already live in the human body and at disease sites, move actively towards stimuli, detect and respond to
stimuli, and synthesize drugs continuously. However, a significant challenge is to prevent the uncontrolled
proliferation of bacteria, while keeping their active functions. To address the challenge, the community must
have a foolproof safety measure that prevents the replication of therapeutic bacteria in any condition. This
measure will ensure that the bacteria cannot replicate in patients and the large ecosystem. Without replication,
mutation is also rare, and mutants cannot spread. Furthermore, a non-replicating entity can be dosed more
precisely than an auto-replicating entity. Thus far, however, attempts to stop bacterial replication also
compromise the therapeutic activity of bacteria. To address this critical bottleneck, my lab has created bacteria
that cannot grow but keep high metabolism by integrating synthetic materials with bacteria. The non-growing-
but-active bacteria continue to synthesize proteins, move, and respond to chemical stimuli. My research will
further investigate the underlying mechanisms that govern the non-growing-but-active state of the bacteria.
The new understanding will then be used to boost and enable specific features of the non-growing-but-active
bacteria relevant for future biomedical applications. I will leverage my prior work about synthetic gene
expression, bacterial information processing, and CRISPR-dCas9 molecular tools. The work will reveal a new
material-protein paradigm for inhibiting growth but preserving the activity of living cells. Furthermore, the work
will enable a superior, safe, and active hybrid bacteria-material microdevice for broad biomedical applications."
11112884,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Recent FDA approval of lecanemab and the potential approval of donanemab offer promise for halting disease
progression among the growing US population of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, many
individuals with AD may not gain access to them because treatment depends crucially on access to diagnostic
PET and MRI imaging technologies, which are expensive and unevenly distributed across the US, and on
access to specialist physicians trained to appropriately refer patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related
dementias (ADRD) to these technologies. Little is known about the racial/ethnic inequities and rural-urban
disparities in access to imaging technologies and to the specialist gatekeepers of these technologies. Our
team's long-term goal is to improve access to new therapies and technologies by analyzing institutional,
market, and regulatory barriers to access, and characterizing the cost, utilization, morbidity, and mortality
consequences of impeded access. The objective in this application is to characterize the US geographic
distribution of PET and MRI facilities and of ADRD specialists, and to quantify racial/ethnic and rural-urban
disparities in technology and specialist access. We will pursue three specific aims: (1) describe the geographic
distribution of PET and MRI neuroimaging facilities and the characteristics of ADRD specialists who refer to
these facilities; (2) quantify racial/ethnic and rural-urban disparities in access to these technologies and to
ADRD specialists; (3) estimate the impact of access to imaging facilities and ADRD specialists on the
utilization of PET and MRI neuroimaging services by race/ethnicity and urbanicity. The proposed research is
innovative because it sheds light on an understudied but important barrier to equitable access to AD care –
limited access to critical imaging technologies – and develops condition-specific linkages between technology
data and data on providers and populations that can serve as a model for data development and further study
of technological health care disparities more generally. The proposed research is significant because it will fill
critical knowledge gaps and identify how imaging resources should be mobilized to ensure that all AD patients
are able to realize the full benefits of new Alzheimer’s treatments. The project's potential impact will be
substantial because project findings will provide guidance to policymakers on imaging technology barriers to
AD care, supporting planning and legislative and regulatory efforts to mitigate disparities in AD morbidity and
mortality."
11115295,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Most daily tasks demand cognitive control, but people vary in their motivation to meet the control demands
required of those tasks. Motivational impairments are a common and transdiagnostic feature of a wide range of
psychiatric and neurological disorders—including major depression, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s—severely
compromising the daily functioning and overall wellbeing of individuals with these disorders. Unfortunately, little
is known about the neurocomputational mechanisms that drive these impairments. We recently developed a
computational model of how people make decisions about control allocation based on an evaluation of the costs
and benefits (the Expected Value of Control [EVC] model). Our model points to several potential sources of
motivational impairments and their putative neural substrates. These include deficits in learning about incentives,
signaling those incentives when expected, and/or properly utilizing those incentives when making decisions
about control allocation. The model suggests that dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) is responsible for integrating
incentive information in order to motivate the level of cognitive control that is most worthwhile. Our model further
points to two dissociable components of the incentives for control: (1) the expected efficacy of control (the extent
to which control is necessary to reach a particular goal) and (2) the expected reward for reaching that goal.
Previous research has primarily focused on the latter component. It is therefore largely unknown how efficacy is
learned and anticipated; how it is integrated with reward to guide control allocation; and to what extent
motivational impairments are caused by deficits in the processing of efficacy. We have developed and validated
a set of tasks that tease apart the independent influences of reward and efficacy on effort allocation. We will
have adult participants perform these tasks while undergoing EEG or fMRI, to characterize the
neurocomputational mechanisms by which expected reward and efficacy are (1) signaled, (2) utilized to
determine effort allocation, (3) updated based on feedback, and (4) generalized to novel stimuli. We predict that
dACC will integrate reward and efficacy information from separate frontoparietal inputs, to determine the amount
and type of control that is most worthwhile. This control allocation will be enacted through dACC’s interactions
with goal-specific prefrontal and subcortical regions. We also predict that reward- and efficacy-selective regions
of frontostriatal and frontoparietal circuits will interact to guide learning and generalization of task incentives. We
will test these predictions with model-based analyses of behavior and neural activity, using our EVC model to
generate participant-specific estimates of incentive processing and control allocation across trials. This research
will offer critical new insight into the computations and circuits underlying the motivation of cognitive control. It
therefore has the potential to inform our understanding of the mechanisms of evaluation and motivation more
generally, and to provide a path towards improving diagnosis and treatment for impairments that are both
prevalent and transdiagnostic."
11114091,"Project Summary: Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death and has for a long time been appreciated to
be a hallmark of cancer cells. In recent years, drugs targeting the apoptotic pathway, such as the FDA-
approved BCL-2 inhibitor, venetoclax, have revolutionized therapy in cancers which have a particular
vulnerability to targeting this pathway. A different programmed cell death pathway, ferroptosis, has recently
been discovered. Understanding which cancers may be vulnerable to the induction of ferroptosis and which
targetable molecules are involved could lead to a new wave of successful cancer therapy. MYCN-amplified
neuroblastoma (NB) is one of the deadliest subtypes of pediatric cancer. Here in, we demonstrate that
amplified MYCN drives an aberrant iron capture program in NB and increases intracellular cysteine
biosynthesis and selenocysteine dependence through multiple mechanisms to detoxify reactive oxygen
species (ROS) accumulation as a result of high cellular iron. The consequence of these MYCN-directed
changes is a synthetic lethality to genetic or pharmaceutical targeting of the glutathione/glutathione peroxidase
4 (GPX4) pathway resulting in ferroptotic cell death. This grant aims to expand our understanding of how
MYCN alters cysteine and selenocysteine production and ferroptotic inducing pathways to sustain an
antioxidant defense and how these pathways may be exploited pharmaceutically to improve therapeutic
responses in this recalcitrant tumor type.
Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Characterize the ability of MYCN to suppress ferroptosis in neuroblastoma
Aim 2: Identification of synthetic lethal ferroptosis resistance mechanisms in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma
Aim 3: In MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma mouse models, evaluate novel ferroptotic combination therapies
Study Design: Using well characterized isogenic cell lines and patient-derived xenograft cell cultures, we will
mobilize expertise in selenocysteine biosynthesis (Copeland), pantothenate kinase inhibitors (Rock), and
genomic screening of ferroptotic pathway modifiers (Olzmann) to better define the ferroptotic vulnerability in
MYCN-amplified NB and to uncover novel sensitizers to ferroptotic inducers in MYCN-amplified NB. The goal
of these experiments is to not only better understand how the MYCN oncogene hijacks cysteine for
selenocysteine production to mount a defense against an oxidized phenotype, but to create new therapeutics
to create better anti-ferroptotic approaches in MYCN-amplified NB. To this end, we will work with our preclinical
mouse model expert (Koblinski) and a NB clinical investigator (Glod) to build the preclinical evidence of
synthetic lethal new therapies into the clinic for refractory NB patients."
11113713,"Project Summary (Parent Award)
Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disease manifesting with severe inflammation and loss of function
of lacrimal (LG) and/or salivary (SG) glands, leading to severe dry eye and dry mouth. SS patients also exhibit
extraglandular systemic symptoms including development of autoantibodies, inflammation of visceral organs and
increased risk of B-cell lymphoma. Pathogenesis is complex and involves interplay between the activated
immune system and exocrine epithelia; thus, SS therapies should ideally achieve both local glandular and
systemic immunomodulation to fully treat the disease. Our initial focus is developing an effective treatment
regimen for SS-associated dry eye disease (DED) and systemic symptoms, using the male NOD mouse which
exhibits these disease manifestations of SS. We later explore efficacy in a model of autoimmune sialoadenitis
and systemic symptoms, the female NOR mouse. Topical treatments are currently used clinically to manage
symptoms of SS-associated DED, but these approaches are insufficient to suppress LG inflammation. Systemic
symptoms are also treated to limited success with general immunomodulatory agents which also lack sufficient
bioavailability to treat glandular inflammation. We hypothesize and test that a combined approach of
optimized local glandular plus systemic delivery of therapeutics is necessary to effectively treat both
glandular and extraglandular symptoms of SS. To achieve this, we use a versatile protein-polymer platform
comprised of elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) that can be genetically fused to peptides/proteins in ways that
optimize their pharmacokinetics and bioactivity. Three Aims are proposed. Aim 1. Local LG
immunosuppression using Supra-LG Rapa ELP depots and Molecular targeting to ICAM-1. The
immunosuppressant, Rapamycin (Rapa), will be complexed to a depot-forming FKBP12-ELP fusion protein that
sequesters Rapa; this carrier will be further modified to target intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1)
increased in diseased LG in SS. In male NOD mice, efficacy will be assessed when delivered supra-LG towards
SS-associated DED and systemic disease. Aim 2. Th17 immunosuppression using systemic delivery of
extracellular IL-17 receptor ELPs. Elevated IL-17A is linked to SS pathogenesis. We develop soluble and
depot-ELP fusions expressing the extracellular domain of the IL-17 receptor (eIL17R) to form multivalent IL-17A-
sequestering nanoparticles for systemic delivery using subcutaneous (SC, flank) administration. In male NOD
mice, efficacy will be assessed in SS-associated DED and systemic symptoms. Aim 3: Efficacy of local and
systemic combination therapies in glandular and extraglandular symptoms of SS. Efficacy of combination
local + systemic treatments will be assessed using formulations delivered by supra-LG (5FV-Rapa) and SC
(soluble eIL17R-A192). Efficacy will be assessed both in male NOD mice (autoimmune dacryoadenitis/systemic
symptoms) and in female NOR mice (autoimmune sialoadenitis/systemic symptoms)."

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Autoimmune Diseases Statistical and Clinical
Coordinating Center (AD-SCCC) and Clinical Data and Safety Management Center (CDSMC) provide ongoing
support for a Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT)-sponsored program to study
autoimmune diseases. Although study endpoints are generally disease-specific and must be both clinically
relevant and ascertainable to that population, there are some common uses of background and concomitant
medications for autoimmune disease where creation of CDEs would benefit study sponsors. Development of
new CDEs and case report forms for concomitant immunosuppressive medications would facilitate the efficient
capture of treatment information and would improve quality in reporting participant disposition and in the
analysis of efficacy for investigational products. This supplement will support the CDSMC in developing and
evaluating a Concomitant Immunosuppressive Medications CDE (CIMC) to capture glucocorticoid use in
autoimmune disease in study datasets.
An interdisciplinary team will review historic approaches to recording immunosuppressive medication use and
then develop a candidate CIMC and test it in a simulation environment. With support from the Cancer Data
Standards Registry and Repository (caDSR), the project team will ensure that any existing, relevant CDEs
registered by other ICs are identified and reused, and the semantics aligned with CDEs from other NIH
projects. NCI will also provide support for producing the finalized CDEs in the NIH CDE Governance Template
for submission to the NIH for endorsement and subsequent loading into the NIH CDE Repository."

PROJECT SUMMARY
The prime objective of our multi-center National K12 “Diabetes-Docs: Physician-Scientist Career
Development Program” (DiabDocs) is to support the research career development of the next generation of
physician-scientists in basic and clinical diabetes for academic careers with a specific focus on type 1 diabetes
(T1D). Our structured K12 program is designed to provide a mentored research experience together with
tailored career development training. Given the historically low rates of persons under-represented in medicine
entering diabetes research careers, we propose and prioritize here intentional evidence-based effort toward
support and funding for these individuals. We propose these aims to achieve the DiabDocs program goals:
1) Create a national cohort of up-and-coming physician-scientist researchers, developing cohesion through
shared programmatic training cohort experiences including an annual retreat;
2) Expand the geographical and pipeline reach of current diabetes K12 programs so that diverse K12 Scholar
candidates can be trained locally while maintaining the historic strengths of the past diabetes K12 programs;
3) Develop an outstanding national mentor community to train diabetes physician-scientists and provide a
more visible pathway to research careers for medical students/residents/fellows by active recruitment
programs and inclusion in the DiabDocs retreat and educational programs;
4) Ensure consistency and effectiveness of mentoring, including directed attention to Diversity, Equity, and
Inclusion (DEI) across research centers through shared mentor training and resources.
In addition to our MPI structure, one of the distinguishing features of our program is the inclusion of all recently-
funded K12 Scholar program PIs and their experience as part of the DiabDocs Executive Leadership
Committee (ELC) complemented by addition of two Adult Endocrinology physician-scientists with expertise in
basic science, health services research, & DEI programs. In addition to these ELC investigators, we have
engaged diverse physician-scientists from 15 additional institutions without K12 programs in diabetes, but with
a strong interest in engaging with DiabDocs. These institutions bring a wealth of expertise including T32, K12,
P30, and CTSA funding. DiabDocs will leverage these resources as well as their wide curricula of study and
research experiences to provide our K12 scholars high quality training from a diverse faculty.
We anticipate funding 55 Scholar Years over 5 years with each Scholar spending up to 3 years on the K12, but
we budget for 2 year terms on average with 27-28 Scholars funded with the goal to obtain independent career
development funding such as a K08/K23. Our K12 scholars will be well-positioned to serve as catalysts for
multidisciplinary investigations bridging bench-to-bedside science leading to patient-centered discoveries. We
are confident that we will attract the highest caliber of applicants and mentor them toward impactful careers in
academic medicine as skilled physician-scientist leaders.

11112187,"Our brain is composed of an immense diversity of neurons that are molecularly, morphologically, and
functionally distinct. Understanding how this immense diversity of neuron types is generated and organized to
allow us and other adult animals to carry out such a vast array of complex tasks and behaviors is of great
importance. By far, most of the neurons in our adult brains are generated during development, either directly or
indirectly from the cell divisions of a defined but, rather heterogeneous population of neural stem cells.
Molecular differences exist among neural stem cells based on their location and neural stem cell themselves
can change their intrinsic genetic programs over time. Research outlined in this proposal is geared towards
better understanding of how neural stem cell extrinsic factors integrate with neural stem cell intrinsic factors to
control numbers and types of neurons produced through time and space during development.
 In the Siegrist lab, we use the genetically tractable model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, to
uncover the genetic pathways and molecular mechanisms regulating neural stem cell proliferation decisions,
from quiescence to proliferation, and then termination once development is complete. Our research goals
include gaining a better understanding of how dietary nutrient availability affects neural stem cell proliferation
decisions. In Drosophila, different neural stem cells respond differently to dietary nutrient availability. Most
enter and exit quiescence in a dietary nutrient- and PI3-kinase-dependent manner, except for a small subset.
The neural stem cells that divide continuously independent of dietary nutrient availability are the neural stem
cells that generate neurons important for memory and learning. Through genetic and single cell sequencing
techniques, we are working to identify the intrinsic differences among these neural stem cell types that
distinguish nutrient-dependence versus nutrient-independence. We are also working on determining how
dietary nutrients consumed during development regulate neural stem cell temporal programs and thus types
and numbers of neurons produced. Neural stem cells in Drosophila sequentially express a series of
transcription factors over time that specify the neuron types produced at each cell division. Whether extrinsic
factors, such as nutrient availability affects neuroblast intrinsic temporal programs is currently unknown.
Finally, we are also working to map out the neural circuitry that regulates neural stem cell proliferation
decisions in response to dietary nutrient availability. Altogether, the research outlined here will advance our
understanding of neural stem cell proliferation control during development and how dietary nutrient availability
affects types and numbers of neurons produced. These insights should stimulate new discoveries in
translational stem cell research in the context of normal development and disease states."

Most gene-based vaccines are replication-defective mRNA, DNA, or adenovirus (Ad) vaccines. In each case,
the vaccine delivers its one copy of an antigen gene and expresses ""1X"" of the antigens that are encoded by the
vaccine. We developed single cycle Ad (SC-Ad) vaccines that replicate vaccine antigen genes up to 10,000-fold
in every cell to amplify antigen production but do not produce infectious progeny viruses. When RD-Ad and SC-
Ad6 expressing HIV-1 antigens or SARS-CoV-2 spike are compared, SC-Ad produces 100 times more antigen
than RD-Ad and generates significantly higher antibodies than RD-Ad-Spike or mRNA vaccines. When spike-
immunized animals were challenged 10.5 months after single immunization, SC-Ad reduced SARS-CoV-2 lung
viral loads and damage and preserved body weights better than RD-Ad.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we tested SC-Ads expressing SIV gag and clade C HIV-1 Env in rhesus
macaques by intramuscular (IM), intranasal (IN), and intravaginal (IVAG) routes of immunization in combination
with IM co-immunization with adjuvanted clade C SOSIP protein. When the macaques were challenged vaginally
with clade C SHIV.CH505.375H.dCT 1.5 years after last vaccine, PBS, IN, and IM vaccinated animals became
infected with similar kinetics with only one IN animal resisting infection. In contrast, 50% of the IVAG macaques
resisted vaginal challenge.
These data suggest there are great merits to creating a mucosal barrier against incoming SHIV at the site of viral
entry. Given this, this project will determine the reproducibility of this protection and examine how vaginal
immunization drives local-regional immune responses in the female reproductive tract (FRT) and if these
responses might be amplified by co-immunization in this site.
Proof of concept here for being able to “push” immune responses into the FRT in macaques will allow these
approaches to be translated for humans, to protect not just women, but all sexes and gender identities from
vaginal, rectal, or penile exposures to HIV-1."

Heart, Lung, Blood, and Sleep (HLBS) conditions such as heart failure, COPD, and pneumonia are among the
most common causes of hospitalizations. Many of such hospitalizations are thought to be avoidable with early
recognition and intervention. Today, patient-reported symptoms represent the primary means of detecting
impending hospitalizations, but because symptoms are late indicators of disease, this results in days to weeks
of delay in receiving care. We developed a non-contact adherence-independent longitudinal bed-sensing
platform to detect early physiologic signs of impending hospitalizations before patients recognize or self-report
symptoms. Preliminary results from our bed-based mechanical sensors suggest that the technology can learn
patient-specific baselines during clinical stability and can recognize excursions from baseline in the early
stages of developing illness. Here, we propose a milestone-based project aimed at collecting human training
datasets and developing generalizable models that can recognize impending hospitalizations in the home with
a focus on the underrepresented populations of San Diego and Imperial Valley counties. We now propose a
administrative supplement to explore its ability to detect ventricular ectopy and arrhythmias. Doing so will
encourage utilization and adoption across HLBS disease verticals and patient subpopulations."
11110679,"Latin America is currently experiencing the largest outbreak of dengue in its history. In the first
months of 2024, there have been a total of 4,820,955 reported cases of dengue. This number is
more than four times more than the number of cases reported during the same period in 2023,
which itself was a record year with over 4.5 million cases. In the case of Argentina, mainly two
serotypes are currently co-circulating (DENV2 58% and DENV1 42%). The recently approved
Takeda Dengue vaccine (Qdenga) is now widely offered in Argentina. The Qdenga Dengue
vaccine protects against all four serotypes of the dengue virus. Two vaccine doses are
administered over a three-months interval.We propose to study the immune responses elicited
by the Qdenga Dengue vaccine in naïve and previously infected individuals before and after the
first and second vaccine doses. We will leverage approaches currently used in VIVA (e.g.,
multiplex chemokine/cytokine measurements [Luminex], high-dimensional cellular responses
[AURORA flow cytometry], transcriptome analysis) to analyze responses to dengue vaccinations
taking advantage of the introduction of dengue vaccines for the first time in Argentina. In addition,
we will compare the results of our current studies with samples from the NIH tetravalent vaccine
trials in Thailand (provided by Dr. Anna Durbin) to the data generated using samples from Qdenga
vaccinees in Argentina. Lastly, we will recapitulate and dissect the Qdenga vaccine responses
using the tonsillar histocultures model system."
10982887,"Biliary atresia (BA) and the other childhood cholestatic liver diseases are significant causes of chronic liver disease in children, and the leading causes for liver transplantation in pediatrics. The initial funding periods leading to the current Childhood Liver Disease Research Network (ChiLDReN) have resulted in unprecedented collections of well-phenotyped subjects, banked data, and biological specimens. Ongoing recruitment of subjects with these rare conditions is critical to allow full attainment to the Study Aims. Socioeconomic and ethnic diversity inclusion is crucial to support meaningful investigation into the pathogenesis of these diseases and the identification of generalizable management strategies. This next funding period will support these ongoing studies, which has broadened since the initial conception of this liver network from biliary atresia to include primary sclerosing cholangitis.
The Seattle Children’s Clinical Center (CC) has the experience, expertise and proven track record essential for ongoing participation in ChiLDReN. Seattle Children’s has the expected volume of patients over time from a unique demographic spectrum, with indigenous populations inclusive of Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians. We are well-poised to contribute outcome data for the participants enrolled in the legacy studies over the past 15 years with the variety of diseases studied by the ChiLDReN network. Furthermore, our enthusiastic recruitment strategies will be critical for the network as we focus on studying biliary atresia and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Our strong Center for Clinical and Translational Research has all the elements necessary to successfully support partnership with pharmaceutical companies or support additional ancillary studies that will complement the Network’s initiatives."
11113394,"PROJECT SUMMARY
RNA modification is an emerging concept because a diverse set of modified nucleotides are found in mRNA
sequences. The m6A modification is catalyzed by RNA methyltransferase complex containing METTL3 that
catalyzes the addition of a methyl group at N6 position of adenosine which affects gene expression via
regulation of RNA metabolism, function, and localization. N6,2’-O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) is an abundant
RNA modification located adjacent to the 5’-end of mRNA 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap structure. Since
m6Am is found at the first transcribed nucleotide in ~30% of the cellular mRNAs, m6Am can have a major
influence on gene expression of the transcriptome. Human Phosphorylated CTD Interacting Factor 1 (PCIF1)
as cap-specific adenosine-N6-MTase (CAPAM), that catalyzes cap-specific m6A methylation on 2’-O-
methylated A at the 5’-ends of mRNAs. So far, the role of m6Am RNA modification and the catalytic function of
PCIF1 in biological and disease processes, especially in regulating viral infections and host-pathogens
interactions have not be determined. Despite remarkable success in treating HIV/AIDS, we do not have a
functional or complete cure for the disease. The molecular networks of host cell regulating HIV-1 transcription,
replication, and latency are not completely understood. The overall objective of this proposal is to delineate the
molecular and cellular mechanisms by which HIV-1 (HIV) infection alters host transcriptional and translational
programs. Our project has three specific aims: Aim 1: Define the dynamics and mapping of human m6Am RNA
methylome by HIV infection and methamphetamine (MA) exposure. Aim 2: Determine how HIV alters m6Am
methylome of host cell. Aim 3: Determine how RNA modifications influences HIV pathogenesis. Successful
completion of these aims will reveal function of PCIF1, and a new regulatory mechanism involved in HIV gene
expression and latency."

The Genetics of Development, Disease, and Regeneration Training Program seeks to foster a broad
foundation of interdisciplinary knowledge and career development that empowers a diverse population of
students to apply their training to the study and treatment of developmental diseases. To achieve this goal, the
GDDR Program is grounded in five training fundamentals: 1) knowledge base, 2) research skills and innovative
technology, 3) hypothesis-driven research, 4) communication skills and 5) professional and career
development. The GDDR Program creates a unique training environment by combining the broad and
interdisciplinary research interests of our faculty with a training plan that integrates genetic principles and
mechanisms into the study of development and stem cell biology. Nineteen well-funded and accomplished
Training Faculty drawn from 6 basic science and clinical departments create a highly collaborative and
interdisciplinary environment. This proposal for supplemental support through the INCLUDE Project seeks to
provide trainees with better access to the resources and intellectual/technical expertise present in Crnic
Institute and Crnic Supergroup at the University of Colorado, in order to equip young scientists with the
technical and professional skills necessary to conduct rigorous and reproducible research with a focus on
Down Syndrome. Trainees supported by this supplement will participate in all the activities that are designed
for other GDDR T32 trainees, thereby amplifying the impact of supplement support by integrating Down
syndrome topics and training into the larger GDDR Training Program. We request that three students be
supported for one year as part of the INCLUDE supplement."
11114250,"Project Summary
This application is from a coalition of Michigan institutions that participated in the first UG3 and UH3 phases of
the ECHO program. Participants in the ARCH cohort were enrolled at first prenatal visit, largely in Lansing, MI,
between 2008 – 2016, 532 of whom were successfully consented for participation in ECHO, and 85% of whom
are up to date on their annual follow-up visits. In 2016, we expanded recruitment to 20 additional clinics sites.
We again recruited at first prenatal visit and created the MARCH cohort, which is a stratified random sample of
births in the lower peninsula of MI. We aimed for a statewide sample of 1,000 births and then chose to enroll
an additional 100 births in Flint, MI, and our current total MARCH study population consented to ECHO (Level
2 participants) consists of 1,084 pregnancies and 955 births. We anticipate having enrolled 1,100 pregnancies
by the end of 2022, and 1,100 births by August 31, 2023. Our follow-up rates at one year (86%), two years
(75%) and three years (76%) exceed what is commonly found in infant/early child follow up studies. We will
further contribute to ECHO science by completing the following aims in collaboration with other ECHO cohorts:
Aim 1. Using data collected in the ECHO core protocol, we will investigate the effects of a) micronutrient levels
in pregnancy; b) early infancy feeding patterns and the gut microbiome; and c) early life adversity at multiple
intersecting levels of maternal, family, and neighborhood stressors, all in relation to our specialized outcome,
neurodevelopment. Aim 2. Using data collected in a specialized protocol, we will study the effects of mixtures
of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), phthalates and heavy metals in pregnancy on child body mass
index, metabolic function, and neurodevelopment. In this aim as well, we will examine the gut microbiome as a
potential effect mediator/modifier. Aim 3. We will follow the more than 1,600 ECHO participants from our
current cohorts and recruit another 540 pregnancies to yield 450 live births consented to ECHO. We also aim
to enroll approximately 225 mothers of the anticipated 450 live births for pre-conceptional data collection from
whom we anticipate enrolling 67 subsequent children to produce a total study sample of some 2,200 Michigan
mother/child pairs. Newly recruited pregnancies will all be from either dominantly African American cities
(Detroit and Flint) or underserved rural communities in northern Michigan to contribute to the size and diversity
of the overall ECHO cohort. Aim 4. We will examine preconception exposures in men that accelerate sperm
epigenetic aging for their effects on offspring neurodevelopment and obesity and test the hypothesis that we
can identify a signature of the extracellular preconditioned secretome in the circulating plasma of pre-
conceptional women that is associated with an increased risk of recurrent preterm birth. When we have
completed our recruitment and detailed assessments of pregnant women, their children, and conceiving
partners where feasible, we will be able to make a very substantial contribution to the overall goals of the
ECHO program, including enlarging the diversity of the ECHO Cohort and contributing to ECHO-wide science."
11112724,"Clostridioides difficile is a gram-positive, spore forming, anaerobic bacteria that is the
cause of the most common healthcare associated infection. C. difficile infections (CDI) are
estimated to cause nearly 450,000 infections and 30,000 deaths within the United States per year.
Since the early 2000s, the epidemic strain identified as restriction endonuclease analysis (REA)
group BI, PCR ribotype (RT) 027 (BI/RT027) has been the most common cause of CDI in the
United States. However, in the past 10 years there has been a drastic change in the molecular
epidemiology of C. difficile as BI/RT027 prevalence has decreased. Furthermore, there is
evidence that healthcare-associated CDI (HA-CDI) is on the decline and community-associated
CDI (CA-CDI) is increasing. One strain identified as REA group Y, which commonly correlates to
RT 014 and 020 [Y(RT014/020)], has been endemic in the United States accounting for >5% of
all CDI since the 1980s. As BI/RT027 associated CDI has decreased over the past 10 years,
Y(RT014/020) related CDI have steadily increased and now account for 10-15% of all CDI. With
the rise in CA-CDI, there is rising evidence that Y(RT014/020) resides within an unknown
community reservoir. Despite a decades long prevalence and increasing concern with CA-CDI, a
detailed molecular analysis of Y(RT014/020) has never been completed. Therefore, our proposal
will be to complete a detailed molecular and clinical analysis in conjunction with a rigorous
genomic analysis of Y(RT014/020) and BI/RT027 to assess the factors which contribute towards
our overarching hypothesis that Y(RT014/020) resides within an unknown community reservoir.
 Support from the career development award (CDA) will provide Dr. Skinner with the
necessary foundation and training to establish himself as a successful VA biomedical and
laboratory clinician-scientist focused on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of C. difficile. The
molecular epidemiology of C. difficile has continually shifted over multiple decades. These shifts
are the results of underlying pathologic factors which influence strain selection. This innovative
project will utilize C. difficile from multiple decades to understand the factors which have allowed
for one strain (REA group Y) to remain endemic for decades. This information could be further
utilized to understand which factors (i.e., antibiotic exposure) place Veterans at risk for developing
a CDI and provide a deeper understanding into the mechanisms by which C. difficile is resistant
to particular antibiotics. Therefore, the completion of this CDA will provide a critical foundation for
Dr. Skinner and results from this project will be used to support Dr. Skinner's VA Merit Review
application to study the mechanism by which C. difficile is resistant to certain cephalosporin
antimicrobials."
11116020,"DEVELOPMENTAL CORE: ABSTRACT
The Developmental Core of the UPSTREAM Research Center will foster innovative and collaborative
research related to the impact of cancer prevention and control in communities with persistent poverty. The
Core will play a key role in advancing the mission of the Center by stimulating novel research directions toward
the upstream fundamental causes of cancer, facilitating transdisciplinary collaboration across Center activities.
The Developmental Core will capitalize on the breadth and depth of research expertise at the intersection of
poverty and cancer at the three Comprehensive Cancer Centers in Northern California: Stanford, the University
of California at San Francisco (UCSF), and the University of California at Davis (UCD). Funded projects will
synergize with, and extend the research performed under Projects 1 and 2, and the Research and Methods
Core. We propose to fund pilot projects in three complementary research tracks: 1) Supporting
community prioritized interventions and projects related to income support and cancer equity, 2) Elucidating
mechanisms linking lack of income to drivers of cancer inequities, and 3) Facilitating collaborative
transdisciplinary projects between early career scholars, clinicians, and community partners. Funds will be
used by investigators and community partners to develop pilot data that will serve as the basis for obtaining
subsequent research funding through external peer-reviewed grants. We will work collaboratively with our
community partners, the Persistent Poverty Initiative Network, and the Network Steering Committee. Aim 1 of
the Core is to administer and support 3 pilot projects per year to catalyze innovative and collaborative research
related to the impact of GBI and EITC programs on cancer prevention and control in our selected communities
with persistent poverty. Aim 2 of the Core is to build capacity for sustainable bi-directional partnerships
between university and community partners to reduce cancer inequalities in persistent poverty areas through
community-driven research. The sustainable products of the Developmental Core activities will be the creation
of novel avenues for collaborative research on the social determinants of cancer in persistent poverty
communities, broad transdisciplinary participation in Center activities, and the career development of pilot
project awardees committed to a focus on research in persistent poverty areas of Northern California."
11116279,"Project Summary
This research will address the critical issue of pain in patients with head and neck carcinoma (HNC), which
significantly impairs their quality of life. Many HNC patients require opiate pain management, but tolerance
develops quickly, necessitating new pain relief approaches. Tyrosine kinase receptors (Trk) have gained
attention due to emergence of small-molecule inhibitors for cancer treatment.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor, TrkB, are known to be overexpressed in oral tumors and
implicated in cancer progression. Additionally, we have demonstrated the role of the BDNF-TrkB axis in oral cancer
pain at the site of tumor growth. Specifically, we have shown that BDNF released from oral squamous cell
carcinoma (OSCC) cells influences pain transmission, which can be reversed by inhibiting TrkB locally. Importantly,
the truncated TrkBT1 isoform that is recently shown to be dominant in oral tumors, is less explored than its full-
length counterpart. Our preliminary data suggest that TrkBT1 is a predominant isoform in trigeminal sensory
neurons as well as in OSCC cells and is involved in oral cancer pain regulation. Accordingly, we propose to test
the central hypothesis that peripherally expressed TrkBT1 in trigeminal sensory neurons and OSCC cells
contributes to sensory neuronal plasticity and tumor microenvironment respectively. Specific aim 1 will include
investigating TrkBT1's role in sensory neurons and its impact on pain behaviors, neuronal plasticity, and gene
expression. Aim 2 will involve examining whether OSCC-derived TrkBT1 regulates pain-associated changes in the
tumor microenvironment by assessing immune cell profiles, transcriptomic changes, and single-cell analysis in
tongue tumors. Additionally, the potential of targeting TrkBT1 for the treatment of oral tumorigenesis and cancer-
induced pain will be evaluated.
 This study will offer novel insights into truncated TrkBT1 biology, oral cancer pathophysiology, and
cancer-induced pain. Findings may have broader implications for other cancer types and orofacial pain
conditions. Translational and medical significance is strengthened by potentially identifying new therapeutic
options for oral cancer and cancer-induced pain.
RELEVANCE: It is often very difficult to treat pain from oral cancer with available medications due to limited
effectiveness or rapid development of tolerance. We propose a highly novel mechanism that will evaluate the
peripheral role of Truncated TrkB (TrkBT1) isoform in oral cancer pain. This study's relevance lies in its potential
to uncover novel therapeutic targets for managing oral cancer-induced pain and improving patients' quality of
life. By investigating the role of TrkBT1 in both sensory neurons and the tumor microenvironment, the research
may pave the way for innovative treatments that address pain and oral tumorigenesis simultaneously."
11116282,"Project Summary
More than 20% of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients present with bone invasion and require
maxillary/mandibular continuity restoration after tumor excision. Postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy or
chemoradiotherapy is also needed for advanced OSCC tumors. However, despite standard-of-care treatments,
the 5-year survival rate for advanced-stage OSCC is less than 50%. Notably, adverse effects of radiotherapy
can impair bone formation and delay graft osseointegration after reconstructive surgery. Patients receiving
adjuvant radiotherapy have an approximately 20% long-term failure rate because of nonunion of bone grafts,
hardware infection, and ultimately flap malunion and loss. Thus, a safer and more effective therapeutic with
strong osteoinduction and anti-OSCC capacities are needed to improve reconstructive surgery outcomes of
OSCC treatments. MicroRNAs (miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that play crucial roles in craniofacial bone
metabolism and OSCC initiation and progression via epigenetically regulating cellular biological processes.
miRs have emerged as a potential tool to improve OSCC treatment and reconstructive bone regeneration. Our
previously funded studies have demonstrated that miR-200c targets many proinflammatory cytokines and
osteoclastogenic mediators and effectively attenuates inflammation and bone resorption. Local application of
plasmid DNA (pDNA) encoding miR-200c also significantly promotes osteogenic differentiation of hBMSC and
bone regeneration by activating Wnt and BMP activities. pDNA miR-200c incorporated into 3D-printed
scaffolds or delivered by CaCO3-based nanoparticles effectively enhance bone regeneration at calvarial and
maxillary defects. In addition, our preliminary studies have identified that radiation in OSCC patients and rat
mandibles suppress miR-218 expression, a miRNA similar to miR-200c that potently suppresses OSCC and
osteoclastogenesis and promotes bone regeneration. Therefore, we hypothesize that pDNA encoding miR-
200c and miR-218 delivered by CaCO3 will promote bone regeneration and bone graft integration in irradiated
mandibular bone defects by improving osteogenesis and mitigating inflammation and osteoclastogenesis. We
propose to determine the functions of miR-200c in promoting mandibular bone regeneration under radiation
and preventing bone graft resorption (Aim 1) and the additional/synergistic function of miR-218 in miR-200c-
mediated bone regeneration (Aim 2). We will also elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) and cellular effects
underlying anti-OSCC radiation and osteoinductive miRNAs (Aim 3). After accomplishing the project, we
expect to lay the groundwork for developing a novel miRNA-based therapeutic that will enhance
osteoinduction and suppress bone resorption for advanced OSCC patients."
11116337,"Accidental exposure to chlorine (Cl2) causes potentially fatal lung injury accompanied, in survivors, by reactive
airway disease and pulmonary fibrosis resembling symptoms typical of the acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS). Our preliminary data also document that the mitochondrial genome–the integrity of which is critical to
maintenance of normal bioenergetics and mitochondrial signaling activities– displays oxidative damage after Cl2
gas exposure, similar to that detected in other models of acute and chronic lung injury. Against this background,
here we propose to test the hypothesis that an early molecular target in Cl2 gas inhalation is the
mitochondrial (mt) genome, in which oxidative damage functions as a molecular sentinel leading to
activation of pro-inflammatory pathways that drive acute lung injury and progressive lung remodeling.
To address this hypothesis we will perform the following in vivo and in vitro studies outlined in the following three
aims: Aim 1. Define the kinetics of lung oxidative mtDNA damage in mice exposed to Cl2 gas and returned to
room air and test whether a novel agent to augmenting mtDNA injury decreases mortality and the severity of
acute and chronic lung injury. Exp. 1.1 will determine the time course of Cl2 gas-induced lung mtDNA damage
and its relation to lung pathophysiology in global (mitochondrial and nuclear) OGG1 knockout mice (OGG1-/-)
and their wild type (WT) controls (C57BL/6), along with OGG1 KO mice reconstituted with mito-targeted OGG1
(OGG1-/-+OGG1mt), while Exp. 1.2 will test if intranasal administration of mitoOGG1 at selected time points after
termination of Cl2 exposure decreases lung injury pulmonary fibrosis and improves survival. Aim 2: Test the
hypothesis that Cl2 gas-induced lung mtDNA damage triggers mobilization of mtDNA Damage Associated
Molecular Patterns (DAMPs) that drive nucleic acid-dependent inflammation and serve as biomarkers and
causative agents of pneumotoxicity. In Exp. 2.1 will use WT, OGG1-/-, and OGG1-/-+OGG1mt mice to test the
hypothesis that OGG1 activity coordinately regulates Cl2 gas-induced mtDNA DAMP accumulation and activation
of nucleic acid receptor-mediated pro-inflammatory pathways. Aim 3: Determine key cellular mechanisms by
which Cl2 gas causes mtDNA damage-dependent lung cell death and dysfunction. In Exp. 3.1 we will isolate
alveolar macrophages (AM) and lung epithelial type II cells (ATII) from WT, OGG1-/-, and OGG1-/-+OGG1mt
mice, and measure oxygen consumption rate, reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential, ion
transport and key indices of cell injury prior to and following exposure to Cl2 gas. Additionally, Exp. 3.2 will define
the mtDNA damage-dependent trafficking of mtDNA DAMPs to cytosolic and extracellular compartments and
determine how these two mtDNA DAMP pools interact to dictate pro-inflammatory nucleic acid receptor
activation. As part of this experiment, we also will determine if exogenous mtDNA DAMPs recapitulate nucleic
acid receptor activation and inflammation evoked by Cl2 and use Dnase1 to degrade extracellular mtDNA DAMPs
to define the specific effect of mtDNA DAMPs originating from this compartment."
10770542,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Opioid use disorder (QUO) is a public health challenge that affects millions of people worldwide. Evidence
supporting the efficacy of three FDA-approved medications for OUD (MOUD), including methadone,
buprenorphine and naltrexone, is well established. MOUD also constitutes an important intervention in patients
who are dually diagnosed with OUD and HIV infection; successful use of MOUD is associated with improved
HIV viral suppression. However, most patients with OUD remain untreated. Expanding access to MOUD has
been hampered by various challenges in the cascade of OUD care (i.e., diagnosis, treatment initiation and
retention, and recovery). Important questions remain about which factors may enhance retention in treatment
and reduce both dropout from and cycling on and off MOUD therapy. Furthermore, enhancing knowledge
about real-world effectiveness and guiding optimal use of MOUD in the clinical care of patients is also of
critical importance. This proposal will use data from the Veterans Health Administration, the largest integrated
healthcare system in the United States, along with rigorous analytic techniques, to address this urgent
knowledge gap centering around OUD care. In Aim 1 (K99), I will characterize dynamic cascades of care
among patients with OUD and among patients with both OUD and HIV, and identify predictors of treatment
engagement, disengagement, and re-entry into treatment. In Aim 2 (K99/R00), I will evaluate real-world
effectiveness of clinical management strategies on OUD and HIV, including the effect of buprenorphine
prescription in primary care settings versus in substance use specialty settings on OUD outcomes, and the
effect of MOUDs on HIV viral suppression among patients with both OUD and HIV. In Aim 3 (R00), I will
estimate optimal treatment strategies for MOUD to guide personalized treatment decisions. This proposed
research will provide a structured model for evaluation and optimization of OUD care.
I received my Ph.D. in Epidemiology from the University of North Carolina Gillings School of Global Public
Health, with research focus on HIV/AIDS. I am currently a postdoctoral associate in the Department of
Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases at the Yale School of Public Health. The career development plan, which
aligns with the research proposal and a multidisciplinary mentorship team, outlines a comprehensive strategy
for acquiring expert knowledge and analytical skills for my research career. Specifically, I will receive training
in: 1) science in substance use research and pharmacoepidemiology, 2) expert knowledge on the intersection
of OUD and HIV, 3) skills in dynamic modelling and stochastic processes, and 4) integration of machine
learning methods and causal inference theory. Successful completion of this training plan will provide me with
skills and knowledge necessary to become an independent investigator and epidemiologist studying infectious
diseases and substance use with advanced causal inference and big data analytics."

11114288,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In this study we seek to understand how genetic factors influence the risk of developing obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD) in Latin American individuals. OCD and related disorders are of major public health importance
owing to their profound personal and societal costs. Little is known for certain about their etiology, and
treatment, detection and prevention strategies are not optimal or directed by knowledge of pathophysiology. In
other psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and autism), genomics has begun to deliver
fundamental knowledge about genetic architecture, identify specific loci for biological follow-up and localize
pathways altered in disease. We intend to realize these same advances for OCD by markedly increasing and
diversifying the worldwide sample size for genomic analysis, in a first step toward elucidating the fundamental
biology of this condition.
Three overlapping areas will be investigated in this project. First, we will collect the world’s largest ancestrally-
diverse sample of OCD cases (N = 5,000 individuals from Latin America). To do this in an efficient and cost-
effective manner, we will take advantage of a network of OCD clinics we have established across Latin
America, in addition to clinics in the USA and web-based recruitment. The phenotypic data collected will
include a detailed clinical characterization including comorbidities and OCD symptom dimensions. Second, we
will genotype all 5,000 samples on the Illumina Global Screening Array (genotypes for >10,000 matched
controls will be available). This will allow us to, in collaboration with the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium,
discover genomic loci harboring common variation associated with OCD. Third, we will fine-map genome-wide
significant loci and calculate individual polygenic risk scores (PRS) as a measure of genetic liability to OCD.
We expect the new inclusion of ancestrally diverse samples to improve our fine-mapping ability, to yield more
accurate PRS in non-European samples and ultimately to reduce health disparities when OCD genomic
findings are used clinically. Overall, this study will improve our understanding of the causal mechanisms
implicated in OCD, with a view towards improving clinical outcomes and reducing chronicity and societal costs."
11116405,"The goal of this project is to increase emergency preparedness to respond to a mass casualty
radiological/nuclear incident through the development of a biodosimetry triage device. Under the
parent NIAID U01 award, the ASELL team is developing CellRADx, a point-of-care biodosimetry
triage device that incorporates Complete Blood Count (CBC) with WBC differential, along with
the detection of extracellular and cell-surface biomarkers of radiation exposure. This triage
device will incorporate an exposure assessment algorithm also being advanced under the
parent award, that can utilize inputs from CBC differential measurements from any appropriate
source. To date, iterations of the CellRADx algorithm functionally based on the HARI algorithm
have shown promising performance at dose determination, especially in the later time periods.
Under this Administrative Supplement, ASELL proposes to improve the performance of the
algorithm based on feedback from the FDA and release of a new FDA guidance document on
the credibility of simulated data. The additional tasks proposed herein; therefore, are Algorithm
Performance Improvements, and demonstrating the credibility of our In Silico Acute Radiation
Blood Cell Depletion Model. Areas of algorithm improvement include: 1) use of alternative
algorithm equations, 2) incorporation of time effects into the algorithm, and 3) incorporation of
demographic effects into the algorithm. To address the practical limitations of available human
clinical data, ASELL will pursue use of an in silico hematopoietic cell depletion model to be used
in combination with retrospective real-world human data sources to build a “virtual clinical
cohort” for future clinical studies. ASELL intends to follow the recently released (November
2023) FDA Guidance “Assessing the Credibility of Computational Modeling and Simulation in
Medical Device Submissions.” These tasks will address regulatory inputs and collectively
strengthen development and validation of CellRADx as a qualitative biodosimetry tool for large-
scale radiation triage."
11111905,"R33 Phase Abstract
The purpose of this project is to implement an automated risk assessment and cognitive screening
application (RACS app) in primary care settings and to validate its clinical utility. The study aims have not been
modified from the original application and are to refine and further validate the RACS app with diverse patient
populations, assess the usability of the tool by primary care providers (PCPs), and implement and test
procedures for integrating the tool into multiple electronic health systems. We hypothesize the following:
1. The cognitive processing (CP) score of the RACS app will exhibit good classification accuracy in
detecting cognitive impairment when compared to an established brief cognitive assessment tool, the
Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment (Qmci) screen, and to a more comprehensive neuropsychological test
battery (NTB);
2. The CP score will detect cognitive decline over time as determined by rate of change on the Qmci and
NTB and by pre-established indicators of progression pulled from the medical record (e.g., functional
decline, need for cognitively enhancing medication, diagnosis of cognitive disorder).
3. The RACS app will be rated as useful and easy to use by clinic staff and require minimal staff time.
A total of 500 older adults will be recruited from two primary care clinics affiliated with The University of
Texas (UT) at Austin, the Family Wellness Center (FWC) and UT Health Austin’s Primary Care Clinic (PCC).
Participants will be recruited consecutively according to the following inclusion/exclusion criteria: (1) Aged 60
years and older; (2) ethnic/racial background consistent with NIH policy; (3) male or female; (4) fluent in
English, (5) no confounding conditions that could impact ability to participate in the study (e.g., cognitive
impairment sufficient to impact ability to follow instructions on the iPad, motor impairment that would prohibit
independent use of RACS, poor visual acuity), and (6) no prior diagnosis of dementia. Enrolled participants will
complete the RACS app and Qmci at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months later and will be asked to complete
an optional brief NTB at baseline and 12 months. Clinic staff who use the RACS app will be asked to complete
a usability questionnaire after each of the first 10 uses.
Means, standard deviations, and proportions will be computed to describe the study groups and to summarize
dependent variables. Correlational analyses will be conducted to explore relationships between the CP score
and demographic characteristics of the sample, as well as between the CP score, Qmci, and NTB global
composite Z score. Classification accuracy of the CP will be compared to that of the Qmci and NTB. To
determine usability of the RACS app, we will employ qualitative and quantitative methods to examine the 20-
item USE questionnaire and time stamps for use of the RACS app.
Successful completion of this project has the potential to make a significant impact on early detection of
cognitive decline in a low-cost, low-burden manner. By providing an automated tool developed specifically to
address the needs of PCPs, it will be easier to screen for cognitive impairment, increasing the number of older
adults who are screened and subsequently identified as cognitively impaired. Early identification of individuals
with cognitive impairment will facilitate earlier application of appropriate interventions and participation in
research trials, which has both personal and societal benefits."

Since its inception in 2012, the UJMT Fogarty Global Health Fellows Program—led by the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, Johns Hopkins University, Morehouse School of Medicine, and Tulane University—has
provided a critical pathway to global health research careers. Our 252 trainees have collectively secured $88.5
million in grant funding, a nearly 600% return on the NIH’s investment. During the current grant cycle (2017-
present), our 110 doctoral scholars and postdoctoral fellows have published a collective 287 manuscripts,
including 109 as primary author. The vast majority remain involved in global health research and many have
already obtained independent grant funding. In the coming grant cycle (2022-2027), under the new LAUNCH
initiative, we build upon these strengths to further improve and expand our program. First, we will provide
enriching 12-month mentored training opportunities at affiliated research sites in 16 countries. We draw upon a
talented pool of US and international candidates, jointly recruited from 12 domestic and 17 international training
programs funded by the NIH. Our expert mentors support experiential learning on site, while the program
provides a central training framework that monitors progress through individual development plans, core skills
checklists, and regular group check-ins. Over the course of the five-year award, we expect to support at least 60
positions via base funding; in line with the RFA, 60% will be US postdoctoral fellows. Second, we will continue
to foster research in scientific areas identified by in-country stakeholders. This includes topics described in the
RFA (e.g., HIV/AIDS, non-communicable diseases, cancers, mental health, neurologic disorders), as well as
other longstanding priorities within our host countries (e.g., infectious diseases, women’s health, child health,
environmental health). Third, we will enhance our training curriculum. We have developed a new Research
Leadership Academy for Global Health, building upon our team’s experience in global health and leadership,
institutional resources, and collaborations with other US government programs. We also provide individually
guided research methodology training and scientific writing support, using proven approaches. Fourth, we will
increase the participation of underrepresented groups in global health research, by identifying and addressing
barriers, emphasizing diversity in recruitment efforts, fostering diversity during the fellowship year, and
supporting a pipeline of future candidates. Fifth, we will monitor, evaluate, and learn from our activities to
iteratively improve the quality of our trainee experience. We utilize a conceptual framework that considers both
process and performance to ensure that the specific aims of the program are met. Finally, the UJMT LAUNCH
initiative will be led by a team of committed global health researchers—and a broad network of engaged
collaborators, both in the US and abroad—with the expertise and experience to carry out its ambitious aims.
Through this program, we will train a diverse group of productive, independently funded, research leaders who
are prepared to tackle the most pressing global health issues in the years to come."

The multiple, massive, and rich Big Data streams in healthcare (e.g., electronic health records, mobile
technologies, wearable devices, genomic data) and the emergence of advanced information and computational
technologies (e.g., machine learning and artificial intelligence) offer an invaluable opportunity for applying
innovative Big Data science research in NIAID focus areas of infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and
COVID-19. Big Data science has the potential to identify high-risk individuals and communities and prioritize
them for early biomedical or public health interventions, predict long-term clinical outcomes and disease
progression, and evaluate public health policy impact. Key to addressing these complexities is a critical mass
of health researchers with adequate knowledge, competencies, and skills to unlock important answers from Big
Data to better understand, treat, and ultimately prevent these diseases and related comorbidities. However,
there is a nationwide shortage of talent with such knowledge, competencies, and skills, especially in traditional
academic settings. While junior faculty, as part of the generations of digital learners, have the greatest potential
to develop their Big Data health science research agenda, many face multiple structural barriers to conduct Big
Data science research. Such barriers include a lack of protected time to initiate new interdisciplinary Big Data
research, lack of opportunity to participate in funded Big Data research, and a lack of adequate mentoring. To
address these gaps, we propose developing a “Big Data Heath Science Fellow” program for early career junior
faculty (i.e., assistant professors) at health science schools (e.g., medicine, public health, nursing, pharmacy,
social work) at the University of South Carolina (USC). Specifically, we plan to recruit 4 USC health science
junior faculty per year and provide them with protected time (25%) to participate in the comprehensive training
program, including: 1) courses for competency and skill development in Big Data research and professional
development; 2) participation in hands-on research and grant proposal development; and 3) rich mentoring
experience in Big Data research and professional development. The proposed training program will be
implemented with the support of the existing infrastructure of the USC Big Data Health Science Center
(BDHSC), one of USC’s Excellence Initiatives. BDHSC’s mission is to promote and support Big Data health
science research at USC and across SC through capacity development, academic training, professional
development, community engagement, and methodological advancement. BDHSC contains 5 content cores
(electronic health records, geospatial, genomic, social media, and bio-nanomaterial data) and 2 supporting
hubs (business/entrepreneurship and technology) with the involvement of 43 faculty from 10 USC
college/schools. The proposed training will be an integral component of the BDHSC professional development
mission. Upon the accomplishment of the proposed training, each trainee will be expected to: 1) obtain hands-
on mentored research experience on an NIAID-funded project; 2) develop at least one Big Data-related
manuscript on HIV or COVID-19; and 3) submit one grant application to NIAID or other appropriate funding
source. The training program will foster a research environment to encourage individuals from diverse
backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups, to pursue further Big Data health science
research in HIV, COVID-19, and other NIAID focus areas."

 The element iron plays an enormous role in biology, including electron transport reactions
(ferredoxins), oxygen transport and storage (hemoglobin and myoglobin), catalysis
(nitrogenase, P-450, hydrogenase, and thousands of other enzymes), small molecule sensing
(especially O2, CO, and NO), and DNA processing and repair. The health-relatedness of a better
understanding of the structure and function of biological Fe is clear.
 The general theme of research in the Cramer lab involves the use spectroscopy as a tool for
characterization of metals in biological systems. Much of this work involves the application of
synchrotron radiation x-ray sources. Thanks to enormous improvements of these sources,
experiments with exquisite sensitivity can now be conducted on dilute Fe samples. This includes
the technique Nuclear Resonance Vibrational Spectroscopy (NRVS), which is sensitive to the
motion of 57Fe in a sample. The x-ray experiments at international facilities are complemented
by IR and Raman measurements at the home lab.
 Pump-probe spectroscopy of sample in cryosolvents at temperatures down to -100°C and
also at temperatures close to 4 Kelvin is a major part of this project. A Nd:YAG OPO combination
will be used to pump the sample (initiate photochemistry) and a quantum cascade laser (QCL)
or FT-IR will be used to probe the subsequent reaction products.
 A cryostat for conducting experiments down to 4 Kelvin is essential for this work.
The goals for the remaining 2 years can be divided into 2 major themes:
· better understanding of the catalytic intermediates of the enzymes that process hydrogen –
 [NiFe] and [FeFe] hydrogenases, and
· information about structural changes that occur when Fe-S cluster proteins sense their
 environment, including mitoNEET and NAF-1, two health-related proteins which sense and
 communicate pH and redox status.
 The overall vision of this research program is to use spectroscopic methods to better
understand how iron is used in important proteins, in ways that complement the information
that can be gathered from diffraction and microscopy. In the course of research on specific
topics, spectroscopic techniques will be further developed for the bioinorganic community."
11100745,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is fundamental to normal cellular homeostasis. The current
model in the field of biology is that mRNAs exist primarily as ‘full-length’ molecules that are ‘protected’ from
decay by ribosomes during translation. The long-established understanding is that mRNA decay is initiated by
deadenylation followed by decapping and subsequent exonucleolytic decay from both ends. Co-translational
mRNA decay is known to occur mainly in defective mRNAs. Existing next-generation sequencing methods that
profile mRNA decay target either the 5’ or 3’ ends, thus missing information about the other end that could
illuminate new insights into mRNA decay. During my post-doctoral training, I developed several novel
transcriptome-wide sequencing methods that concurrently select both ends of mRNAs. I discovered a novel
mechanism of co-translational decay of canonical mRNAs that involves repeated endonucleolytic cleavage
events, mediated by translating ribosomes that we named “ribothrypsis”. Ribothrypsis is conserved between
humans and yeast. We identified the unexpected ribosome-phased mRNAs fragmentation and found that
deadenylation is not a prerequisite for mRNA decay. Our discovery of ribothrypsis revealed that co-translational
mRNA decay is more widespread than previously thought. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
ribothrypsis is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for modulating gene expression that can be triggered by
numerous factors to recruit an unknown endonuclease that we termed “ribothrypsin”. We propose here to
capitalize on our past discoveries and leverage cutting-edge novel RNA sequencing methods to achieve a
comprehensive understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of ribothrypsis and its regulation. In this
proposal, we will investigate (i) the impact of cellular conditions that induce ribosome stalling on RNA decay
intermediates; (ii) the conservation of ribothrypsis in other eukaryotes; (iii) the identity of ribothrypsin; and (iv)
the role of RNA modifications in triggering ribothrypsis. These goals are mirrored by our long-term objective to
understand the mechanisms that underlie RNA decay dysregulation in human diseases. The molecular insights
gained in this proposal could also broaden our understanding of ribosome biology and RNA modifications."

 This proposal is focused on the development of high frequency dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to enhance sensitivity in NMR based structural biology experiments.
1 CW DNP at 527 GHz/800 MHz: The 800/89 magnet with a sweep coil and console is operating. We
plan to use the 800 MHz/527 GHz system to examine amyloid proteins and other interesting systems and to
develop the methodology to perform DNP experiments at high fields. This is the sole 527 GHz/800 MHz
DNP instrument available for biophysics experiments in North America.
2. Applications to Peptides and Proteins: The familial mutants of A which lead to early onset AD,
are sparsely available. Thus, and structural studies require methods with high sensitivity and we intend to
determine the structure of the Arctic mutant, E22G-A1-42, and other familial mutants, such as D23N.
2 High Resolution 17O NMR: With new isotope labeling procedures, high fields, and high spinning
frequencies which improve sensitivity, it is finally possible to record high resolution spectra of 17O. We plan
to incorporate DNP in 17O experiments to increase sensitivity and to examine model systems GGVVIA to
develop the methodology and to 17O label proteins for structural studies.
3 Time Domain DNP Experiments: To translate pulsed DNP to 250 GHz we have developed a series
of new swept frequency and pulsed DNP experiments. Using a fast AWG, and a TWT amplifier operating at
250 GHz, we will investigate off resonance NOVEL, the frequency sweep integrated solid effect (FS-ISE)
and the stretched solid effect (SSE) and new versions of time optimized DNP (TOP DNP) as approaches for
time domain polarization transfer. These should eventually replace standard CW techniques like the solid
effect and cross effect.
6 1H Detected DNP: We propose to develop methods for 1H detected DNP of 13C, 15N and 17O
resonances using recently developed diamond rotors and a helium recirculation system that will permit
r/2>100 kHz at 90 K. The system will initially use 1.3 and 0.7 mm ZrO2 rotors and we will convert to laser
machined diamond rotors which we have successfully produced that will spin at >100 kHz. The recirculation
system will also be useful for spinning at ambient temperatures at >200 kHz and will permit design of a
variety of new pulse experiments for structural studies."
11100747,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) integrate diverse signals generated by hormones, growth
factors, neurotransmitters, and changes in metabolic state to modulate downstream signaling in all cell types.
IP3Rs are ligand-gated ion channels that are further regulated by allosteric and covalent mechanisms,
mediating Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The resulting increases of cytoplasmic and
mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations regulate many physiological processes (e.g., learning, memory, membrane
trafficking, synaptic transmission, secretion, motility, membrane excitability, gene expression, cell division, and
apoptosis). Furthermore, pathological dysregulation of IP3Rs and calcium signaling is implicated in cancer,
neurodegenerative, autoimmune, and metabolic diseases, making IP3Rs promising targets for treatment of
these diseases. Despite recent advances in structural studies, fundamental questions regarding the
mechanisms of ligand interactions and channel gating remain mostly unanswered, in part because of the large
size and complexity of IP3Rs and the limited availability of specific pharmacological tools.
 In this proposal, we will (Aim 1) combine cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and X-ray crystallography
in conjunction with functional IP3R assays based on fluorescence-based calcium imaging to elucidate the
general themes of IP3R gating cycle and molecular basis for receptor inhibition by small molecules.
 Our recently published data revealed that the IP3 binding site is occupied by a loop that we have termed
the self-binding peptide (SBP), which is located distantly in the primary sequence. We hypothesize that the
SBP is a novel regulatory site in IP3Rs that can modulate the apparent affinity for IP3, and thereby Ca2+
channel activity, and that the divergence of SBP sequences between IP3R subtypes contributes to their distinct
regulatory properties. We will perform (Aim 2) functional and structural studies on IP3R subtypes and SBP
mutants to test this hypothesis and identify the structural determinants of this interaction.
 Completion of these aims will yield unparalleled mechanistic insight into IP3R gating and regulation,
potentially leading to the development of novel and specific pharmacological modulators of IP3Rs. In addition
to being used as a long-sought research tools to study IP3Rs, these compounds will serve as a starting point
for development of novel therapeutic approaches to treat diseases associated with aberrant IP3R activity."
11100901,"Glycolipid biointerface to decipher disease-implicated ganglioside-protein interactions
 All cells in the human body, including neurons, immune cells, epithelial cells, and blood cells, are
coated with a dense layer of glycoproteins and glycolipids known as the glycocalyx. The extraordinary
complexity in structural organization and biosynthesis of the glycocalyx has made it very difficult to
comprehend the precise roles it plays in various cellular processes and thus limited its potential as
therapeutic target. An important family of molecules of the glycocalyx is gangliosides, which participate
in a wide array of intercellular events such as modulating killer cell toxicity, controlling neural regeneration,
and promoting cell adhesion during inflammation. Gangliosides are found to play important roles in
altering and mediating affinity properties of the membrane proteins in certain cancers, and are clearly
implicated in insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes. However, the biochemical mechanisms of gangliosides’
effect on tumor and type 2 diabetes appear to be extremely complex, and a major portion of ganglioside
pathology remains elusive. Lack of suitable techniques is a main obstacle that has principally limited the
research on gangliosides and restricted our ability to understand their roles on protein function.
 We propose to build a highly effective, glyco-diverse, biomimetic membrane interface system and
a new bioanalytical platform to study the ganglioside-protein interactions implicated in several diseases
at the molecular level. A ganglioside library will be created for construction of interface mimics with
precisely controlled glycan moiety, composition and packing biophysics as observed in those disease
states. The proposed approach bypasses complex endogenous synthesis of gangliosides, and creates
a novel hosting environment with programmed tuning in ganglioside makeups for elucidating structure-
function relationships with the membrane proteins. The effect of gangliosides on protein interactions will
be primarily investigated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, which quantifies molecular
binding and affinity changes under systematically varied composition and headgroup moiety (Aim 1). We
will then study and understand the inhibitory/promoting function of gangliosides on proteins EGFR and
VEGFR, angiogenic activators linked to progression of cancer (Aim 2), and on interactions of insulin,
insulin receptor and caveolin-1 (Aim 3), a key system implicated in insulin-resistant type 2 diabetes."

 The polymorphic transporter OATP1B1 plays significant roles in the hepatic uptake and disposition of
endogenous molecules and drugs. Further, OATP1B1 is involved in numerous drug-drug interactions (DDIs) due
to its multispecificity. Despite decades of research, many factors related to the determinants of ligand binding,
transport mechanism and energetics, as well as the structure of this important transporter are unresolved. The
long-term goal is to characterize hepatic transport at the microscopic and macroscopic levels. Due to the
functional importance of OATP1B1 in liver clearance, this is the first target studied. The central hypothesis is that
structures of human OATP1B1 and functional assays performed on isolated proteins will unequivocally define
the mechanism of ligand binding, transport, and inhibition. The rationale that underlies this research is that
protein structures coupled with unambiguous, reproducible activity assays are absolutely required to fully
characterize the mechanism of transport and resolve long-standing conflicting data reported in the literature.
Establishing robust expression and purification protocols for human OATP1B1 facilitates pursuing the two
Specific Aims: 1) Resolve structures of OATP1B1 by Cryo-EM and analyze their motions by MD simulations. 2)
Functionally characterize the transport mechanism of OATP1B1. For the 1st Aim, the optimal conditions that
result in the highest image quality for Cryo-EM of OATP1B1 would be screened, and data would be acquired in
the presence and absence of ligands. The Cryo-EM studies will be augmented by MD simulations and docking
studies that would reveal details that are not accessible by mere structural analysis. The different biochemical
conditions (apo and holo) increase the likelihood of A) solving the structural determinants of the binding of various
ligands (with distinct chemistries) to the two ligand-binding sites of OATP1B1. B) solving the structures of multiple
conformations that are part of the transport cycle. For the 2nd Aim, we will use purified protein reconstituted into
proteoliposomes to characterize the inherent properties of OATP1B1 such as the energizing ion for transport,
the influence of the membrane voltage, and pH. Those results would be compared with cellular assays that
include intact cellular machinery, and other plasma membrane transporters that might directly or indirectly affect
OATP1B1. The research proposed in this application is innovative, in the applicant’s opinion because it
introduces two methodologies that have never been explored for any OATP isoform. These could uncover a
plethora of novel insights into the structure/function relationship of OATP1B1. The proposed research is
significant since OATP1B1 is involved in DDIs of several commonly prescribed drugs, sometimes resulting in
life-threatening situations. This study would unravel the exact determinants of ligand binding to OATP1B1 and
transport. Ultimately, the structural and functional knowledge generated here has the potential to aid in the design
of drugs that exhibit a lower propensity for DDIs."
11100607,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Meiosis is the cell division process in which a diploid cell undergoes one round of DNA replication
followed by two rounds of chromosome segregation to ultimately produce haploid gametes. Errors in meiotic
chromosome segregation can result in miscarriage and trisomy conditions, such as Down syndrome.
Therefore, studying meiotic chromosome segregation is important for understanding how errors in this process
occur. The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms that regulate proper chromosome
segregation, focusing on unique events in meiosis I and meiosis II. These studies leverage the model organism
S. cerevisiae, due to the ease of developing tools to address mechanistic questions. These innovative tools will
allow the investigation of how cells establish microtubule-kinetochore attachments, how cells correct improper
attachments, and how cells monitor the attachments through spindle checkpoint activity, which delays the cell
cycle in the presence of unattached kinetochores. The rationale for the proposed research is that the questions
focus on processes that are unique to meiosis but are likely to be highly conserved, allowing the findings in
budding yeast to uncover general mechanisms of meiotic regulation. Strong preliminary data guide the
following three specific aims: 1) determine how the number of crossovers and crossover position along the
chromosome affects the establishment of correct kinetochore-microtubule attachments in meiosis I; 2)
investigate how cells prevent persistent spindle checkpoint activity during meiosis; and, 3) determine how the
phophoregulation of proteins at the meiotic kinetochore ensure proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments in
meiosis II. In the first aim, strains have been developed to target crossovers at particular locations on a
chromosome arm. Using time-lapse imaging, the strains will be monitored for the timing of establishing
bioriented kinetochore microtubule attachments, and for the number of rounds of error correction of improper
attachments. The second aim tests the novel hypothesis that cells have a developmentally programmed
mechanism to overcome persistent spindle checkpoint activity in meiosis to ensure the production of gametes.
The third aim analyzes how protein phosphatases counteract kinase activity to specifically ensure kinetochore
assembly and the establishment of kinetochore-microtubule attachments specifically in meiosis II. The
innovative approach of combining the latest imaging technologies to monitor kinetochore-microtubule
attachments in engineered strains allows the testing of novel hypotheses about cell-cycle regulation. The
proposed research is significant because the results are expected to reveal general principles of meiotic
regulation important for proper chromosome segregation. Ultimately, the results will further our understanding
of how errors in meiosis facilitate developmental abnormalities."
11100781,"Project Summary We are requesting funds to purchase a qPCR machine, a cell culture incubator, and a cryostat,
for the purpose of studying the molecular mechanisms underlying spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) establishment,
self-renewal, and differentiation. SSCs are self-renewing stem cells essential for adult spermatogenesis that hold
promise for treating male infertility, a condition affecting >200 million men world-wide. The parental NIH grant is
focused on experiments to better understand SSCs as a foundation to develop such SSC therapy. The 3 items
requested—a qPCR machine, a cell culture incubator, and a cryostat—are all essential for these studies. First,
the primary goal of Aim 1 of our NIH grant is to test the hypothesis that transcription factor (TF) circuits are
critical for the initial generation of SSC from SSC precursor cells (called prospermatogonia [ProSG]). All 3 pieces
of equipment requested will be essential to test this hypothesis. qPCR analysis will measure the expression of
germ cell stage-specific gene markers as a means to determine ProSG and SSC frequencies in all 3 Subaims
in Aim 1. For example, qPCR analysis will be used on the different transgenic mouse models we are employing
to test our primary hypothesis in Subaim 1.1 – that a RHOX10-DMRT1 TF circuit drives SSC establishment in
vivo. The cryostat will be used to make sections from dissected testes from these transgenic mouse strains to
provide single-cell information on the specific germ cell subsets in vivo. Immunofluorescence (IF) analysis will
be used on these sections to assess the expression of ProSG and SSC protein markers at the single-cell level.
The cell culture incubator will be used to perform the experiments in Subaims 1.2 and 1.3 described in the
parental NIH grant, which are focused on defining TF cascades in cultured ProSG and SSCs in vitro. Culturing
these ProSG and SSCs will require a dedicated cell culture incubator, set at 34oC to mimic the temperature of
the testis. Extensive qPCR analysis will also be required for these Subaim 1.2 and 1.3 experiments. Second,
we are testing 3 models (delineated in Aim 2 of our parent grant) that explain our surprising finding that the loss
of the RHOX10 TF causes expansion of SSCs in adult testes. All 3 pieces of equipment requested are critical to
test these models, following the same approaches, as described above. Third, we are studying the conserved
role of the Activin A and AKT pathways in both human and mouse SSCs in vitro, which will require the requested
qPCR machine and cell culture incubator. Fourth, we are defining and characterizing novel protein markers
labeling different human spermatogonial subsets harboring SSCs, which will require a cryostat for IF analysis.
Finally, we are studying how the nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway influences SSCs and other
stages of spermatogenesis, a study that requires all 3 requested equipment items."
11100932,"Summary
Emerging evidence shows that changes in cellular metabolism can induce broad shifts in gene
expression, but the mechanisms underlying this connection are not fully understood. Previous
work has not examined the impact of temporal dynamics on metabolism-induced gene
expression. Recent work in systems biology has shown that oscillations in upstream inputs can
be filtered by gene expression machinery to modulate gene expression, through a process
termed dynamic filtering. Additionally, we have recently shown that cellular metabolic status
fluctuates rapidly in response to various forms of metabolic stress. These cycles drive
asynchronous oscillating activity of transcription factors including FOXO3, a key regulator of
stress genes that plays a role in aging, and TFEB, a central regulator of lysosome and
autophagy genes. We therefore hypothesize that oscillations in metabolic state drive gene
expression programs that are distinct from those under static unstressed conditions. We
propose that dynamics-sensitive gene expression programs can influence cell fate decisions
such as differentiation, cell growth, senescence, inflammation, and drug sensitivity. In this
project, we will investigate how metabolic oscillations control the expression of TFEB and
FOXO3 target genes. We will use live-cell reporters, inducible expression constructs, and other
methods to measure key kinetic parameters in the transcription and translation of target genes.
To identify broader gene expression programs modulated by metabolic dynamics, we will use
mathematical modeling in combination with transcriptome-level profiling. Functional assays will
be used to test how dynamically sensitive gene expression programs alter cell fates. We expect
our study to establish an important unexplored mechanism that explains how short-term
regulation of cellular metabolic status influences chronic diseases including cancer, diabetes,
and aging. Our results will address the outstanding question of how pharmacological metabolic
inhibitors such as metformin provide benefits in cancer and aging. The models generated will
establish a new approach to evaluate candidate pharmacological compounds."
11113555,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Nearly 40 million people in the United States annually are provided anesthesia for surgery. Reactive
aldehydes, produced during surgery, are toxic metabolites which drive cellular dysfunction and end organ
damage. For Asian Americans that are descents from East Asia a genetic variant (present in nearly 540
million people in the world) severely limits reactive aldehyde metabolism. Besides inefficient reactive aldehyde
metabolism, several other genetic differences occur for Asians within the lipid peroxidation pathway; a pathway
which regulates damage that occurs during organ injury. As mortality following surgery is the third leading
cause of death in the United States, with organ injury a major cause of this mortality, understanding how these
genetic differences in Asians may alter lipid peroxidation-induced organ damage could unlock novel treatment
strategies for all ethnicities to reduce organ injury occurring during surgery.
For this MIRA program, we will study the genetic differences existing within the lipid peroxidation pathway for
Asians, including the genetic variant which causes inefficient reactive aldehyde metabolism and the impact on
organ injury. To carry out these studies, we generated tools to study reactive aldehydes in the basic science
laboratory including a knock-in mouse model to reflect the human genetic variant that causes inefficient
reactive aldehyde metabolism and sensitive assays to detect reactive aldehydes. We will use these tools to
examine whether an analgesic given during surgery exacerbates cellular injury for rodents with inefficient
aldehyde metabolism. Further, we will also study how reactive aldehydes may impact a transient receptor
potential channel to trigger organ injury. We also expanded these aldehyde tools by developing non-invasive
methods to assess reactive aldehyde levels in humans and methods to identify phenotypes for inefficient
reactive aldehyde metabolism. We plan to use these tools in humans undergoing surgery to identify people
with inefficient reactive aldehyde metabolism and monitor their aldehyde levels during surgery in real-time.
Asian Americans are one of the fastest growing populations in the United States and are projected to reach
nearly 34 million by the year 2050. Asian Americans will require specific anesthetic plans for surgeries due to
genetic differences in the lipid peroxidation pathway, including genetics which cause inefficient reactive
aldehyde metabolism. Providing precision medical care for people who require surgery with this genetic
variant will ultimately reduce health care costs and improve quality of care for a large subset of Asian
Americans. As we describe here, studying genetic differences can also provide insight into biological
mechanisms and unlock novel strategies that can impact medical care for people of all ethnicities."

productive, well-trained, independent researchers at both the pre- and post-doctoral level as CIH research
leaders in investigating efficacy, effectiveness, mechanisms of action, and implementation of clinical integration
of complementary therapies and integrative health-care approaches. Our program highlights an

research methods to facilitate exploration of mind-body techniques and natural-product/nutritional therapies
and their applications in health promotion, chronic pain, metabolic syndrome, and other high-impact conditions,
with emphasis on enhancing access to CIH care in at-risk, underserved populations. The original proposed
Fellowship submission planned for five post-doctoral positions and two pre-doctoral positions; however, our
funded grant was reduced to five overall positions, with NIH/NCCIH providing the opportunity to apply for
supplemental funding for an additional fellow who qualifies as a Complementary and Integrative Health
Practitioner, to enhance NIH goals for diverse practitioner trainees. This application, following NOT-AT-24-033,
proposes the addition of Dr. Rebecca Molinini, as a post-doctoral fellow. Dr. Molinini has a 2010 doctoral
degree in Physical Therapy (DP) and a 2023 PhD in Rehabilitation and Movement Sciences. Her dissertation
research focused on the effect of early motor delay and physical therapy (PT) on the parent-child relationship.
She is committed to continuing her research career in PT with an emphasis on the role of mind-body therapies
in enhancing the parent-child relationship as part of the rehabilitation process for pre-term infants. This is a
high-need area of research, with a dearth of practitioners trained in both pediatric PT and integrative health
research. Dr. Molinini’s proposed training plan includes required training in the Responsible Conduct of
Research, Rigor and Reproducibility, Integrative Health, and mindfulness. She will also take short courses and
training to build her skills in qualitative research methods, rehabilitation research grantsmanship, and
neuroimaging research methods. In addition, Dr. Molinini proposes to enhance her training related to
mindfulness and self-compassion and their relevance to the parent-child relationship in rehabilitation. Dr.
Molinini will be mentored by a team of experienced UNC faculty with combined expertise in PT research (Dr.
Lewek and Dr. Cassidy), mindfulness research and integrative health research methodology (Dr. Gaylord and
Dr. Lathren), and neuroimaging/EEG (Dr. Cassidy). The department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation,
where the T32 resides, is an ideal setting for this trainee’s career maturation and learning to take place."

Synthetic photochemistry is a powerful tool for biomedical research. The small-molecule therapeutics that
constitute the core of modern molecular medicine occupy a relatively narrow segment of chemical diversity
space. Photochemistry offers a new capability that can expand the range of chemical structures that can be
investigated for their biological activity and their potential as new life-saving drugs. Specifically, reactions
that are driven by light can use the energy of a photon to produce highly reactive intermediates that react in
ways that are not accessible by other means.
Our group's research focuses on the discovery of reaction methods that can control the outcomes of
photochemical processes in predictable ways. We have a long-standing interest in the development of
mechanistically novel catalytic processes that are directly applicable to the synthesis of complex bioactive
compounds. We are also interested in the use of external stimuli that can control or divert the intrinsic
reactivity of open-shelled photogenerated intermediates towards desirable synthetic goals. Finally, we are
deeply committed to elucidating the mechanisms by which photochemical transformations occur.
The next phase of our research will continue to investigate these broad themes. We propose investigations
into new strategies for controlling the stereochemistry of diverse photochemical reactions. We will study a
new approach towards the generation of carbocationic intermediates from photoredox activation. Finally, we
will develop a new class of photoreactions that take advantage of the direct photochemistry of base metal

11100562,"Project Summary:
Food allergy affects approximately 5-10% of young children, with highest incidence in the first
year of life. Food allergy accounts for almost $25 billion per year in U.S. costs. Atopic dermatitis
[AD] (also known as eczema) is a major risk factor for food allergy and other allergic diseases,
and also has a significant intrinsic impact on child health. AD affects approximately 13% of U.S.
children, of whom approximately 1/3 have moderate to severe disease. AD is a chronic disease
characterized by skin barrier disruption and inflammation, with ongoing major effects on the
quality of life of children and families. Currently, there is no reliable way to identify those infants
destined to develop atopic disease who would benefit from targeted prevention strategies. The
goal of this study is to establish a birth cohort that collects prenatal and early life environmental
and bio-samples and rigorously phenotypes young children for food allergy and AD to identify
prenatal and early life markers of high risk for food allergy and AD."
11115010,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This K23 application proposes novel research in opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment in a correctional
healthcare setting and a robust training plan to support the successful transition of the Dr. Justin Berk, MD
MPH MBA (PI) to independent clinician-scientist. His background in public health, health management, and
clinical medicine creates a strong foundation for further development as an expert scientist. He has assembled
a highly accomplished and diverse team of nationally recognized mentors and advisors with complementary
expertise in clinical trials and other research among vulnerable populations including qualitative methodologies
and implementation science. The proposed research work will provide hands-on experience instrumental to Dr.
Berk’s career progression as a clinical trialist preliminary data for a future multi-site R01 application. The
Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC) is an ideal setting for this type of pilot study.
 Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are an effective treatment in the community and among
incarcerated individuals. Given the high prevalence OUD in jails and prisons and the high risk of opioid
overdose upon release, the criminal justice (CJ) system offers a targeted opportunity to engage individuals in
treatment initiation. Despite the strong evidence-base for MOUD, few correctional facilities offer these life-
saving medications. A shifting policy landscape in legislation and court rulings will lead to more facilities
offering MOUD treatment. Delivery barriers, however, still exist. A new injectable extended-release form of
buprenorphine (XR-B) can help overcome these barriers, though there is no published literature on its
effectiveness or implementation in a CJ setting. This K23 proposes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to
demonstrate preliminary effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of XR-B and uses a concomitant process
evaluation, with frameworks frequently used in implementation science, to investigate how this novel treatment
modality may be used in a CJ setting to prevent opioid overdose in the high-risk time of re-entry to the
community.
 The specific aims of this K23 proposal include: (Aim 1) Compare XR-B initiation to treatment-as-usual
sublingual buprenorphine among incarcerated individuals on treatment engagement, re-incarceration,
overdose, buprenorphine adherence, and illicit opioid use. (Aim 2) Conduct a process evaluation using the RE-
AIM evaluative framework and iPARIHS implementation science framework to assess the implementation of
XR-B initiation and identify facilitators to and barriers of MOUD treatment in a CJ setting.
 In order to achieve these aims and move towards research independence, Dr. Berk will receive training
and experience in clinical trial research, including supporting qualitative methodologies and implementation
science, and build a career to conduct high-impact and ethical research in a marginalized population."
11114625,"Project Summary
Background: The metastasis of cancerous cells to distant and vital organs is responsible for in excess of 90%
of cancer mortalities. Given this extraordinarily high mortality rate, there is a significant need for the development
of novel therapeutic approaches that either eliminate metastatic cancer cells or eradicate incipient cancer cells
prior to metastatic dissemination. An important barrier to tumor progression and metastasis is anoikis, a caspase-
dependent cell death program induced by loss of integrin-mediated attachment to extracellular matrix (ECM).
However, it has become clear that ECM-detachment can induce anoikis-independent mechanisms that can
compromise cell viability. More specifically, we have discovered that detachment of non-cancerous epithelial
cells from ECM triggers a significant elevation in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which compromises
cell survival in an anoikis-independent fashion. The understanding of the cellular changes that contribute to the
elevation of ROS during ECM-detachment remains rudimentary and the strategies utilized by cancer cells to
combat ROS during ECM-detachment are insufficiently explored. Therefore, these points represent significant
knowledge gaps that this grant proposal aims to address. Discernment of mechanistic information regarding
the links between ECM-detachment, ROS, and cell survival could provide targets for the design of the therapeutic
approaches aimed at specifically eliminating ECM-detached cancer cells; an outcome that may have significant
impact for patients with metastatic disease.
Objective/hypothesis: In aggregate, our preliminary studies have unveiled a novel cell death mechanism (with
a tumor suppressive function) that compromises the viability of ECM-detached cells: the induction of mitophagy
as consequence of RIPK1 signaling. As such, these data have motivated our central hypothesis that RIPK1-
mediated mitophagy during ECM-detachment functions as a barrier to breast cancer progression.
Specific Aim I: To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which ECM-detachment promotes RIPK1-dependent
mitophagy and initiates cell death.
Specific Aim II: To assess the capacity of RIPK1-mediated mitophagy to antagonize tumor formation in vivo
and to evaluate antioxidant inhibition as a novel strategy to limit tumorigenesis in cancers that are deficient in
RIPK1-mediated mitophagy
Anticipated Outcomes: Following the completion of these studies, we will have accumulated significant
mechanistic knowledge regarding the relationship between ECM-detachment, RIPK1 mitophagy, and cell death.
Thus, the completion of these studies will unveil fundamental biological insights regarding cancer cell
survival during ECM-detachment that may ultimately lead to the development of therapeutic approaches
to limit the dissemination of breast cancer cells."
11101203,"Project Summary/Abstract
The contribution of individual disease-relevant genes to brain development still remains unknown. The long-term
goal of our laboratory is to elucidate the intersection of molecular signaling pathways that are disrupted in
neurodevelopmental disorders with those pathways that are important for specific aspects of brain development.
Two members of the FOXP family of transcription factors, FOXP1 and FOXP2, have been linked to monogenetic
forms of intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, and specific speech and language deficits. Variants in
FOXP1 or FOXP2 are among the most significant genes associated with autism spectrum disorders. We
previously showed that Foxp1 and Foxp2 both have significant contributions to cortical and striatal development.
We linked these developmental changes via studies of gene expression, electrophysiology, and behaviors. We
further identified non-cell-autonomous changes in gene expression using newly available single-cell RNA-
sequencing technology. Based on these data, the central hypothesis driving this proposal is that Foxp1
and Foxp2 are key orchestrators of transcriptional signaling cascades in a cell type-specific manner that
are important for neuronal function and are at risk in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. We
propose to identify these cell type-specific contributions in the developing cortex by using rodent models through
three specific aims: 1) Determine the cell type-specific gene expression programs regulated by Foxp1 in the
developing cortex; 2) Determine the cell type-specific gene expression programs regulated by Foxp2 in the
developing cortex; and 3) Assess the role of Foxp1 and Foxp2 in cell type-specific activity-dependent neuronal
function. Together, these aims will delineate the cell type contribution of both Foxp1 and Foxp2 to cortical
development. The rodent models and cell-type specific genomic datasets will aprovide insight into the basic
molecular mechanisms governing normal mammalian brain development."

11100708,"Project Summary
Cellular stress-responsive mechanisms are essential for cells to adapt to various environmental and
physiological conditions. The overall goal of the research program is to understand how cells regulate mRNA
translation as part of their stress adaptation process. Of particular interest is a pathway referred to as the
Integrated Stress Response (ISR), which is initiated by stress-activated eIF2a kinases that respond to several
distinct types of stress. Abnormal regulation of ISR is associated with various metabolic and neurodegenerative
diseases, including ribosomopathies caused by heterozygosity in ribosome subunit genes and Charcot Marie
Tooth Disease caused by certain tRNA synthetase mutations. The ISR signaling mechanism is intriguing
because this pathway induces stress-responsive gene transcription, and coincidentally, suppresses general
mRNA translation. ISR inhibits mRNA translation at multiple levels, including the specific inhibition of translation
initiation factors, eIF2a and eIF-4E. In addition, recent evidence indicates that ribosome stalling on mRNAs is
associated with ISR. These observations raise a fundamental question regarding how stress-responsive
transcripts overcome these multiple translational blocks, and in some cases, increase their translation as part of
ISR signaling. To address this, we propose to use the facile genetic tools of Drosophila. The ISR regulatory
mechanisms are conserved in this organism, and there are genetic mutations that serve as models for human
diseases with abnormal ISR signaling. Our preliminary genetic screen in Drosophila has identified several
poorly characterized translational regulators as factors required for ISR signaling. Building on these
observations, we will test the central hypothesis that the newly identified factors specifically mediate the
translation of stress-responsive transcripts, thereby helping those mRNAs to bypass translational blocks
imposed by ISR. We will further determine the physiological significances of the newly identified translational
regulatory mechanisms in the Drosophila models of ribosomopathies and Charcot Marie Tooth Disease. A
successful realization of the proposed plan will advance our conceptual understanding of stress-responsive
gene expression, and help develop new therapeutic strategies against diseases associated with ISR."
11114667,"ABSTRACT
Targeted cancer therapy, in the form of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, has been a game changer for patients with
cancers driven by activating mutations in genes encoding these proteins. Yet, while we are seeing overall survival
beneﬁts unlike with any new agents in over a decade, cures remain elusive, or non-existent, as resistance to
these agents reliably emerges. The process driving this resistance is the same process that drives invasive
pests' resistance to pesticides, pathogens' resistance to antibiotics and many other phenomena in life: Darwinian
evolution. While this is being increasingly recognized, it has yet to change the paradigm in cancer research where
most projects are centered on a hunt for actionable mutations conferring resistance. While these secondary
mutations are often druggable themselves, we submit that this is a never-ending race that evolution will always
win. We hypothesize that an approach centered instead on studying the evolutionary process itself can help
break this cycle. While there is a robust theoretical literature modeling cancer evolution with mathematics, there
is a relative paucity of research connecting this theory to empirical biology or clinical medicine. To address this
shortcoming, we have worked for the past three years to develop a ﬁrst-in-class evolutionary game assay to
directly measure the eco-evolutionary interactions driving the emergence of resistance in vitro. This assay allows
us to directly parameterize an evolutionary game theoretic model with empiric studies in any system. Here, we
propose to extend our initial observations revealing a vast heterogeneity in evolutionary dynamics under different
agents in vitro to allow for clinical translation by extend ouring assay to an in vivo system. We posit that the new
methods and understanding we will gain during this proposal will beneﬁt the cancer research community as a
whole, as well as provide novel opportunities for therapeutic interventions aimed at disrupting and altering the
evolutionary mechanisms driving resistance."

institutions (<$6 million in NIH funding, >25% PELL eligible students) prepare and submit competitive NIH
grants applications, with an emphasis on SuRE and SuRE-First awards. To accomplish this goal, UK faculty
and research support staff with experience in all aspects of NIH grant applications will share their
knowledge with those at SuRE-eligible institutions through a series of webinars, workshops, and direct
consultation. Three regional coordinators will provide vital links between faculty and OSP staff at SuRE-
eligible institutions and faculty and research support staff at UK-SuRE. This center will also coordinate
biennial SuRE Conferences and oversee a competitive seed grant program that will provide funds for
SuRE-eligible institutions to establish or grow OSPs. Specifically, four aims are proposed: (1) Assist SuRE-
eligible faculty write grants and manage research programs, with success being measured by number of
grants submitted, scored, and funded; number of publications, seminars; and meeting presentations; and
tenure and promotion outcomes; (2) Assist SuRE-eligible institutions to establish and grow OSPs and
research infrastructure, with success being measured by growth/establishment of OSPs in SuRE-eligible
institutions, number of research grants received and overall research funding at these institutions, and
questionnaires for SuRE faculty regarding the quality of in-house OSP services; (3) Grow the number of
institutions that participate in the SuRE Program and establish an interactive community of SuRE-eligible
institutions, with success being measured by the number of institutions that participate in webinars, attend
the biennial conference, and submit NIH grants (with an emphasis on SuRE applications), as well as the
amount of peer-to-peer faculty mentoring and social media engagement; and (4) Enhance the research
experience for students who are working in NIH-funded labs in SuRE-eligible institutions, with success
being measured by student conference presentations, authorship on publications, degrees earned, and
post-graduate employment. Taken together, these activities will enhance the research capacity at SuRE-
eligible institutions and promote high-quality, student-centric biomedical research. In the process, these
outcomes will contribute to diversifying and strengthening the nation’s research enterprise."

The overarching goals of this supplement are to understand: (a) how to enhance engagement and participation
of hard to reach populations in the UAS, and (b) what is currently missing in our understanding of the sources
of inequality due to the lack of representation from certain parts of the population. We will conduct focus
groups and in-depth interviews to understand barriers to, and facilitators of, participation in the UAS for
populations in disadvantaged communities, as well as to understand current knowledge gaps, with the intent to
then develop and test (and eventually implement) a strategy for increasing their representation in the UAS. To
be sure, there is no assumption that eventually all interviews will be self-administered and web based. Both the
interview mode and questionnaire content will be determined by our findings in this project. Our specific aims
are as follows:
Aim 1: Investigate the challenges with the UAS’ current recruitment process, survey modality, and frequency for
marginalized populations.
Aim 2: Enhance understanding of how the UAS should investigate how inequality accumulates over the life course
among marginalized groups
Aim 3: Develop a strategy for increasing representation of individuals from marginalized populations into the UAS"

Project Summary
 Gross chromosomal rearrangement (GCR) is a hallmark of cancer cells and the
cause of structural variant formation in genetic disorders. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)
are a major source to induce GCR, but the details on how the DSB repair process leads to
genome instability in cancers and other genetic disorders remains elusive.
 Microhomologies are prevalent at chromosomal break junctions in cancer and other
human diseases, suggesting that microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) is one major
player to mediate GCRs. Repetitive sequences are abundant, constituting about half of the
human genome, which raises the question of how recombination between repetitive
sequences is suppressed to prevent genome instability. In this proposal, we aim to
investigate the mechanisms underlying MMEJ and repeat-mediated recombination in
mammalian cells.
 We have established multiple EGFP-based DSB repair reporter systems, which
enable us to study different DSB repair pathways in mammalian cells. By using newly
established MMEJ reporters, we identified new players in the MMEJ pathway. We will
investigate how these MMEJ players regulate MMEJ to balance its usage and its mutagenic
consequences. We will also study the biological role of MMEJ in repairing replication-
associated DSBs and in coping with replication and oncogenic stress, and address how
MMEJ contributes to genome instability and the oncogenic process. Additionally, we will
determine the mechanisms of repeat-mediated recombination in causing deletions and
translocations, and study the role of heteroduplex rejection in preventing recombination
among divergent repeats. These studies will generate much-needed new knowledge to fill
the gap in our understanding of DSB repair mechanisms and the cause of genome
instability that is associated with the oncogenic process and other genetic disorders."
11100935,"1 This MIRA project will advance understanding of the function of tyrosine sulfation, a fundamental
 2 modification that regulates diverse biological functions. For example, sulfation plays a critical role
 3 in entry of HIV into human cells, in the interaction of microbial molecules with host immune
 4 receptors and in the activity of tick-derived peptides, which hold potential for treatment of blood
 5 clotting associated with cardiovascular diseases. Despite the increasing awareness of the
 6 importance of tyrosine sulfation, most sulfated peptide complexes have not yet been fully
 7 characterized. Further, we have only a partial view of the components essential for transducing
 8 the response of such activated complexes. We also have limited strategies for efficiently
 9 producing and testing the therapeutic potential of sulfated molecules. The PI is well positioned to
10 address these challenges. With support from the NIH, the PI discovered the host XA21 immune
11 receptor, a protein that is representative of a large class of plant and animal receptors. Further,
12 the PI’s team isolated and characterized a sulfated peptide secreted by a Gram-negative
13 bacterium that binds to the XA21 receptor and activates the immune response. We propose
14 research in three related areas: We will isolate and characterize the diversity of receptors that
15 bind sTyr peptides, identify and analyze sTyr binding interfaces and pioneer a strategy to produce
16 novel sulfated molecules in an efficient manner. To accomplish our goals, we will employ new
17 experimental tools and approaches. These include use of established whole genome sequenced
18 mutant lines to rapidly assess phenotypes of newly discovered genes, sensitive assays to assess
19 ligand binding, state-of-the-art mass yeast cell surface display and spectrometry approaches to
20 engineer receptors and identify key components of immune complexes. The knowledge gained
21 from this research will provide new insights into an essential biological process, laying the
22 foundation for the development of reagents capable of inhibiting or activating cellular interactions
23 with a high degree of affinity and specificity with potential applications in research, agriculture and
24 medicine."

Advances in technology and data preprocessing have enabled the generation of diverse and complementary
multiomic, multimodal data, with rich information that offers remarkable opportunities to understand biological
processes involved in complex diseases and transform medicine. Analyzing multiomics and multimodal data
to obtain useful information and knowledge is challenging because the data are complex, heterogeneous, and
high-dimensional, requiring a considerable level of analytical sophistication. The amount of data to be handled
during training and real data applications can be massive, and traditional central processing units (CPUs) may
struggle to handle the size of the data. Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) are essential for handling big data
since they offer parallel processing capabilities that can significantly speed up training tasks. The Minnesota
Supercomputing Institute (MSI) addresses the high-performance computing needs of research groups at the
University of Minnesota, providing excellent resources with free CPU and GPU time, memory, and storage, up to
a certain limit. The resources at MSI are shared by the entire research community at the University of Minnesota
and have a queue system that limits the number of tasks that can be run, sometimes leading to job submission
failures and delays in job execution. Since our simulations for the parent grant are closely linked to real data
projects and our applications sometimes require loading large data into memory, we need computing resources
that are fast, parallelizable, have a large amount of memory and storage available, and can be executed without
delay to speed up our training and testing processes. We are requesting funds to purchase computing resources
from MSI specifically for our research group since the MSI allocation is not enough to meet our computational
needs. This will eventually improve our training and testing processes. Ultimately, our methods and algorithms to
be developed have the potential to narrow the gap from raw molecular data to biological insights, offer opportunity
to expand the definition of complex diseases, and allow to stratify patients and identify those who might benefit
from targeted interventions."

Three receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMP1-3) in humans heterodimerize with the class B G protein-
coupled receptors (GPCRs) calcitonin receptor (CTR) and calcitonin-like receptor (CLR) and modulate their
responses to calcitonin (CT), amylin, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and two adrenomedullin (AM)
peptide hormones. These have functions in bone remodeling (CT), regulation of food intake and blood glucose
(amylin), and regulation of blood and lymphatic vasculature function (CGRP and AM) by activating one or more
of seven receptors arising from CTR, CLR, and the RAMPs (6 heterodimers + CTR alone). The receptors are
drug targets for osteoporosis (CTR), diabetes and obesity (amylin receptors), migraine headache (CGRP
receptor), and cardiovascular and lymphatic system disorders (AM receptors). How RAMPs modulate CTR and
CLR ligand binding and signaling is incompletely understood. This limits our understanding of the molecular
basis for the diverse peptide actions in vivo and hinders drug development. Notably, there is growing evidence
that RAMPs interact with numerous GPCRs so understanding this model system will have broad impact. In
prior funding cycles we used biochemistry, pharmacology, and X-ray crystallography to reveal how CT, CGRP,
and the AM peptides bind their receptor extracellular domains (ECDs) and how the RAMP1/2 ECDs alter CLR
ECD peptide selectivity. Guided by these results we developed ultra high affinity CGRP and AM variants
including picomolar affinity antagonists and sustained signaling agonists that exhibit persistent cAMP signaling.
Herein we continue to define the mechanisms of RAMP modulation of CTR and CLR ligand binding and
signaling and further characterize our novel peptide variants, which may have therapeutic potential. In Aim 1
we define the kinetics of peptide binding at CGRP and AM receptors (CLR:RAMPs) and its relation to cAMP
signaling kinetics using biochemical and pharmacological assays (SPR and BRET kinetic methods). In Aim 2
we continue to define the structural bases for RAMP modulation of peptide binding to the CLR and CTR ECDs
using advanced molecular dynamics simulations and X-ray crystallography. In Aim 3 we employ a novel
biochemical assay to define how RAMPs modulate agonist and G protein coupling to CTR to enable amylin
signaling. Completion of this project will yield the following outcomes: 1) an understanding of how peptide
binding kinetics affects cAMP signaling kinetics for CGRP and AM receptors and the molecular basis for
sustained signaling of ultra high affinity variants, 2) a near complete high-resolution structural understanding of
calcitonin family peptide binding to their receptor ECDs including pathways of CGRP and AM peptide binding
and unbinding, and 3) clarification of longstanding amylin receptor pharmacology ambiguities and delineation
of how RAMPs modulate CTR. This project will advance our understanding of accessory membrane protein
modulation of GPCRs and aid the development of therapeutics targeting CTR/CLR:RAMP complexes."

HIV/AIDs, emerging and high- consequence infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases
(NCD), women's health, environmental health, mental health, interpersonal violence, substance
abuse, injuries, and the interaction of all of these health issues within the framework of slum health.

Dental implants restore chewing function to at least 100 million individuals and the market continues to grow
15% annually. However, over one million implants fail every year due to peri-implantitis, a disease that is
triggered by disruption of the intricate balance between the microbial ecosystem that colonizes the peri-implant
sulcus and host immunity. Our ability to prevent and treat peri-implantitis is hampered by a paucity of
information on inter-microbial and host-microbiome interactions in this ecosystem. Therefore, there is an urgent
need for biological investigations that will improve our understanding of how this ecosystem is colonized and
when, why, and how this homeostasis breaks down. Based on our discovery of a robust viral presence in this
ecosystem, we hypothesize that that interactions between implant surface, bacterial and viral communities and
the host barrier are critical for homeostasis, and that an abandonment of these transactions moves the
ecosystem towards chronic inflammatory programming. We propose to test this hypothesis by combining two
novel clinical study designs with integrated ‘-omics’ approaches, image analysis and computational
bioinformatics and validating them using a unique in vitro model of the titanium-tissue-microbiome interface,
the IMiTATE that we have developed. This approach will bridge the gap between clinical outcome-based
studies and in vitro investigations or animal models, both of which have limited capabilities to replicate human
behavior and physiology. First, we will create a functional atlas of the peri-implant sulcus from its moment of
inception to the establishment of a climax community using dual transcriptome-metatranscriptome sequencing,
viral metagenomics and transcript-guided imaging. Second, we will pinpoint timelines for breakdown of
mutualism by combining a multi-arm, longitudinal clinical study with a network analysis algorithm. Finally, we
will validate these discoveries with the IMiTATE. The proposed studies will bring us closer to understanding the
etiopathogenesis of peri-implant diseases, provide biologically-validated timelines for assessing risk, and
develop indicators or predictors of disease."

Successful treatment and management of oral mucosal lesions depend on a definitive, accurate, and timely

leading to poor prognosis. Most OSCCs are preceded by oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs), which
are a heterogeneous group of clinical oral lesions associated with a statistically increased risk of malignant
transformation. The existing histopathological diagnosis for OPMD is subjective and unable to predict
malignant transformation risk for individual OPMD cases, leading to challenges in precancerous oral lesion
management. To fill the important medical gap in OPMD risk assessment, we propose an innovative Fourier
Transform Infrared (FTIR) based multimodal imaging diagnostic platform, which integrates three
complementary modalities: FTIR imaging for biochemical pattern recognition, histological imaging for
morphological feature identification, and spatial transcriptomics for gene expression profiling. We will also
employ cutting-edge machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for feature extraction and
predictive model development. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the integration of FTIR imaging
with histological imaging and spatial transcriptomics techniques aided by ML/DL provides quantitative,
objective, and accurate risk assessment for individual OPMDs. To test the hypothesis, we propose the
following three specific aims: 1) Develop ML/DL models using the FTIR imaging technique for OPMD risk
stratification, 2) Augment FTIR imaging with histological imaging to improve diagnostic efficiency and accuracy,
3) Apply spatial transcriptomics to profile gene expression and enhance biological interpretability of the OPMD
diagnostic platform. The multimodal imaging-based diagnostic system can be easily integrated into the existing
clinical diagnostic workflow for precise OPMD diagnosis, which together with effective OPMD management can
lead to significantly improved patient outcomes and alleviate the global burden of oral cancer."
11102403,"PROGRAM SUMMARY
The objective of our LAUNCH program is to continue our global health research training program
called the Global Health Equity Scholars (GHES) designed to create a new community of
researchers, educators, and professionals who are prepared to address new and emerging global
health challenges. We will build on the last nine years of this training program to create a cadre of
new researchers who will dedicate their research careers to address the health problems that arise
out of the inequity of human conditions prevalent in informal human settlements (slums). Rather
than addressing one disease at a time, we propose to provide a comprehensive, multidisciplinary,
and integrated approach to deal with urban and rural informal human settlement health issues,
developed over many years by the participating faculty members of this program. This program
will comprise four US partner institutions (Consortium)--Yale University, Stanford University,
University of Arizona, and University of California at Berkeley, each led by a leader in global health
research with more than 10 years of collaboration among themselves. Together, core faculty
mentors from these institutions conduct research at 25 institutions in 21 countries, representing
regions of Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Asia, the Pacific, and Eastern
Europe. The GHES program will address a wide range of health research topics including
HIV/AIDs, emerging and high- consequence infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases
(NCD), women's health, environmental health, mental health, interpersonal violence, substance
abuse, injuries, and the interaction of all of these health issues within the framework of slum health.
Training will target US postdoctoral fellows and pre-doctoral students and low and middle-income
country (LMIC) postdoctoral fellows. We plan to recruit 9-10 trainees/year with 60% of them as US
postdoctoral fellows. The trainees will spend 8-12-months at an LMIC site under the supervisionof
the Consortium and their collaborating LMIC mentors. Workshops on global health research
methods, skill development and career development will be conducted both in-person and online.
LMIC trainees will spend 2-3 months at US institutionsto undergo training in methods not provided
at their institutions. All of the trainees will be provided with research and career mentorship
throughout their training and tracked for career development after completion of their GHES-
supported research work. Thus, under this program, we expect the trainees to be exposed to one
important theme in global health research--health equity--through research that deals with health
concerns of vulnerable populations residing in informal human settlements and provide them with
an opportunity to become experts in this new global health discipline. The overall impact of this
training programis, therefore, to create a new cadre of global health researchers and leaders who
address the emerging health issues arising out of ever-expanding informal human settlements of
LMICs."

(from the funded grant application)
Metabolic enzymes in cells rarely function in isolation, Often their activities are coordinated by physical or
covalent association with each other and cellular structures, A consequence of these associations is that
metabolic intermediates do not equilibrate with the cellular milieu and are instead channeled between
enzyme active sites, Despite the widespread recognition that protein-protein interactions are ubiquitous,
the molecular mechanisms of substrate channeling remain obscure, and the impact of channeling at the
cellular and organismal levels is largely unknown, We seek to narrow these knowledge gaps by exploring
substrate channeling within and between the enzymes of praline catabolism, The proposed experiments
will explore long-distance, allosteric communication between the active sites of the bifunctional enzyme
PutA using kinetic crystallography, assess the contributions of substrate channeling to bacterial fitness and
pathogenesis, and determine the first structure of a novel bifunctional enzyme that moonlights as a
transcriptional repressor using cryo-EM."

This supplement aims to support Hewlett Pham for two years prior to medical school matriculation to help him
build a strong foundation grounded in clinical research and achieve his career goals of attending medical
school and becoming an independent researcher. This research fellowship will provide Hewlett with an
opportunity to develop his cognitive skills to implement a care bundle with evidence-based care components,
technical skills to analyze clinical data, interpret results, educate providers and patients; and additional
research skills including implementation science and biostatistics.
Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD) have led to worse patient health
outcomes and a heavy economic burden on hospital healthcare systems. Overall, the effectiveness of COPD
discharge care bundles has been found to reduce hospital readmission rates; however, other health care
outcomes results such as mortality rates and quality of life have been variable due to a lack of standardized
bundle components and implementation. This emphasizes the need for high-quality studies to identify and
implement the most evidence-based components of a COPD discharge care bundle to improve patient health
outcomes. Hewlett’s research project fulfills this need and will investigate the impact of COPD discharge care
bundles in a large healthcare system setting. Specific Aim 1 of the supplement will identify evidence-based
components for an effective COPD discharge care bundle. Specific Aim 2 will develop a COPD discharge
bundle with frontline providers and patients using PDSA cycles. Specific Aim 3 will pilot the developed COPD
Discharge care bundle on hospital readmissions using an interrupted time series design. This research topic is
within the scope of the parent grant, which focuses on improving the care delivery for individuals with COPD,
specifically, it evaluates the benefit of a pulmonary rehabilitation program on improving COPD health
outcomes. This supplement will have the added benefit of increasing awareness and referral rates to
pulmonary rehabilitation by integrating this guideline recommendation into the COPD discharge care bundle."

Psychosocial stress has been repeatedly associated with immune dysregulation and increased risk for
coronary heart disease (CHD), but the mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Our parent
grant (R01HL163031) investigates this relationship by focusing on DNA methylation (DNAm), one of the critical
epigenetic mechanisms and a proposed key link between environmental exposures and human health. Using
multi-ancestry human cohorts participating in the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed)
program, we identify stress-associated DNAm sites predictive of incident CHD. Employing human cell models,
we further investigate the mechanistic role of these sites in immune cell function. The proposed research
supplement seeks to expand this line of research by further investigating the relationship between
discrimination stress and CHD, specifically in minoritized individuals, a population group that is subjected to a
higher stress burden and is disproportionately affected by CHD. Leveraging the Jackson Heart Study, a cohort
of African American or Black individuals with a wealth of longitudinal phenotypic and DNAm data, this project
aims to investigate how stress in minoritized and disadvantaged populations influences the perpetuation of
CHD disparities by pursuing two distinct but complementary specific aims: 1) Identify the genomic site-specific
DNAm signatures associated with discrimination stress and CHD in Black individuals; and 2) mechanistically
dissect how stress-driven DNAm signatures become established and shape immune cell function relevant to
CHD in diverse donors. These aims will expand the scope of prior work examining cohorts of primarily
European ancestry to include individuals with more diverse backgrounds and will also illuminate the
relationship between discrimination stress and CHD outcomes. Dissecting the epigenetic mechanisms linking
psychosocial stress with disease risk can create opportunities for novel predictive models and therapeutic
targets to enhance personalized CHD prevention and treatment in high-risk minoritized populations."

 Women living with HIV (WLWH) in Vietnam face multifaceted vulnerabilities where HIV stigma and gender
disparities intersect with challenges stemming from a patriarchal, family-oriented culture. Leveraging evidence-
based interventions to address these critical gaps in healthcare for WLWH is crucial. This proposed
supplement, titled “Enhancing Family-Centered Interventions for Women with HIV/AIDS in Vietnam Through
Implementation Science” involves mentored implementation science research aimed at identifying and
adapting evidence-based, family-centered interventions tailored to the cultural and societal context, as well as
the specific needs of WLWH in Vietnam. This administrative supplement proposal builds upon our current
Cutting-edge, Customized, and Comprehensive (CCC) HIV Capacity Building Program for Vietnam and
Thailand (D43TW012489; 2024-2028), a collaboration among University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA),
Hanoi Medical University (HMU), and Chiang Mai University (CMU). Junior faculties/researchers at HMU who
possess enthusiastic research interests in implementation science and women’s health (Dr. Dinh Thanh Thuy
and Mr. Giang Trường Nguyễn) will serve as Co-Investigators of this mentored research. The supplement is
structured around three components with corresponding aims: 1) identifying existing family-centered
interventions for WLWH through a comprehensive scoping review and systematic evaluation by a Community
Advisory Board using the Hexagon Tool; 2) investigating the features and attributes of evidence-based
interventions that influence their acceptability among WLWH and their partners through conjoint analysis; and
3) adapting the most promising interventions for local health systems using World Café discussions to ensure
cultural congruence. This research initiative will yield crucial insights into evidence-based strategies that
empower WLWH and their families in Vietnam, enhancing their engagement with healthcare services and
improving health outcomes. Additionally, the project will significantly strengthen local research capacity by
providing practical, hands-on training in implementation science theoretical frameworks and methodologies to
junior researchers and graduate students at HMU. This training will equip them to lead future health
interventions and research, thereby enhancing the quality of healthcare provision for WLWH in Vietnam and
potentially in other similar contexts globally."

Since its inception in 2012, the UJMT Fogarty Global Health Fellows Program—led by the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, Johns Hopkins University, Morehouse School of Medicine, and Tulane University—has
provided a critical pathway to global health research careers. Our 252 trainees have collectively secured $88.5
million in grant funding, a nearly 600% return on the NIH’s investment. During the current grant cycle (2017-
present), our 110 doctoral scholars and postdoctoral fellows have published a collective 287 manuscripts,
including 109 as primary author. The vast majority remain involved in global health research and many have
already obtained independent grant funding. In the coming grant cycle (2022-2027), under the new LAUNCH
initiative, we build upon these strengths to further improve and expand our program. First, we will provide
enriching 12-month mentored training opportunities at affiliated research sites in 16 countries. We draw upon a
talented pool of US and international candidates, jointly recruited from 12 domestic and 17 international training
programs funded by the NIH. Our expert mentors support experiential learning on site, while the program
provides a central training framework that monitors progress through individual development plans, core skills
checklists, and regular group check-ins. Over the course of the five-year award, we expect to support at least 60
positions via base funding; in line with the RFA, 60% will be US postdoctoral fellows. Second, we will continue
to foster research in scientific areas identified by in-country stakeholders. This includes topics described in the
RFA (e.g., HIV/AIDS, non-communicable diseases, cancers, mental health, neurologic disorders), as well as
other longstanding priorities within our host countries (e.g., infectious diseases, women’s health, child health,
environmental health). Third, we will enhance our training curriculum. We have developed a new Research
Leadership Academy for Global Health, building upon our team’s experience in global health and leadership,
institutional resources, and collaborations with other US government programs. We also provide individually
guided research methodology training and scientific writing support, using proven approaches. Fourth, we will
increase the participation of underrepresented groups in global health research, by identifying and addressing
barriers, emphasizing diversity in recruitment efforts, fostering diversity during the fellowship year, and
supporting a pipeline of future candidates. Fifth, we will monitor, evaluate, and learn from our activities to
iteratively improve the quality of our trainee experience. We utilize a conceptual framework that considers both
process and performance to ensure that the specific aims of the program are met. Finally, the UJMT LAUNCH
initiative will be led by a team of committed global health researchers—and a broad network of engaged
collaborators, both in the US and abroad—with the expertise and experience to carry out its ambitious aims.
Through this program, we will train a diverse group of productive, independently funded, research leaders who
are prepared to tackle the most pressing global health issues in the years to come."
11100594,"Project Summary
Premenopausal females have blood pressure that is ~10mmHg lower than that of males. We previously
reported that an evolutionarily conserved olfactory receptor, OLFR558, is expressed in the kidney. We have
now found that sex differences in blood pressure are absent in Olfr558 knockout (KO) mice, primarily due to
increased blood pressure in females, along with a decreased diastolic pressure in males. In Aim 1, we will
determine which OLFR558-expressing cell types are primarily responsible for the blood pressure phenotype in
males and females. OLFR558 is expressed both in the vasculature and in the renal afferent arteriole (where
renin is stored and secreted from); thus, we will examine both renin levels and vascular responses in male and
female whole-animal KO mice. In addition, we will examine these same parameters, along with blood pressure
by telemetry, in mice with tissue-specific Olfr558 rescue only in the vasculature, or, only in renin-expressing
cells. In Aim 2, we will use gonadectomy in wild-type and KO mice to test the hypothesis that OLFR558 relies
on gonadal signals to mediate sex differences. In parallel experiments we will use the four core genotype
model, in which gonadal and chromosomal sex are separately inherited, to further interrogate this hypothesis.
Finally, it is well-established that males have a higher incidence of hypertension than premenopausal females;
this is true both in humans, and, in animal models of hypertension. In Aim 3, we will examine how OLFR558
influences sex differences in hypertension using two different hypertension models (Angiotensin II infusion,
and, DOCA/Salt). In sum, these studies will reveal key insights into the function of an evolutionarily conserved
OR which is required for sex differences in blood pressure."

Bottom-up, high-throughput prototyping of extracellular vesicle mimetics using cell-free synthetic biology
Cells secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that function as primary messengers of intercellular communication
and are studied as promising drug-delivery vehicles and therapeutics. However, the clinical application of native
EVs has been hindered by their low production yield, impurity, and inherent heterogeneity. Native EVs contain
many biologically active components, such as RNAs and proteins, spread out over numerous subpopulations.
This biological complexity is both the strength and the Achilles’ heel of native EVs. While various features of this
complexity enable the beneficial therapeutic effects of EVs, it is not clear which plays a dominant role. However,
the complex set of proteins and RNAs results in heterogeneous EVs that are challenging to study and use as a
standardized treatment. Therefore, separating out and defining the critical biomolecular features from the overall
heterogeneous set will allow us to perform quality control of EVs and to reproducibly produce or study EVs. A
major bottleneck in finding the critical molecular parts of EVs is the lack of high-throughput methods. To
overcome this difficulty, our team will create a synthetic biology-based, cell-free high-throughput discovery
platform. The platform will be able to synthesize EV mimetics using a cell-free synthesis approach (Aim 1),
coupled with high-throughput examination of EV mimetic potency in vitro (Aim 2). Select EV mimetics will also
be investigated using an in vivo model system of neuroprotection and immune modulation (Aim 3). Throughout
the study, we will use native mesenchymal stem/stromal cell EVs and neurological diseases as our model system
to evaluate the platform. Our work will enable the high-throughput study of EVs for any disease and biological
questions of interest. In addition, we will unveil new insights into EVs that address key debated topics in the EV
field."
11101232,"Progressive weight loss also known as cancer cachexia, afflicts ~85% of patients with pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Cachexia associates with treatment toxicity, morbidity, and mortality, contributing to
the 91% 5-year mortality among patients with PDAC. Moreover, while most patients with PDAC die with
cachexia, we posit that many or most die of cachexia. Currently there are no approved treatments for cachexia,
although pre-clinical studies demonstrate that preserving fat and muscle can prolong function and life with and
without chemotherapy. Here we show a novel pathway linking tumor, adipose, and muscle. We show that
PDAC tumors express Interleukin-6 (IL-6), which circulates to fat, causing local inflammation and further
secretion of IL-6. IL-6 also circulates to muscle, inducing feed-forward production of IL-6 and shedding of the
IL-6 receptor (sIL6R). Muscle-derived IL6R circulates to fat, initiating trans-signaling and adipocyte lipolysis.
Products of lipolysis are taken up by skeletal muscle, leading to myosteatosis, lipotoxic stress, and muscle
atrophy. Inhibition of tumor IL-6 reduces adipose wasting and prevents muscle loss, demonstrating a key role
for IL-6 in the PDAC macro-environment. Preliminary data from patients shows IL-6 expression in tumors,
identifies IL-6 as an upstream regulator in blood, demonstrates IL-6 and IL-6R in adipose tissue, and
documents a STAT3/NF-kB gene signature in muscle. However, only a subset of patients showed elevated IL-
6 pathway activation, whereas 85% of patients experience cachexia. This suggests that IL-6-induced
inflammation might be a driver in a subset of patients, potentially linked to tumor production of IL-6. Indeed, our
preliminary data using orthotopic xenografts of human tumors in mice indicates that patient tumors have
differing intrinsic abilities to cause cachexia, which might be related to IL-6 expression from the tumor. Here
we will interrogate human tissue specimens to document the diversity in the cachexia phenotype and to identify
patients with IL-6 pathway activity. As well, we will as use patient-derived orthotopic xenografts in mouse
models to evaluate the intrinsic ability of tumors to cause cachexia and the therapeutic potential of blocking IL-
6 trans-signaling and tissue crosstalk. To do so we will leverage our existing cachexia biorepository and our
lines of PDAC cachexia “avatars”—mice implanted with human tumor fragments.
AIM 1: Interrogate phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity and tumor-tissue crosstalk in biospecimens from
patients with well characterized body composition and pancreatic cancer cachexia.
AIM 2: Evaluate functional heterogeneity in the capacity of individual tumors to cause cachexia
AIM 3: Test the importance of tumor-tissue crosstalk via IL-6 trans-signaling and lipolysis in a pre-clinical
mouse hospital setting."
11101475,"Research Summary:
The May 2018 edition of CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) highlighted the alarming increase
in the number of reported vector-borne disease cases in the United States. Between 2004 and 2016, 491,000
(76%) vector-borne diseases were caused by tick-transmitted agents. One such disease is human babesiosis,
a potentially fatal and rapidly emerging tick-borne illness reported worldwide and endemic in the United States.
Nine species of Babesia distributed into 2 major groups (small and large Babesia) have been linked to infection
in humans. Small Babesia species encompass B. microti, which is responsible for most human cases worldwide
and B. duncani, which causes fulminant infection that leads to severe and often fatal outcome. Despite the
importance of babesiosis in public health, little is known about the biology, pathogenesis, and mechanism of
virulence of Babesia parasites. We found that, unlike other Apicomplexa, B. microti and B. duncani employ a
novel mode of communication with the host involving two mechanisms of protein export, one vesicular-mediated
and another non-vesicular-dependent. The molecular mechanisms underlying vesicular-mediated secretion in
Babesia and the role Babesia-derived vesicles (BDVs) play in parasite-host interactions remain to be elucidated.
We found that BDVs trigger strong immune modulation of host macrophages. Interestingly, our immunization
studies revealed that these vesicles also confer complete protection from subsequent Babesia challenge. The
overarching goal of this application is to unravel the molecular mechanisms by which Babesia spp communicate
with their host and leverage this knowledge to engineer an effective and safe vaccine for human babesiosis. This
goal will be achieved through three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will pursue further cell biological analyses to
elucidate the basic properties of the BDVs that confer immune protection. We will employ sub-fractionation
analyses to isolate vesicle populations based on size and origin, characterize their ability to confer immune
protection, and determine their structural constituents. In Aim 2, we will examine how BDVs elicit cellular and
humoral immune responses to gain insights into the mechanism of BDV-mediated immune protection. In Aim 3,
we will translate the knowledge about the structure, composition and function of BDVs to develop an effective
vaccine for human babesiosis. These studies are novel and are designed to help us better understand how
Babesia parasites that infect humans interact with the host, and to guide the development of new diagnostic
assays and therapies."
11101479,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB) uses regulation of specific translation
error rates – mistranslation – to survive a variety of stressors including antibiotics and the host environment.
Both too high and too low mistranslation rates can be detrimental to the pathogen. However, it is not known how
Mtb regulates translational error. Understanding the regulation of mistranslation by Mtb will allow for the
development of targeted therapies that interfere with Mtb’s tolerance to antibiotics and survival within the host.
The source of adaptive mistranslation in Mtb is the indirect tRNA aminoacylation pathway: used for the cognate
synthesis of aminoacylated glutamine and asparagine tRNAs, and which results in high levels of mischarged
glutamine and asparagine tRNAs. This pathway is present in most pathogens with the exception of Escherichia
coli. Using forward genetics and small molecule screens, we have identified drugs and genetic mutations that
are implicated in Mtb’s regulation of high mistranslation rates. The aminoglycoside kasugamycin (Ksg) can
decrease specific mistranslation rates in Mtb but has very limited anti-microbial activity and has a very high
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against Mtb growth in vitro. When given at subMIC concentrations to
Mtb-infected mice, Ksg can, as a single agent, attenuate Mtb survival; and when given in combination, can
substantially potentiate anti-TB drugs. Similarly, deletion of the 16S rRNA methyltransferase GidB allows
low/moderate levels of mistranslation but prevents runaway catastrophic mistranslation. Both of these
perturbations affect the ribosome. This is intriguing because prior studies on ribosomes had suggested that
ribosomes do not discriminate against mischarged tRNAs. A potential explanation may be that those prior studies
were performed exclusively with ribosomes from E. coli – which, unlike Mtb, doesn’t routinely encounter
mischarged tRNAs. To understand the mechanisms by which the Mtb translational apparatus can discriminate
against mischarged tRNAs we will use biochemical, structural and kinetic approaches. We will solve the structure
of Mtb ribosomes +/- Ksg or +/- GidB-mediated methylation to identify how these ribosomal perturbations affect
ribosomal recognition of, and discrimination of mischarged tRNAs. Using single molecule fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (smFRET), we will identify the steps in the translation cycle in which ribosomes can
proofread against mischarged tRNA-mediated mistranslation. Together, these studies will a) allow mechanistic
insight into an important non-genetic and non-transcriptional mechanism by which Mtb survives diverse
stressors, b) provide greater understanding of Mtb ribosome function and the translation cycle, which is likely to
be substantially different from model organisms, and c) permit the future development of structure- and
biochemical-informed therapies that target Mtb adaptive mistranslation."
11101770,"ABSTRACT
Series of disappointing clinical trial outcomes have ushered the Alzheimer's field (AD) into an era of preventive
interventions. Researchers now recognize that AD is a continuum and that interventions should start in the
pre-symptomatic phase. To that end, transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) is a promising non-
invasive approach, as its mechanisms have been attributed to the brain system that is initially affected by AD
pathology, the norepinephrine locus coeruleus (LC) system. Animal and preliminary studies in patients and
healthy individuals from our group and others demonstrated that tVNS alters locus coeruleus (LC) and nucleus
tractus solitarius (NTS) functioning and enhances memory. This indicates that tVNS targets the site of initial
AD pathology and might have the potential to delay AD-related cognitive impairment. Thus, tVNS could
address an important challenge in the field: non-invasively delaying disease progression prior to onset of
cognitive decline or significant accumulation of pathology. The overarching goal of this proposal is to apply
single and repeated tVNS in pre-symptomatic older individuals with varying degrees of AD pathology, with the
aim to determine the extent of the cognitive effects of tVNS in domains and time, and to relate tVNS outcome
to demographics, neurophysiological properties of the LC and NTS as well as burden of AD biomarkers. Our
accomplishments in optimizing tVNS and sensitive cognitive measures, ultra-high field brainstem imaging and
blood-based biomarkers allow us to examine our central hypothesis: that serial tVNS enhances memory
functioning more than single, and in particular in at-risk individuals, in whom AD pathology burden is low to
moderate and the NTS-LC system is still responsive to stimulation. To that end, 140 pre-symptomatic older
individuals (APOE-E4 enriched) will be enrolled to a double-blind randomized cross-over design of stimulation
versus sham tVNS during 7T imaging and blood sampling. This will be followed by randomized allocation to
repeated tVNS or sham for 2 weeks and a follow-up cognitive assessment after 2 months. The results of this
study will yield important information for future trials assessing tVNS in three important ways: 1) through
investigating which cognitive domains are modulated by tVNS on the short and long-term, important for
monitoring and determining outcome measures, 2) through identifying demographic characteristics, functional
brain and AD-related markers that predict beneficial responses to tVNS, which will be important to identify
trial eligibility (Aim 1 and 2) and 3) understanding biological pathways contributing to RAVANS success to
confirm target engagement, aid in biomarker stratification or enrichment of the population, and which could
serve to monitor progression (Aim 2 and 3). The research proposed is innovative because it aims to define the
target population in whom tVNS can be efficacious, based on the known underlying biological pathways of both
tVNS and AD. Refining the target population is critical as it is expected to inform eligibility criteria of large-
scale randomized clinical trials, which in turn will contribute to their success in delaying disease progression."

can be used to promote wellness, independence, community participation, and quality of

there are few systems that provide practical and coordinated assistance with mobility and
transfer tasks. We are leading an ongoing nationwide survey of individuals with disabilities
(including Veterans) who use assistive technology and a survey of clinical providers of mobility
technology. To date, 759 AT users and 144 providers have completed the survey. The clear
majority of Veterans (n=346, 88.3%) had obtained their mobility device through the VA. Over
80% (n=633, 83.4%) of mobility device users ranked new powered transfer devices as
“important” or “the most important” futuristic invention. Of the clinical providers over 90%
(n=135, 93.8%) ranked new powered transfer devices as “important” or “the most important”
futuristic invention. This study proposes to build upon the AgileLife product for manual
wheelchairs. We have created an initial prototype Powered Personal Transfer System (PPTS)
that demonstrates the potential to allow VwD to transfer with minimal or no assistance from a
caregiver.
Design Objective 1: Design and implement transfer sequence automation system hardware and
software.
Design Objective 2: Further Identify Stakeholder Needs and Refine Design Specifications.
Design Objective 3: Evaluate and upgrade the initial prototype PPTS integrated with custom
seating system on a commercially available Group-2 EPW to determine compliance with
applicable standards for safety and efficacy.
Design Objective 4: Assess the initial prototype PPTS with rehabilitation professionals and
caregivers to gather data on efficacy and usability while transferring a rescue dummy.
Design Objective 5: Assess the initial prototype PPTS with VwD and their caregivers to
gather data on efficacy and usability.
Our general approach will be to conduct research to refine, advance, and test a PPTS with
EPW and compatible seating system to interface with the transfer bed based on study
data gathered through this project. A quality function deployment process22 will be used to
organize and structure user requirements and aid in the management of trade-offs that are
anticipated based on the technical requirements. Potential problems, alternative strategies, and
benchmarks for success anticipated to achieve the aims will be discussed with
VwD and their clinicians/caregivers. The results of the rehabilitation professional evaluation
with the PPTS and the ISO testing will provide data for the revised design criteria and the
basis for further design work. There are always unforeseen circumstances when designing a
device like the PPTS. The greatest barriers that we perceive are: cost of the device,
distribution and market penetration, data collection and sharing within VA environment, reliance
on the AgileLife bed technology. Our target is for the PPTS to ultimately be competitive in price
with the sum of the cost of a hospital bed, commode chair, Group-2 EPW, and powered
lift device; as these are the devices incorporated into the PPTS."

lium that covers the prominences persists at the l, orofacial clefting ensues, as we previously reported in mouse
embryos deficient for PBX transcription factors (TFs). We described that: 1) prominence fusion requires coordi-
nation of two distinct cellular behaviors, apoptosis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), respectively,
in two discrete subpopulations within the l epithelium; 2) these two subpopulations are characterized by different
molecular signatures; and 3) mice deficient for PBX TFs with CL/P lack both of these epithelial subpopulations.
Our preliminary evidence in the mouse indicates that: I) the λ epithelium is heterogeneous and comprises 6 main
cell subpopulations prior to prominence fusion, as demonstrated by single cell RNA sequencing; II) one of the
subpopulations, that we termed “l fusion effectors”, is enriched for genes that have been associated with human
or mouse orofacial clefting, for genes encoding pro-apoptotic factors, and for inhibitors of cell cycle progression;
III) “l fusion effector” cells are located at the tip of the prominences; and IV) the proportion of “l fusion effectors”
is perturbed in compound Pbx1/2 mutant embryos with CL/P compared to controls. Based on these results, we
posit that the “l fusion effector” cluster comprises cells that are prime executors of prominence fusion; is halted
in the cell cycle, a prerequisite for subsequent cellular changes, like apoptosis and EMT, to achieve fusion; and
is quantitatively and/or qualitatively perturbed in mouse models of CL/P. We will test this hypothesis via the
following Specific Aims: 1) Determine the spatiotemporal dynamics of the epithelial “l fusion effector”
subpopulation throughout midface prominence fusion. We will establish whether the “l fusion effector” clus-
ter is transient or if it persists after fusion, as well as track the progenitors and descendants of “l fusion effector”
cells in vivo across space and developmental time. 2) Establish the molecular mechanisms underlying cell
cycle arrest in “l fusion effector” cells during upper lip/primary palate fusion. We will uncover in vivo cell
cycle dynamics of “l fusion effector” cells and assess whether PBX-dependent regulation of cell cycle genes
mediates cell cycle control in this cluster. 3) Determine whether the perturbations of the “λ fusion effector”
cluster in Pbx1/2 mutants are recapitulated in p63- or Bmpr1a-deficient mice with CL/P. We will establish
whether the cellular and transcriptional changes of the l epithelium resulting in CL/P in Pbx1/2 mutants are
recapitulated in all three mouse models, or if they are distinct. This research will lead to discover new genes for
prenatal diagnostics of CL/P and open strategies for CL/P repair through reactivation of developmental programs
that are defective in orofacial clefting. Broadly, this work will foster mechanistic studies testing whether other
fusion processes are mediated by cell cycle arrest."

Phenotypic variability across demographically diverse populations are driven by environmental factors. The
overall goal of this proposal is to deploy data science approaches to drive discovery of associations between
exposures (E) and phenotypes (P) in demographically diverse populations. We lack data science methods to
associate, replicate, and prioritize exposure variables of the exposome (E) in phenotypes (P) and disease
incidence (D), required for the delivery of precision medicine. Observational studies are fraught with 4 unsolved
data science challenges. First, E-based studies are: (1) limited to associating a few hypothesized exposure-
phenotype pairs (E-P) at a time, leading to a fragmented literature of environmental associations. Machine
learning (ML) approaches for feature selection and prediction hold promise, however, (2) most extant E-based
cohorts contain missing data, challenging the use of ML to detect complex E-P associations, Third, (3) biases,
such as confounding and study design influence associations and hinder translation. Fourth, (4) there are few
well-powered data resources that systematically document longitudinal E-P and E-D associations across
massive precision medicine. It is a challenge to systematically associate a number of exposures in multiple
phenotypes and replicate these associations across cohorts. (Aim 1). The “vibration of effects”, or the degree
to which associations change as a function of study design (e.g., analytic method, sample size) and model
choice is a hidden bias in observational studies (Aim 2). Third, an outstanding question is the degree to which
environmental differences lead to health disparities. To address these challenges and gaps, we propose to Aim
1: develop and test machine learning methods to associate multiple environmental exposure indicators with
multiple phenotypes: EP-WAS. We hypothesize that exposures will explain a significant amount of variation in
phenotype in populations and will deposit all data and models in a novel EP-WAS Catalog. Aim 2: Quantitate
how study design influences associations between exposure biomarkers and phenotype. We will scale up,
extend, and test a method called “vibration of effects” (VoE) to measure how study criteria influences the
stability of associations (how reproducible associations are as a function of analytic choice). Aim 3. Leverage
EP-WAS and VoE to disentangle biological, demographic, and environmental influences of phenotypic
disparities in hypercholesterolemia. We will deploy EP-WAS and VoE packaged libraries in the largest cohort
study to partition phenotypic variation across demographic groups in factors for hypercholesterolemia. We will
equip the biomedical community with data science approaches for robust data-driven discovery and
interpretation of exposure-phenotype factors in observational datasets, required for the identification of
environmental health disparities. For the first time, investigators will ascertain the collective role of the
environment in heart disease at scale just in time for the All of Us program."

Spanish-speaking Hispanics/Latinos are the largest and fastest ethnic/racial minority group in the United States
(19%). This group experiences significant disparities in pain treatment and outcomes relative to their English-
speaking and White counterparts. Cultural and linguistic adaption of pain interventions can help minimize these
disparities. Informed by Barrera’s Heuristic Framework for Cultural Adaptations of Clinical Interventions1 and the
National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) Model for developing and testing mind-body
interventions,2 Dr. Giraldo-Santiago will culturally and linguistically adapt a mind-body and walking program
(GetActive-Fitbit tested in parent R01 5R01AT012069-02; PIs Vranceanu and Greenberg) to the unique needs
of Hispanic/Latino adults with chronic pain. Dr. Giraldo-Santiago will conduct this work in MGH Revere Health
Center, an underserved community clinic with a high representation of Hispanic/Latino adults. This diversity
supplement (PA-23-189) will serve 3 main purposes. First, it will increase the reach of the parent grant, which to
date has had very limited participation of Hispanic/Latinos (~2%) due to lack of cultural and linguistic program
adaptation. Second, it will allow us to include Spanish-speaking Latino individuals in our next grant (UG3/UH3),
a fully powered multi-site efficacy clinical trial of the GetActive-Fitbit program. Third, this diversity supplement
will support the career of Dr. Natalia Giraldo-Santiago, a native Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican social work
researcher in training within the Center for Health Outcomes and Interdisciplinary Research at MGH. This
diversity supplement will allow Dr. Giraldo-Santiago to gain expertise in 1) qualitative methods, 2) the application
of cultural adaptation frameworks to mind-body interventions for Hispanic/Latino adults with chronic pain, and 3)
grantsmanship and research dissemination skills under the mentorship of the parent grant MPIs Dr. Greenberg
(primary mentor) with the support of Dr. Vranceanu (co-mentor). At the end of the supplement year, Dr. Giraldo-
Santiago will be ready to submit a K23 to transition to independence."

People who inject drugs (PWID) are at exceedingly high risk of HIV compared to the general population, yet
pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) programs that target them in the U.S. are scarce and accordingly PrEP
uptake in this population remains low. In recent years, substance use services have been scaled up to address
overdose among PWID, however, they remain an underutilized entry point into PrEP. Yet, research has
documented an increase in HIV risk behaviors (e.g., syringe sharing, high injection frequency) with
the rise of illicit fentanyl in the U.S., underscoring the need for increased PrEP use among PWID.
Further, in the last several years, xylazine, an animal tranquilizer, has penetrated the illicit opioid
market in many cities including Baltimore. Xylazine use significantly elevates the risk of experiencing
nonfatal and fatal overdoses among opioid users, as has been documented in Baltimore and
elsewhere. Xylazine use causes skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) among PWID. Many SSTIs
can be resolved through basic wound care (e.g., cleaning and dressing), but if unattended, infections
often escalate to more serious conditions (e.g., infective endocarditis, bacteremia) which can result in
hospitalizations, amputation, or death. The receipt of necessary medical services is often hindered by
persistent barriers to accessing traditional healthcare settings (e.g., cost, transportation, stigma). We
propose adding wound care services to the Check it intervention in order to respond to the increasing
burden of xylazine-associated of SSTIs. The impact of Check it on PrEP uptake and outdoes
outcomes is measured by a longitudinal cohort study (“SCOPE”) of street-recruited PWID (N=500), is
evaluating the impact of Check It on PrEP continuum engagement and overdose outcomes. Housed
in a mobile van, Check It provides pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) delivered by a nurse and
supported by peer navigators, and point-of-care (POC) drug checking using a Fourier Transform
Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) that detects the relative quantity and diversity of substances in a given
sample. We propose adding wound care services to further meet the urgent needs of PWID as well
as promote and engage PWID in accessible, low barrier, PrEP services."

Cells and organisms, from simple to complex, carry the same genetic DNA sequence organized into genes.
Multicellular eukaryotes transcribe and process genes into RNA isoforms through a process called alternative
splicing. Alternative splicing is developmentally and cell-type specifically regulated. It is foundational to how
higher organisms’ genomes are decoded. Yet, critical and fundamental questions regarding its regulation and
the function of its output remain unanswered. For example, circRNA being a ubiquitous product of alternative
splicing was only discovered in 2012, and its regulation and function remains enigmatic. circRNAs’ discovery
revealed a larger critical knowledge gap in the field for “what, how and why” genes are alternatively spliced.
What RNA splice variants are expressed, how splicing is regulated and which spliced RNAs have essential
functions? Answering these questions is critical for predicting which of myriad genetic variants cause disease
and why they do so. Answers will also enable a new generation of digital nucleic acid biomarkers and
diagnostics for disease, drug targets for correcting dysregulated splicing and identification of pathogenic
protein- or non-coding products (respectively) as well as fundamental basic scientific insight into evolution and
function of eukaryotic genomes. The proposed research will couple novel statistical analyses of -omics data by
taking an unbiased approach and including biological features that are understudied or un-annotated.
Predictions will be coupled with incisive experimental validation to reveal new principles of how RNAs,
including circRNAs, are spliced and how they function. This research potentiates significant new discoveries in
why alternative splicing exists and how this understanding can be used for precision medicine."

With the recent revolution in artificial intelligence for molecular design and protein structure
prediction, we were motivated to apply these new tools to address bottlenecks in our research
focusing on retroviral entry, integration, and drug design. Viral entry and receptor usage has
become a major focus with the emergence of new viruses with expanded host and tissue
specificities. Our research focuses on the ability of retroviral Envelopes to select and utilize novel
host cell receptors. In this proposal, we are utilizing new approaches to identify and study two
novel retroviral Env proteins and their host cell receptors. These include the binding of the A5/A9a
Env protein to the host membrane protein SLC35F2 and the identification of the cognate
receptor(s) for the L1 Env. Applying AlphaFold2, Phyre2 and Evolutionary Covariance structure
prediction programs, we have a first generation model for SLC35F2, which serves as the
foundation for a broad number of questions relating to the function of this orphan receptor. The
second area of focus builds on the gammaretroviral Integrase (IN) protein binding to the host BET
proteins. Through our structural studies of both the Murine Leukemia Leukemia (MLV) IN protein
and the host NSD3 protein binding to the ET domain of the Brd3 BET protein, we are now able to
apply our knowledge of the common binding pocket to advance approaches for studies of
alternative binding substrates and small molecule inhibitors. The ET domain of the BET family of
proteins serves as a node for multi-protein assemblies. Understanding the affinity of different
proteins and small molecules to this ET binding pocket can have profound effects of
gammaretroviral pathogenesis as well as gene and oncogene regulation. Using computer-aided
drug discovery approaches, we have identified first-in-class lead compounds targeting the ET
domain. These studies build on our cohesive collaborative research team with expertise in
virology, NMR structural studies, and bioinformatics."
11101480,"Project Summary: Zoonotic viral infections are responsible for the majority of emerging and re-emerging
infectious diseases in humans. The current strategies for controlling vector-borne virus transmission are
insufficient and additional strategies are urgently needed. Our long-term goal is to define and test recombinant
antiviral sensor/effector strategies that broadly inhibit known and emerging viruses to control or prevent vector-
borne and zoonotic viral diseases. The overall objective of this application is to develop Recombinant Enhanced
Antiviral Sensors (REAVRs), which combine virus-sensing domains with effector domains from different antiviral
proteins to create proteins with unique and broadly-acting antiviral activities. Our central hypothesis is that
combining diverse virus-sensing domains with effector domains from other antiviral proteins will make them more
effective and result in increased resistance against diverse viruses. The rationale of this proposed project is that
once this strategy of synthesizing modular, broadly antiviral recombinant proteins is established, they can be
applied to whole organisms that are important vectors for viral diseases. Based on strong preliminary data, the
central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) generate and optimize REAVRs and evaluate
their antiviral effects in cultured cells; 2) identify and characterize dsRNA- and virus-induced promoters in
mosquito cells and in vivo; and 3) generate REAVR-expressing mosquitoes and test their antiviral effects against
arbovirus infections. Under the first aim, we will generate second generation REAVR proteins and test their
antiviral activity against a broad panel of viruses in established reporter, RNA integrity, and congenic cell culture-
based assays. In the second aim, we will use long-read and short-read RNA-seq strategies to generate a
validated, high-resolution analysis of Ae. aegypti transcriptional changes in response to poly(I:C) and virus
challenge and define promoters driving these responses. Under the third aim, we will use the CRISPR/Cas9
gene editing system to site-specifically insert the second generation REAVRs into transgenic mosquitoes under
control of various inducible promoters, including dsRNA-inducible promoters, and determine their effect on
mosquito sensitivity to a panel of arboviruses and virus transmission. The proposed research is significant
because the proposed strategy of enhancing the host immune response has great potential for the better control
of the transmission of zoonotic viruses and unlike current strategies will inhibit multiple different virus families.
This project is innovative because it introduces a novel approach to prevent virus transmission by combining
different antiviral sensing and effector domains, which is predicted to yield proteins with antiviral activities against
many types of viruses. Moreover, the identification of dsRNA-induced promoters will expand our foundational
understanding of arthropod immunology, and increase the repertoire of available mosquito promoters that could
be employed in the generation of transgenic mosquitoes. Taken together, this project is introducing an innovative
strategy for better control of zoonotic viruses that is expected to have a positive impact on the field."

There has been a growth in the number of cancer survivors across all age brackets, but particularly adolescent
and young adults (AYAs) who experience poorer survival relative to pediatric and older cancer survivors.
AYAs, even when cured from their cancer, are at an increased risk of excess morbidity and mortality,
attributable to higher rates of treatment-related health conditions, including subsequent malignancies and
cardiovascular disease. AYAs also have unique survivorship needs and are particularly vulnerable to gaps in
care related to lack of knowledge of late effects, loss to follow up from the primary oncology team, lack of
regular primary care, and the need to navigate critical transitional life milestones. Growing recognition of
survivorship needs has led to the development of standardized, cancer survivor-specific screening and
surveillance guidelines, with the goals of risk reduction, early detection, reduced mortality, and improved
quality of life; it has also led to the establishment of National Standards for Cancer Survivorship Care. Despite
the availability of these guidelines, receipt and overall quality of survivorship care is inconsistent across
survivors and treating facilities, with gaps in our knowledge of survivorship care to meet the unique needs of
AYAs. In response to NOT-CA-24-032, we propose a mixed methods study of AYA cancer survivors (ages 15-
39 years at diagnosis) diagnosed between 2014-2019. In aim 1, we will Identify risk factors for underutilization
of survivorship care in AYA survivors and assess alignment with National Standards for Cancer Survivorship
Care by linking EHR data of AYAs within our cancer registry with an online patient survey to identify what
proportion of survivors have a documented survivorship visit (primary outcome) and identify risk factors and
perceived barriers to receiving survivorship care across patient socio-demographics and health behaviors. In
aim 2, we will conduct focus groups in a subset of AYA survivors who are high and low utilizers of survivorship
care, along with key informant interviews with stakeholders in order to understand the current landscape of
how national survivorship care standards are implemented, to identify factors driving under- versus high
utilization of AYA survivorship care, and to develop priorities for enhanced survivorship care that directly
address patient-driven approaches for reducing barriers. The results of the proposed research have the
potential to inform strategies to optimize AYA survivorship care and its utilization, to identify demographic and
geographic utilization differences, and to inform future survivorship care interventions that promote high-
quality, equitable, and sustainable use of survivorship care among AYA cancer survivors."

Cells are highly dynamic entities that are pulling and pushing on one another and on their surroundings.
Understanding these minuscule forces is the key for unraveling important biological processes. However, a major
challenge in cell biology is the lack of molecular probes to visualize and quantify cellular forces. Here, I propose
to use state-of-the-art DNA nanotechnology to develop next-generation molecular probes and nanodevices to
address important challenges in mechanobiology, an emerging multidisciplinary field that encompasses the study
of mechanisms by which cells sense and respond to mechanical signals. As an expert in DNA nanotechnology,
my lab's research is built upon three pillars: self-assembly complex DNA structures, DNA-directed assembly of
materials and devices, and most importantly, DNA nanodevices for biological and biomedical research and
applications. In recent years, I have published high-impact work in single-molecule mRNA detection, DNA-based
in vivo delivery of therapeutic small molecules and RNA for cancer treatment, and methods for ultra-sensitive
biosensing and bioimaging. In the next five years, I propose to develop novel, state-of-the-art DNA-based
molecular devices/probes for study of T cells and B cells, with special focus on the following directions: (1)
Multivalent DNA force probe nanoarrays for investigating multivalent binding, (2) Multiplexed DNA tension probes
for studying cross-regulation between mechanoreceptors, (3) DNA nanodevices to catch receptor conformation
change under force for Cryo-EM study. The proposed research is built upon our exciting progress on developing
novel DNA-based system for studying mechanobiology in recent years. Noticeably, we developed a DNA origami-
based system for programmable arrangement of TCR and CD4 for studying their cooperative binding, and I also
developed a few new methods to improve DNA tension sensors for mechanobiology study, including the first
DNA-origami-based multivalent tension sensors, super-resolution tension sensors that uses DNA PAINT, ultra-
sensitive tension sensors that employ a DNA-based hairpin chain reaction for signal amplification. My strong
expertise in DNA nanodevices, protein assembly on DNA nanostructures, DNA-based tension sensors, and my
track record of synergy and collaboration, place our lab at an excellent position for proposed research activities.
The tools developed herein are applicable to study of other molecular interactions of T cells and other cells in
the immune system or other biological systems, thereby potentially impacting the broader biomedicine field
where cell surface molecular interactions are being targeted for treatment of various diseases, including
autoimmunity, viral infection, and cancer."
11102595,"Project Summary: The structure, dynamics and function of a biomolecule play a key role in determining
disease mechanisms, knowledge of which is essential for early diagnosis, drug development and effective
treatment. Many biological studies focus on structure determination of biomolecules but the study of dynamics
is vital to understand disease mechanisms, including their function and interaction with their environment.
Compared to other biophysical methods, multi-frequency 2D Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy are
powerful methods for studying structural dynamics of proteins at physiological temperatures for a wide range of
time scales (sub-𝑛𝑠 to tens of 𝜇𝑠) and can provide a detailed description of motion that includes both dynamics
as well as local structural ordering. Despite major advances, multi-frequency 2D-ESR lack sufficient sensitivity
and resolution needed to study biological systems at 𝜇𝑠 timescales, because the signals are heavily dominated by
noise with Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) of unity and so are hardly visible. To address this problem, the
proposed research will develop computational methods based on wavelet transforms to remove noise for
accurate signal recovery. The proposed research is aimed at developing multidimensional wavelet denoising for
multi-frequency 2D-ESR signals at SNR ~ 1, extending the 1D wavelet denoising approach. Wavelet transforms
provide a powerful approach to remove noise as they focus on separating noise from the signal, an active subject
in the field of signal processing. The methods will include multi-dimensional representation of signals,
development of new wavelets, enhancement in signal resolution in the wavelet domain, and development of noise
thresholds based on well-defined statistical theorems, all of which will contribute to separate noise from signals.
A new criterion will also be developed and adopted to quantify noise and uncertainty. The new denoising
methods will be applied to reveal conformational dynamics of a well-characterized T4 Lysozyme protein and to
understand lipid-transmembrane interactions ranging from 𝑛𝑠 to tens of 𝜇𝑠 time scales at physiological
temperatures and concentrations for understanding signaling pathways related to diseases. This will lead to a
detailed understanding of protein dynamics at the time scale of exchange between conformational substates and
will create a platform for which motions of biological complexes can be studied, which currently remains elusive
and are of key functional importance. Measurement of exchange rates under physiological conditions is a new
experimental frontier and lifetimes in the range of 𝜇𝑠 are anticipated. It will also lay the foundation for using
data processing methods to remove noise from experimental signals and permit their application during data
acquisition for real-time processing. Data processing methods are inexpensive, easy-to-implement, and easily
scalable to existing instruments."

 Zinc is an essential nutrient that profoundly affects human health, since ~10% of the proteome binds zinc.
A key to zinc homeostasis is storage during times of excess and release during periods of deficiency.
Lysosomes, which have a well-established role in the degradation of macromolecules, are emerging as a
conserved site of zinc storage. How lysosomes integrate the dual functions of zinc storage and degradation is
not well defined. Our data indicate that lysosomes mediate these dual functions in separate compartments.
 We used C. elegans to demonstrate excess zinc is stored in lysosomes of intestinal cells; CDF-2 (ZnT2 in
mammals) is the SLC30 family transporter that loads zinc into lysosomes, and ZIPT-2.3 is the SLC39 family
transporter that releases zinc. Reciprocal regulation of CDF-2 and ZIPT-2.3 regulates the direction of zinc flow;
in excess zinc, CDF-2 is upregulated to increase storage and ZIPT-2.3 is downregulated to decrease release.
 How do lysosomes rapidly change the composition of transporters on their surface? Using super-resolution
microscopy, we discovered that lysosomes have an expansion compartment connected to the acidified central
compartment. The expansion compartment is contracted in zinc-replete conditions, but grows dramatically in
response to high zinc. Our overall hypothesis is that the expansion compartment allows the rapid delivery of
CDF-2 to lysosomes to promote zinc homeostasis –without disturbing degradative processes in the acidified
compartment. This hypothesis is innovative, since we only observed the expansion compartment with the
recent availability of super-resolution microscopy. To determine if this mechanism is conserved, we examined
lysosome dynamics in mammalian cells; the ZnT2 zinc transporter alters its localization on lysosomes in
response to high zinc, consistent with lysosome remodeling. To test the predictions of our model, we will
characterize the molecular nature of the compartment, identify transcriptional changes during assembly and
disassembly, and validate our findings in mammalian cells.
Specific Aim 1, First, we will use TEM to determine whether lysosomes have a second membrane-bound
compartment that contains CDF-2. Second, we will use X-ray fluorescence microscopy to test whether zinc is
sequestered in this structure.
Specific Aim 2, we will extend these findings to mammalian cells. We will test whether the ZnT2 transporter is
required to store zinc, identify the ZIP protein that releases zinc, and test whether these transporters are
reciprocally regulated to remodel lysosomes.
Specific Aim 3, we will analyze the regulation of lysosome remodeling. We demonstrated that the lysosome
biogenesis regulator HLH-30 (TFEB in mammals) is required for remodeling. We will determine how the
transcriptional response to high zinc mediates lysosome remodeling. These studies will have a major impact by
defining a new aspect of lysosome biology that is critical for zinc homeostasis."

This study is responsive to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) NOT-AT-21-006 “Fundamental Science
Research on Complementary and Integrative Health Approaches, Including Natural Products or Mind and Body
Interventions” objectives to “Develop targeted and untargeted bioinformatic approaches to identify active
components in a natural product mixture.”
Structural elucidation of natural products (NPs) remains a critical rate-limiting step in NP discovery campaigns.
Difficulties in structural elucidation can arise from i) the lack of sufficient quantities of material for traditional
analytical methods (e.g. nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography); ii) intrinsic
physical properties of the NP, and iii) limitations of NMR capabilities in determining relative configuration. X-ray
crystallography remains the gold-standard for unambiguous structural determination, including the assignment
of stereochemistry. However, X-ray crystallographic analysis of newly-isolated NPs is often thwarted by
insufficient quantities to provide crystals large enough for single-crystal diffraction or poor solid-state properties
that preclude the formation of large, pristine crystals even when sufficient material is available. Given these
challenges, we envision that application of the recently reported cryo-electron microscopy (CryoEM) modality
micro-crystal electron diffraction (MicroED) could lead to vertical advances in the field of NP discovery directly
responsive to this NOSI, as MicroED has recently been demonstrated to provide unambiguous structures from
sub-micron-sized crystals of structurally complex chemical compounds that had failed to yield large crystals
suitable for X-ray analysis.
In this proposal, we aim to leverage a CryoEM/MicroED approach to resolving major bottlenecks in the structure
elucidation of (partially) purified NPs and chemically complex NP mixtures. We hypothesize that we can advance
the field of NP research through development and optimization of a high-throughput platform technology to
identify NPs in complex mixtures and yield a novel diffractomics signature of molecules for integration into
bioinformatics approaches. To evaluate this hypothesis, we will carry out three specific aims: 1) Use MicroED to
solve structures of recalcitrant (partially) purified NPs; 2) Develop a high-throughput MicroED-based platform for

all aims, we will leverage a one-of-a-kind and expansive group of three NP collections (chemical libraries of

Without access to a connected and streamlined process for diagnosis, research, and care, many patients with
rare conditions go from one institution to the next without a diagnosis or advancements in their care. In order to
address this problem, infrastructure and protocols to support the diagnostic process and generate knowledge
about underlying disease mechanisms were created as part of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN). The
Administrative Core of the Data Management Coordinating Center (DMCC) for Diagnostic Centers of
Excellence will advance infrastructure developed in the UDN and support novel methods to accelerate
diagnosis, research, and care for patients with undiagnosed conditions. The Administrative Core will be
responsible for uniting both the DMCC and broader Network. Development of partnerships will be crucial to the
Administrative Core in order to scale operations and ensure the Network is sustainable in the future. The
Administrative Core will organize its work around accomplishing the following three specific aims: 1) Drive and
advance DMCC and Network operations by providing scientific leadership and robust infrastructure, 2) Identify
and eliminate barriers to evaluation, diagnosis, research, and follow-up for patients with undiagnosed
conditions, and 3) Initiate and cultivate strategic partnerships and educational initiatives to expand network
impact."

My research aims to understand the role of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin structure in gene regulation. This
involves studying associations among genotype, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, non-coding
RNAs, chromatin interactions and gene expression. In order to transform this genome-wide information into
new biological discoveries, my laboratory develops scalable and interpretable computational methods based
on statistics, graph theory and machine learning. Our recent focus is to address an important gap in the current
knowledge of the role of 3D chromatin structure in gene regulation. That is, we aim to define how genotypic
variation affects 3D organization of gene promoters, and in turn, their expression. To achieve this at a genome-
wide scale is an ambitious goal, because it requires having at a minimum, genotype, gene expression and
chromatin interaction profiles in pure populations of specific cell types from a large number of donors.
However, my laboratory is uniquely positioned to perform this research because: i) we are involved in a study
at the La Jolla Institute (LJI-R24AI108564) that has already genotyped ~100 donors and expression-profiled
more than 15 different pure populations of human immune cell types, and we have access to the same
samples for chromatin interaction mapping, ii) in collaboration with other groups at LJI, we have already
discovered a prototypical example of an interaction quantitative trait locus (iQTL) that alters and rewires
interactions from the promoter of a specific gene that is associated with asthma susceptibility, iii) we have the
necessary expertise and proven track record in experimental design and computational analyses of various
chromatin conformation capture assays. Leveraging the resources available at LJI and our expertise in the
field, we will build a unique research program around the novel concept of iQTLs. The emerging set of three
main questions we propose to address within the next five years are: Q1) How do we define cell-type-specific
iQTLs for common genetic variants? Q2) What is the extent of overlap between iQTLs and GWAS SNPs? Q3)
Can we build predictive models for the cell-type specificity of chromatin interactions and iQTLs? Although we
propose to define iQTLs only in two abundant, easily accessible, and highly disease-relevant immune cell
types, the concept of iQTLs is equally important in other cell types implicated in diseases with a genetic
component. Hence, the proof-of-concept developed by this work, without a doubt, will open up a new field in
studying a previously uncharacterized role for disease-susceptibility variants, specifically non-coding SNPs,
from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in gene regulation."
10848052,"ABSTRACT: LEADERSHIP, PLANNING, AND EVALUATION
Leadership, Planning, and Evaluation efforts of the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center (SKCC) focus on developing
a comprehensive, inclusive system to engage Consortium Institutional Leaders, Senior Leadership, Members,
community advocates, staff, patients, and caregivers in pursuit of the SKCC mission. This effort includes well-tested
and integrated mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and adjust the Center's Program activities, Shared
Resource services, funding allocations, and strategic directions. Planning and Evaluation ensures that future
directions are achievable, and that resources and investments are targeted effectively while providing the ability
to respond to new opportunities. SKCC's Planning and Evaluation process is highly integrated with institutional
planning and resource allocation activities across the consortium to ensure alignment and ability to capitalize on
institutional investments. Once formally appointed as Center Director, Dr. Chapman immediately identified the
development of a new five-year strategic plan, IMPACT PHL, as one of his first priorities. Consistent with his
management style, he created a transparent and inclusive planning process with high engagement throughout
the consortium including members, university and health system leaders, and other stakeholders including the
Community Advisory Board. This process was developed to augment a change of culture and effectively define
the SKCC's vision, creating a mechanism to guide decisions, assess progress, and make changes to ensure
success. The plan was completed within 6 months of his appointment and has shaped leadership investments,
recruitments, and consortium initiatives. Significant progress has already been made. In addition, the Research
Executive Cabinet (REC), comprised of senior leadership, conducts intensive annual Program and Shared
Resource reviews, through which they assess progress against goals, and cancer relevance relative to
catchment area needs. REC serves to: 1) ensure the Center Director's vision by overseeing implementation of
strategic processes that ensure effective resource allocation, development and management of Programs,
Shared Resources, and other components; 2) foster a collaborative scientific environment that facilitates high-impact
research and clinical care; 3) enable a focus on cancer problems applicable to the catchment area; and
4) develop effective training and educational programs for basic, clinical, and population researchers that
prioritize the development of a diverse and inclusive workforce. Planning and Evaluation processes serve to: 1)
develop and oversee action plans that align with the SKCC vision to achieve Center goals; 2) implement well-organized
internal, external, and institutional planning and evaluation processes that engage leaders, members,
and advisors and enable the Center to achieve goals; and 3) provide ongoing mechanisms to monitor, evaluate,
and improve Programs, Shared Resources, Developmental Funds, clinical research resources, new initiatives,
funding priorities and allocations, and strategic directions to ensure alignment with the Center's vision and goals."
10882644,"ABSTRACT Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a leading cause of congenital birth defects. The most
common sequela observed in symptomatic infants is sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). SNHL is also
observed, somewhat perplexingly, during early childhood, developing over a period of years in children
born hearing competent and asymptomatic for infection at birth. The most abundant peripheral nervous
system (PNS) myelin protein, myelin protein zero (MPZ), is largely responsible for compaction of the
PNS myelin sheath. Charcot-Marie-Tooth Type 1B and Dejerine-Sottas syndromes patients, with
mutations in MPZ, frequently suffer from late-onset SNHL, similar to that observed in HCMV
congenitally-infected children. MPZ expression is dramatically decreased in congenital HCMV-infected
tissue samples. Schwarm cells (SCs) are the only cells in the body that produce MPZ. HCMV infection of
SCs, or sole expression of the HCMV tegument protein pp71 in culture, causes large decreases in MPZ
mRNA levels. SCs express MPZ protein only when directly contacting the neurons they sheathe, making a
tractable co-culture system essential to studying defects in myelination. Substantial literature describes
rat SC/neuron co-culture; however, very little work has reported using only human cells, essential for the
study of species-restricted Human CMV pathogenesis. We have developed an all-human threedimensional
(3D) SC/neuron co-culture system, amenable to the study of HCMV interactions. Our
preliminary experiments have produced robust neurite outgrowth, SC/neuron interactions, MPZ
expression and myelination. Initial experiments with pp71-expressing SCs produced very different
interactions between the cell types and no evidence of myelination. In this application, we propose three
AIMS. AIM 1 will fully characterize the co-culture system, establishing the baseline parameters of
outgrowth and myelination, additionally assessing the functionality of the system using nerve conduction
velocity studies, over a 30-day timecourse using wildtype SCs. After defining the co-culture system's
baseline parameters, AIM 2 will assess the ramifications of HCMV infection and pp71 expression on all
parameters defined in AIM 1. AIM 3 will utilize the co-culture system to examine crosstalk between the
extracellular matrix (ECM) and myelin production, MPZ in particular, since the literature suggests a
critical link between the ECM and SCs' ability to properly myelinate neurons. We believe this 3D system
will enable us to accurately assess the effects ofHCMV infection on the developing PNS. Moreover, we
believe our new system has the potential to be utilized by the wider scientific community studying
interactions between glia and neurons and associated defects in myelination with an eye on its utilization
as an efficient platform for drug discovery and development."

11112115,"Abstract
Our brains have evolved to extract relevant sensory information from rich and complex natural environments in
order to drive appropriate behavior. Multiple brain structures can play a role in such processing, and while
cortex is often most prominent in mammalian studies, many behaviors can also be mediated by superior
colliculus, particular orienting and avoidance responses to salient stimuli. However, the relative roles of cortex
and superior colliculus, and the interactions between them, are poorly understood as the two are not typically
studied together, particularly within a natural behavior context. Here we will use prey capture in the mouse as
an ethological paradigm to study the computations performed by cortex, and their impact on SC, across two
sensory modalities - visual and auditory. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that cortex is
necessary under conditions that require flexible identification of stimuli in complex sensory environments,
whereas SC serves as a specific feature detector in simple conditions. We further hypothesize that in both
cases, SC serves as the effector to orient towards prey, with cortex mediating its role in complex environments
via top-down modulation of SC.
In order to test potential mechanisms, we will first determine the role of cortex in different aspects of sensory
processing, by inactivating primary sensory cortex (V1 or A1) during prey capture, under conditions where we
vary the task complexity from isolated stimuli to complex sensory environments. We will next determine the
information encoded in cortex and SC during these different conditions via extracellular multisite recordings
during both prey capture behavior and head-fixed passive presentation of stimuli. Finally, we will determine the
interaction between cortex and SC by measuring the impact of inactivating cortico-collicular projections on
neural coding in SC. All these experiments will be performed in both visual and auditory domains in order to
determine shared principles that may serve as canonical computations in the cortico-collicular system.
Furthermore, this project builds on the complementary expertise in these domains of co-PIs Niell (visual
physiology) and Wehr (auditory physiology), who have an established history of collaboration including
developing the prey capture paradigm previously."
11138141,"The work proposed in Project 1 is based on the observation that one can design short Catalytic AMyloid-
forming Peptides (CAMPs) to catalyze chemical reactions with high efficiency in addition to their own self-
assembly. The goals of the proposed work are: 1. to understand the structural and mechanistic basis for the very
high activity of CAMPs; 2. to achieve improved catalytic efficiency and substrate selectivity in CAMPs; 3. to
create amyloid-organic frameworks, a new class of catalytic materials; 4. to develop complex multifunctional,
light-driven and regulated CAMPs with tunable properties for synthesis of complex products. Development and
characterization of catalytic amyloids will advance several fields of biomedical importance. It will set important
structural and functional reference points for the broad community of scientists interested in the role of amyloids
in protein folding, catalysis and health The structure-activity relationships and structural insights generated in the
proposed work will help us better understand the mechanisms of amyloid toxicity and will improve our knowledge
of the structures adopted by more complex amyloid-forming proteins. In addition to its practical value, this
research program will have a profound impact on our understanding of the fundamental aspects of catalysis.
 Project 2 aims to develop a new NMR-based experimental approach to guide directed evolution to fully
realize its potential in repurposing enzymes for new functions. Specifically we will: 1. gain a thorough
understanding of the limits and the applicability of the method; 2. Independently validate the approach in different
protein scaffolds; 3. use NMR guided directed evolution to create high efficient and selective catalysts for
practically important chemical transformations.
 Project 3. The ability of pathogens to neutralize drugs via a newly developed catalytic activity is one of
the mechanisms of drug resistance. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the factors that determine the ability
of proteins to catalyze new chemical transformations is of paramount importance. We aim to determine the
factors that guide evolution of protein function at a molecular level and use these principles to create catalysts
for chemical transformations not found in nature. We will combine a minimalist computational approach with
sophisticated protein engineering tools to create new protein catalysts for a number of different chemical
transformations including those that require metal cofactors."
11100598,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Changes in physiological stimuli reprogram the translation machinery to alter preferential recruitment of
mRNAs to the ribosome and which start site on a mRNA is selected. Genome wide analysis using
ribosome profiling has revealed far more extensive regulation of these events than previously appreciated,
yet the mechanism of mRNA recruitment and its regulation remains poorly understood. This knowledge
gap persists mainly because of difficulties in determining which intermediate step(s) in the initiation
pathway function as kinetic checkpoints to control mRNA recruitment. To date, initiation pathway
intermediates have largely been identified on the basis of their thermodynamic stability which must
withstand traditional assays (e.g. sucrose gradients and immunoprecipitations). These approaches take
minutes to hours to perform, and/or require cross-linking agents to stabilize them, but most intermediates
prior to initiation codon selection occur on the sub-second to second time scale. To determine how
mRNAs are selected for translation, one must develop and use assays that can precisely monitor the
formation of pathway intermediates in real-time. To overcome this bottleneck and move the field forward,
we have developed innovative ensemble and single-molecule fluorescence-based assays that can
monitor the rate of mRNA recruitment to the ribosome in real-time. Our highly purified reconstituted
system will enable us to successfully test and build models with which to understand mRNA recruitment
and its regulation. Models that we generate will be tested using translation assays in cell-free extracts and
intact cells. Our long-term objective is to understand the mechanism by which alterations in initiation factor
availability and their post-translational modification reprograms the translational apparatus to control
which mRNAs are translated in response to physiological stimuli."
11100957,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Across many species, the evolutionary processes that underlie genetic variation are structured by the
geographical distribution of individuals and how geography impacts patterns of reproduction and dispersal.
In human genetics, geographic patterning in allele frequencies has important practical consequences for
genome-wide association studies, as it can produce a type of confounding with other spatially varying factors
impacting traits. It also has relevance for the discovery of rare loss-of-function variant carriers. In infectious
disease, the arrival and spread of novel adaptive variants is mediated by geographic dispersal patterns.
 In this project, we will develop theory, methods, and resources that incorporate an explicitly geographic
component. In the first research area, we will develop new theoretical models for investigating the impacts
of varying spatial sampling strategies on the detection of deleterious alleles, such as loss-of-function alleles.
We will also study the spread of advantageous alleles in populations with super-spreaders and long-distance
dispersal, as well as graph-based dispersal dynamics, in a series of analyses that is relevant for
understanding the spread of adaptive variants in human-dispersed pathogens. In the second research area,
we will expand a set of methods for understanding spatial structure in genetic data. Specifically, we hope to
build models that more accurately capture directional and long-distance migration. In the third research area,
we will continue to maintain and develop resources for visualizing geographic distributions in allele
frequencies. These three research areas are synergistic and ideally will help advance our understanding of
genetic variation in numerous species, including humans."

Migraine is a common, painful and highly disabling disorder. Depressive symptoms are common in people with
migraine and are associated with increased suffering. Despite the significant emotional, social, and economic
burden of this comorbidity, no existing treatment adequately addresses both migraine disability and elevated
depressive symptoms. Development of scalable and integrative treatments that address both migraine disability
and comorbid depressive symptoms has been identified as a major gap in migraine treatment. Mindfulness-Based
Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is an evidence-based and standardized treatment that is an excellent candidate for
reducing disability and depressive symptoms in people with migraine. Our preliminary data show that MBCT
reduced migraine-related disability; however, during exit interviews, participants noted the burden of attending 8
weekly in-person sessions was a substantial barrier to accessing care. Our preliminary data suggest an abbreviated
and telephone-delivered MBCT (MBCT-T) protocol is a feasible alternative to in-person treatment. However, video-
based delivery (MBCT-V) may improve patient engagement. This project aims to prepare for a definitive multi-site
Phase III trial of remote-delivered MBCT-T or MBCT-V or both in patients with migraine and depressive symptoms.
During Study 1, we will use guidelines from the NIH’s Behavioral Change Consortium to optimize fidelity MBCT-T
and MBCT-V for patients with migraine (as defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders – 3)
and depressive symptoms (as defined by empirical cut-offs on the Patient Health Questionnaire – 9). Products
developed during Aim 1 will be: training protocols, facilitator treatment manuals, fidelity checklists, MBCT-T/V
Adherence and Competence Scales, fidelity coding manuals. Products will be iteratively optimized using
quantitative and qualitative fidelity metrics assessed at the patient-level (comprehension) and facilitator-level
(corrective feedback, intervention delivery) in three iterations following: 1) pilot MBCT-T and MBCT-V groups led by
a certified MBCT facilitator at a site in New York, NY; 2) 35-hour training for facilitators across two additional sites in
the Bronx, NY and Winston-Salem, NC; and 3) pilot MBCT-T and MBCT-V groups at the two additional sites.
During Study 2, we will conduct a multi-site pilot RCT (n=144) of MBCT-T, MBCT-V, and Enhanced Usual Care
(EUC). We will evaluate fidelity, feasibility, and acceptability of each arm across three sites in patients with migraine
and depressive symptoms. Pre-specified decision rules for fidelity, feasibility, acceptability, and clinical utility will
determine the arms of the future phase III trial evaluating remotely delivered MBCT for migraine disability and
depressive symptoms."

Several studies have found that infection with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 diagnosis are associated with the
development and progression of both Type 1 (T1D) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), possibly through infection of
beta cells, increased insulin resistance, increased inflammation and fibrosis, and other biological processes.
The proposed study will take advantage of robust existing infrastructure to rapidly identify, recruit, and retain
diverse cohorts of English and Spanish speaking pediatric and adult patients with recently diagnosed T1D or
T2D. The study will include 1600 study participants diagnosed with diabetes in the last 3 months, who have
had a known COVID-19 infection in the past 90 days and those with recent diagnosis of diabetes and no
known COVID-19 infection in the past year. The study will leverage PCORnet, a unique national network of
over 60 health systems with electronic health record (EHR) data on over 80 million patients and a track record
for successful study recruitment. We will query EHR records to swiftly identify potential study subjects with
recent diagnosis of diabetes and contact them via patient portals, telephone, face-to-face encounters, and
other approaches. We will also leverage the T1D Exchange (T1DX), a national network of 54 diabetes centers
and an online patient registry of 17,000 individuals with T1D. Consented participants will partake in regular
web/mobile or telephone surveys leveraging a previously developed REDCap/Twilio platform. Participants will
also come to sites for regular serological testing, and a subsample will participate in more robust testing of
glucose tolerance, biomarkers, and vascular function. This data will be supplemented by longitudinal EHR data
from participating sites and across PCORnet. Participants will be followed for 2 years. Aim 1 will examine if
patients with recent T2D who have recent COVID-19 are more likely to have worse glycemic control, increased
inflammation and increased insulin resistance than patients without recent COVID-19. Aim 2 will examine if
patients with recent T1D who have recent COVID-19 are more likely to have worse glycemic control, increased
inflammation and more rapid reduction in beta cell function than patients without recent COVID-19. Aim 3 will
evaluate a subset of patients with diabetes to examine if COVID-19 is associated with worse vascular function,
increased inflammation and hypercoagulability. Aim 4 will explore the role of genomic/social/environmental
factors on inflammation and metabolic function. Aim 5 will leverage EHR data to explore the role of COVID-19
and COVID-19 treatments on diabetes development and diabetes-related outcomes across the pandemic. The
study will be led by a team with significant experience related to COVID-19, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19
(PASC), obesity and diabetes in children and adults, epidemiological research, informatics, health services
research, genomics, metabolomics, physiology, patient and family engagement and other areas. The proposed
work will provide a deeper understanding of the relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes, that can support
future interventions and public health approaches to improve health."
11111767,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN or neutrophil) maintain human health by rapidly eliminating the invading
pathogens. These circulating cells transmigrate across the endothelial adherens junctions (AJs) to enter into the
infected tissue and to clear the pathogens. Little is known about the role of mechanical forces which PMN
experience during transmigration across the endothelium. Our Supporting Data describe the potentially
important role of adherens junctions in activating PMN’s host defense function. We observed that activation of
PMN-expressed Piezo1 during paracellular transmutation induced calcium influx, which in turn, promptly
stabilized Hif1α and upregulated expression of NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) in PMN to program these cells to
efficient “killers” of the pathogens. These findings have for the first time linked PMN-expressed Piezo1 to the
host-defense function, leading to the fundamental question “how Ca2+ influx in PMN via Piezo1 program the
host-defense function of PMN?” In Aim 1, we will determine the role of PMN-expressed Piezo1 signaling
pathway in activating the host-defense function of transmigrating PMN. Here we will delineate the signaling
pathways downstream of Piezo1 activation that promptly stabilizes Hif1α in PMN and programs PMN to become
more efficient bacterial “killers”. The studies will involve genetic analysis of Piezo1- Hif1α signaling of the
transmigrating PMN such as PMN-specific Piezo1 and Hif1α knockout mice. We will also determine whether
pharmacological activation of Piezo1 or expression of gain-of-function Piezo1 mutant in PMN is sufficient to
activate the PNM defense system in the relevant P. aeruginosa-induced pneumonia model. In Aim 2, we will
determine the role of PMN-expressed Nox4 in regulating oxidative and lytic properties of PMN and in the
efficient elimination of pathogens in lung. These studies will address the function of Nox4 in PMN in the
mechanism of innate immune defense program. Using in vitro and in vivo experiments, we will determine how
Hif1α induces activation of Nox4 gene and how Nox4 regulates oxidative and lytic properties of phagolysosome
and efficient pathogen killing. The proposed studies will be essential for understanding the regulation of PMN
host-defense function with the goal of identifying therapeutic potential of Piezo1 activators."

Intersectional stigma based on race, sexual orientation, and HIV-status reduces antiretroviral therapy (ART)
adherence among Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) and live with HIV (LWH), a group heavily affected
by the HIV epidemic in the US. Low ART adherence is associated with a higher risk of virological failure as well
as morbidity, mortality, and HIV transmission to HIV-negative partners. Evidence-based interventions (EBIs) for
BMSM/LWH to address the ART adherence barriers due to intersectional stigma are still lacking. Phone-based
reminder systems like ARemind can increase ART adherence with a medium/high effect size, but their effect on
viral suppression remains poorly understood. Reminder-based interventions address sporadic non-adherence
or single missed ART doses due to forgetfulness that has minimal impact on viral suppression. They do not
address sustained non-adherence resulting from social and structural factors including intersectional stigma.
Sustained non-adherence is a risk factor for virological failure. Sporadic and sustained non-adherence worsens
HIV-induced chronic inflammation (e.g., high interleukin[IL]-6 levels), thereby increasing morbidity and mortality
risk. The candidate seeks training and research experience to desi
gn and pilot test a technology-enhanced,
culturally-sensitive EBI for BMSM/LWH to address sporadic and sustained non-adherence.
Through this K01
Award, he will accomplish the following Training Goals (TGs): TG1. To develop skills in behavioral intervention
research; TG2. To gain skills in qualitative research methods; TG3. To acquire proficiency in the assessment
and interpretation of biomarkers of ART adherence and chronic inflammation. These TGs coupled with the
candidate’s expertise in quantitative methods, biopsychosocial stigma models, and clinical psychology will
barriers to ART adherence faced by
due to intersectional stigma and strategies to counter these barriers through
RA2. Design a technology-enhanced, culturally-sensitive EBI addressing intersectional
stigma-related barriers to ART adherence for BMSM/LWH;
enable him to achieve the following Research Aims (RAs): RA1. Identify
BMSM/LWH in-depth interviews
with ~30 BMSM/LWH;
RA3. Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effect
size estimates of the EBI (RA2) through a pilot RCT with 60 BMSM/LWH.
The EBI
(RA2)
will combine ARemind
with the
Effective Skills to Empower Effective Men (ESTEEM) intervention’s strategies. Because these strategies
focus on sexual orientation stigma, the candidate will adapt them for BMSM/LWH to address intersectional
stigma-related barriers to ART adherence. Participants randomized to the experimental arm will receive the
EBI
(RA2). Participants in the control arm will receive ARemind only. The primary outcome is ART adherence based
on self-report, Medication Event Monitoring System devices, and hair ART levels. The secondary outcomes are
viral suppression and chronic inflammation. The pilot RCT findings will inform an R01 proposal that the candidate
will submit in Year 4 of this Award. This K01 will set the candidate on a clear path to research independence."
11111806,"Project Summary
 Our laboratory has a long standing interest in understanding the catalytic and regulatory mechanism of
the proton pumping vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase, V1Vo-ATPase), a dynamic multisubunit membrane integral
rotary motor enzyme found in all eukaryotic cells. The V-ATPase acidifies the lumen of organelles and, in
professional acid secreting cells, the extracellular space. Enzyme function is required for fundamental cellular
processes such as endocytosis, bone remodeling, protein trafficking, acid-base balance, sperm maturation,
and neurotransmitter release. While complete loss of V-ATPase function is embryonic lethal, partial loss or
hyperactivity is associated with numerous human diseases such as osteopetrosis, diabetes, male infertility,
neurodegeneration, and cancer. Moreover, some viruses such as influenza rely on the acidic environment
created by the V-ATPase for infection. Fighting these diseases on a molecular level will require a detailed
understanding of the structure, catalytic mechanism and regulation of the eukaryotic V-ATPase. In cells, V-
ATPase activity is regulated by a unique mechanism referred to as “reversible disassembly”, wherein the
complex reversibly dissociates into V1-ATPase and Vo proton channel, with both sub-complexes becoming
autoinhibited. Despite its important role in V-ATPase physiology, the molecular mechanism of reversible
disassembly is poorly understood. This gap in knowledge is largely due to a lack of both high-resolution
structural information and an in vitro model system to study the process under defined conditions, aspects that
we are working to address. An interesting, and technically challenging feature of the mammalian V-ATPase is
that most of its subunits are expressed as multiple isoforms. However, as such isoforms display differential
tissue enrichment, they may provide opportunities for targeted therapeutics. Indeed, several diseases have
been linked to malfunction or upregulation of specific isoform containing V-ATPase. However, how different
isoform combinations determine tissue localization, and whether these isoform specific complexes have unique
biochemical or regulatory properties, is currently unknown. We have started to develop a system to purify wild
type and mutant forms of human V-ATPase in an isoform specific fashion for biochemical and structural
analyses. Further, we are developing single-domain antibodies (Nanobodies) against specific subunit isoforms
to serve as research tools, and to explore isoform specific modulation of V-ATPase activity in disease. Our
research program employs the tools of structural biology, cell biology, biochemistry and biophysics to address
broad questions of V-ATPase catalytic and regulatory mechanisms. For some fundamental aspects of V-
ATPase structure and regulation, we study the enzyme from yeast, a well documented model system for the
human V-ATPase. We use human tissue culture for questions that cannot be addressed in yeast, such as
structure and biochemical properties of specific isoform containing enzymes. The long term goal of our
research is to find ways to modulate the activity of disease causing V-ATPases in an isoform specific way."

 Exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) have been linked to chronic diseases and
conditions including breast cancer, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and infertility. Timing of exposure, especially
during pregnancy, may have a lifelong impact on the fetus. Tools and services are urgently needed to allow
individuals to learn about their personal EDC exposures and how to reduce them. Million Marker (MM) is a
precision health company that was formed to fill this need.
 Our mission is to crowdsource and scale the biomonitoring of environmental chemicals and provide
actionable results to consumers in a timely manner in order to empower individuals to proactively assess,
track, and reduce their exposures and live a healthier lifestyle. Starting with a few biomarkers of common
EDCs, our ultimate vision is to discover all possible (“a million”) biomarkers of EDC exposure to inform and
improve individual health outcomes and advance precision medicine. MM is uniquely capable of carrying out
this mission, with our team of multidisciplinary scientists who are highly trained in environmental epidemiology,
toxicology, analytical chemistry, biostatistics, data engineering, and business.
 In Phase I of this study, we developed and tested the FIRST mobile EDC intervention service (app and
exposure report-back) for its efficacy in increasing EH literacy (EHL), readiness to reduce exposures (i.e.
readiness to change, RtC), and system usability among reproductive-age participants recruited from the
Healthy Nevada Project (HNP), one of the largest population health cohorts in the world. We found a general
trend of decreased EDC exposure with the intervention, as well as increased RtC. However, some participants
did not increase their RtC and had difficulty carrying out the intervention on their own (which resulted in no
decrease in EDC exposure). The reasons for these less optimal results were the difficulty in the EHL subject
matter–participants still felt ill-prepared to apply their knowledge to making healthier lifestyle changes.
Therefore, in this Phase II proposal, we will address these perceived limitations by 1) developing and 2) testing
a self-directed online interactive curriculum with live counseling sessions and individualized support modeled
after the highly effective Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and Omada Health (which provides a digital
interactive DPP).
 We plan to develop an EDC-specific online intervention curriculum (Aim 1); test the effectiveness of our
intervention programs (Aim 2); and determine changes in EDC exposure before and after each intervention
program (Aim 3). For Aim 1, we will recruit 15 men and 15 women of child-bearing age from HNP, our Phase I
collaborator to participate in the intervention. For Aims 2 and 3, we will recruit and randomize 300 women and
300 men of reproductive age (total n=600) from HNP. Our target population is adult men and women of
reproductive age (18-44 years old), who are also our target population (as stated in our Commercialization
Plan). At the conclusion of this project, we will be well-positioned to begin Phase IIB and will scale our products
and services to clinics and the general public, with the eventual aims of FDA approval, insurance coverage,
and incorporation into routine clinical care."

 The development, function, and plasticity of GABAergic circuits in the neocortex are critical processes for
establishing and maintaining normal patterns of brain activity. Moreover, the dysregulation of GABA signaling
is implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism. The majority of
studies on GABAergic transmission have focused on fast, phasic signals that inhibit target neurons, negatively
controlling postsynaptic integration and spike generation. However, GABA can also act via tonic currents that
provide a steady-state influence on postsynaptic cells. While tonic GABA largely has been assumed to negatively
regulate neuronal activity, recent data from our lab suggests that it may paradoxically enhance excitability of
dendrites in cortical pyramidal neurons. Whether this unexpected observation extends throughout the
somatodendritic arbor and across cell types is unknown. Additionally, the source of GABA producing tonic
currents remains poorly understood, though evidence suggests it may include the same interneurons mediating
phasic inhibition. In the present study, we propose a combination of electrophysiology, 2-photon imaging,
pharmacology, and optogenetic manipulation both in acute brain slices and in vivo to (1) determine how tonic
GABA currents shape dendritic excitability throughout the arbors of cortical pyramidal neurons, (2) identify the
neuronal sources of GABA mediating tonic currents in the neocortex, and (3) determine the molecular
mechanisms underlying long-term heterosynaptic plasticity of tonic GABAergic signals. Our overall goal is to
understand the links between GABAergic transmission and cortical circuit function. We expect that our results
will generate new avenues for exploring both the cell biology and functional consequences of GABAergic
signaling in the cortex."
11100754,"Our group is broadly interested in the chemical biology of natural products (NPs). We seek to identify new mo-
lecular structures that are formed by unusual enzymatic transformations. One successful approach was the de-
velopment of an innovative discovery workflow that embraces big data genomics. With the sequencing revolution
picking up pace, we are leveraging this vast resource to bioinformatically identify, classify, and experimentally
characterize carefully selected novel NPs. For this project, we focus on bacterial NPs for several reasons: (i)
Bacteria are the most historically significant source of molecular probes and drug leads. Such compounds re-
vealed fundamentally new biology and also transformed the treatment of many human diseases. (ii) Bacteria
dominate all other forms of life in terms of genetic/taxonomic breadth, chemical/metabolic capabilities, and geo-
graphic/environmental diversity. (iii) Bacteria tend to organize the genes involved in NP biosynthesis into neatly
organized clusters, which facilitates their bioinformatic identification and subsequent experimental characteriza-
tion. This proposal unites big data genomics, synthetic biology, and modern chemical biology to structurally and
functionally characterize novel NPs. Herein we target pathways predicted to showcase the molecular results of
new enzymatic transformations with a strong focus on metagenome-derived pathways, especially from bacteria
that associate with invertebrate animals.
Several readily cultivated bacterial genera have been extensively studied, which established certain taxa as
prolific sources of NPs (e.g. soil-dwelling Streptomyces). However, knowledge is sparse on less cultivable bac-
teria, which represent the overwhelming majority of microbial diversity. Only relatively recently have the requisite
technologies emerged to sequence and assemble metagenomic data into reads of useful length. As part of this
project, we have repurposed RODEO, our open access, user-friendly genome-mining tool to analyze data deriv-
ing from metagenome/microbiome sequencing projects. “MetaRODEO” will be validated through isolation and
characterization of several distinct NP classes. We center our efforts on NPs from symbiotic bacteria of inverte-
brates, given that numerous species have longstanding and intimate partnerships with their lower animal hosts.
Evolutionary forces have undoubtedly shaped the bioactivity, improved the pharmacokinetics, and reduced the
animal toxicity of NPs from bacterial symbionts compared to soil-dwelling counterparts.
This project involves three interconnected but independently achievable specific aims. Aim I focuses on genomic
sequencing, bioinformatics analysis, and isolation/characterization of first-in-class RiPPs from the invertebrate
microbiome. Aim II centers on new RiPPs and other NPs derived from microbiome-derived biosynthetic path-
ways that employ radical SAM enzymes. Aim III expands the environmental origin and chemistry of NPs identi-
fied by our algorithm by targeting polyene macrolides. Each aim will elucidate new NP structures and evaluate
biological activity using a rigorous, multi-tiered strategy."

The central tenet of this grant application contains two interdependent components 1) how does the structure
determine the function of K+-channels? and how does the cell membrane phospholipid composition
regulate their structure-function correlations? Our work deal with these two fundamental questions, which
encompasses three aspects of ion channel physiology: 1) Which are the structural changes underlying K+-
channel gating, permeation, and selectivity? 2) How does a bidirectional allosteric coupling between the
activation gate (AG) and the selectivity filter (SF) control K+-channels function? and 3) How does the cell
membrane lipid composition regulate K+-channels behavior? Understanding at the atomic level how K+-
channels work will assist during the discovery of novel therapeutic drugs. We will use several
methodological advancements developed by us during the last 10 years of continuous funding from the NIH.
These achievements are: 1) the elucidation of an atomic resolution gating cycle of a K+-channel 2) the
engineering of a disulfide bridged locked open KcsA scaffold that produces atomic resolution diffracting crystals
and allow us to characterize its function by electrophysiology at pH 7.0 (a physiologically relevant pH) 3) the
measuring of the alkali metal ions binding affinity by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry of the whole selectivity filter
of a K+-channel in the open conformation and/or of individual ion binding sites 4) the discovery of a novel
mechanism of KcsA activation by reducing the thickness of the cell membrane and 5) the development of a
new methodology for the overexpression of properly folded and functional Human K+-channels of
Biomedical Importance in E. coli cells. Our work using KcsA as a structural surrogate is foundational of our
current understanding of K+-channel function. Now we are expanding into human K+-channels by developing a
groundbreaking new methodology for the overexpression of properly folded and functional human Kv-channels
in E. coli cells, which eliminates the otherwise time consuming and outrageously expensive use of eukaryotic
cells. We will develop an integrative understanding of how the structure of ion channels change its conformation
to regulate their function within an energetic landscape determined by the lipid composition of the cell membrane.
We aim to determine the structural changes underlying ion permeation, ion selectivity and C-type inactivation
gating and their interdependence with the lipid bilayer composition of the cell membrane in a bacterial channel
and in two human Kv-channels of Biomedical Relevance. Finally, we will produce a conceptual framework about
how the allosteric coupling between a K+-channel’s selectivity filter and its activation gate define ion channel
function and how is modulated by subunit cooperativity and the phospholipid composition of the cell membrane.
The completion of this grant application will produce invaluable information to assist in the smart design of safer
therapeutic drugs."

 In response to the NIH RFA-RM-19-009, we propose to establish the Stanford-SLAC
CryoET Specimen Preparation Service Center (SCSC) to accomplish four specific aims: (1)
establish a platform, which is available to the scientific community at large, to streamline the
preparation of samples suitable for downstream cryogenic electron tomography (cryoET) data
collection; (2) provide access to advanced cryo-specimen preparation techniques for a wide
range of samples: macromolecular complexes, microcrystals of biological materials, cell
lysates, organelles, cells and tissues; (3) generate a training curriculum for new users on the
preparation of frozen, hydrated biological specimens, with the option of carrying out correlative
cryo-fluorescence light microscopy (cryoFLM), cryo-focused ion beam scanning electron
microscopy (cryoFIB), and cryoET; and (4) adopt new methods for sample preparation using
innovative technologies developed elsewhere. In this proposal, we will leverage our existing
facilities and in-house expertise in each of the following imaging modalities and their integration
into a correlated sample preparation workflow: cryoFLM, cryoFIB, and cryoET. We will establish
all the necessary equipment dedicated to the proposed service and training activities. We will
prepare video curriculum materials to train new users in the aforementioned protocols. We will
adapt our existing infrastructure to manage project administration and resource allocations.
Administrative support is in place to help users with lodging arrangements, as well as laboratory
on-boarding and specimen biosafety approvals. We have a well set- up communication
infrastructure for remote users to participate in actual experiments, particularly for cryoFLM,
cryoFIB, and cryoET. We will provide access to existing Titan Krios microscopes to evaluate
whether the prepared samples are ready for data collection in the associated Hub, which will
be set up at another institution with separate NIH support. We will make our existing Stanford-
SLAC cryo-specimen preparation equipment available on a limited basis immediately after this
proposal is funded. We anticipate serving ~40 users per year once the Center is fully
operational in early Year 2 of the award period. We will also offer regular hands- on workshops
to train ~10-12 new users per year. We will disseminate our resources to the broad community
via a web portal and booths at professional societies’ annual conferences. The number of users
will increase in subsequent years as we and our recurring users optimize the use of the Center’s
resources. In Years 3-6, we will work closely with collaborators pioneering advanced protocols
such as semi-automated and automated cryoFIB and “lift-out” for tissue samples to implement
them in the proposed Center. Lastly, we will assemble a Scientific Advisory Committee of
experts to guide the practices of our Service Center and the ongoing implementation of cutting-
edge technologies."

Lack of diversity among the workforce is a significant contributor to disparities in quality of care for racial and
ethnic minority populations and represents a major obstacle to meaningfully addressing the social
determinants of poor mental health in these population groups. Several key barriers to ensuring a
representative mental health workforce and improving access to quality care include: the massive shortage
and inequitable distribution of skilled providers; the high cost and lack of scalability of training and supervision;
the lack of delivery channels acceptable to recipients; and the lack of attention to social determinants. To
address this, the TEACH study will implement a scalable task-sharing model aimed at building capacity and
supporting a racially diverse workforce of non-specialist providers to deliver brief interventions for the indicated
prevention and early intervention for depression and anxiety, combined with new content tailored to the local
context in low resource, racial and ethnically diverse settings with emphasis on assessing and addressing the
social determinants of mental health in these communities, ultimately contributing to the reduction of disparities
in their communities. The proposed diversity supplement will complement the larger project and will train an
early career researcher in implementation science methodology, training and intervention development, and
grantsmanship in order for her to gain research independence."

The objective of this proposal is to develop targeted therapies for venous malformations (VMs). VMs
are slow-flow vascular lesions associated with disfigurement, pain, and functional impairment.
Recently, systemic inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) with sirolimus has proven
efficacious for treating children with complex VMs. However, systemic drug delivery is associated with
side effects that limit treatment. Therefore, safe, targeted therapies that minimize systemic toxicity are
required.
The proposed project will develop nanoparticulate (NP) targeted drug delivery systems to achieve
high local drug concentration in VMs while minimizing systemic distribution. This will be achieved by
virtue of enhanced permeation and retention (EPR), a well-recognized phenomenon in cancer biology
whereby leaky tumor vasculature allows for preferential uptake of nanoparticles compared to uptake
in tissues with normal vasculature. Passive NP accumulation within VMs, due to EPR, will be
enhanced with active targeting techniques, such as photo-targeting. The surfaces of NPs will be
coated with molecules that encourage cell uptake. These molecules will be inactivated with a “caging
group,” a reversibly bound molecule that is sensitive to a specific wavelength of light. Upon irradiation
with light, the caging molecule will be removed from the NP. Therefore, NPs can be systemically
injected and remain unbound to tissues. However, irradiation of the VM will cause “uncaging” to occur,
which will activate the NPs, and allow for enhanced NP binding and drug release at the target site.
To test this hypothesis, we propose three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Formulation and
characterization of NPs with prolonged dwell times in VMs. Specific Aim 2: Study of targeted NP drug
delivery systems in vivo. Specific Aim 3: Study of NP drug delivery systems on therapeutic efficacy in
vivo. With the guidance and mentorship of Dr. Daniel Kohane, Dr. Cullion has developed a career
development plan to provide the mentored research, technical skill development, and didactic training
needed to achieve her goals of (1) becoming an expert in nanomedicine and drug delivery for the
treatment of VMs and (2) achieving scientific independence and becoming an R01 funded physician-
scientist with a career in translational research focused on nanomedicine and drug delivery for
vascular anomalies."

The ability to perceive and respond to vocalizations across behavioral contexts is key for survival, but the
mechanisms for how the brain derives meaning from acoustic features to drive appropriate behavioral responses
remain unknown. I will test the overall hypothesis that top-down control of feed-forward auditory circuits via
cortical projection neurons is critical for recognition of social calls and routing of sensory information to circuits
driving behavior. In the mentored (K99) phase, I will take advantage of an ethological mouse behavior studied
extensively in my postdoctoral lab, in which parentally-experienced mice search for lost pups in response to a
specific type of vocalization. Experienced moms are experts at this behavior, but it can also be learned by virgins,
and learning is correlated with plasticity in the left auditory cortex in females. Pup retrieval involves a complex
sequence of actions, and auditory cues may be required during specific epochs. I will build upon my pilot data
finding that cortical projection neurons are necessary for retrieval, and that exposure to pup calls drives sustained
activity in a distinct projection in experienced females. Aim 1 (K99) uses imaging and multi-area ensemble
recordings to ask how inter-area dynamics in recurrent auditory circuits change during pup calls compared to
non-vocal sounds with similar temporal structures, with the hypothesis that network activity is elevated
specifically during vocalizations to facilitate brain state modulation or communication with sensorimotor circuits
over time scales relevant for behavior. Synaptic mechanisms driving this persistent activity will be examined with
in vivo whole-cell recordings. Aim 2 (K99) will test which projection neurons are required for retrieval and over
what behavioral time scales. Animals vocalize in multiple situations to communicate distinct meanings – for
example, male calls to communicate aggression or courtship – and the brain must make sense of these calls,
using acoustic features as well as non-auditory context cues to distinguish between meanings. In the
independent phase (R00), Aim 3 asks whether calls are processed with neural ensembles and inter-area
dynamics that are generalized across categories or distinct for specific behavioral outcomes. Additionally, the
relevance of different social calls can change depending on an animal’s internal state. Aim 4 (R00) investigates
whether neural ensemble representations of male calls change in female mice as sexual receptivity varies,
measuring activity in cortical ensembles tracked over weeks of experience. In the mentored phase I will complete
a training plan designed to strengthen the experimental and computational skills needed for my research
program as an independent investigator, and to build the professional skills needed for success as a faculty
member, taking advantage of resources and expertise available from the mentor, advisory committee and
broader environment at NYU."

Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) are projected to affect 14 million Americans by 2050. To
date, though, research on the signs and symptoms of ADRD has been sparse in early midlife populations,
especially at the national level. It is crucial to conduct such research because early changes in cognitive
functioning and the accumulation of risk factors for ADRD can begin decades before concrete signs and
symptoms emerge. The challenging search for the causes of ADRD has made it clear that prospective and
comprehensive data—including detailed social, biological, and health measurements across the life course—
are needed to identify key predictors of ADRD. As such, the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult
Health (Add Health) provides an extraordinary opportunity to study the early origins of cognitive
functioning/change and ADRD risk in a nationally representative cohort that has been followed since
adolescence and will be in their mid-40s in the next wave of data collection (Wave VI). The overall goal of this
project is to collect and disseminate critical data related to cognitive, physical, and sensory functioning in
conjunction with the Add Health Wave VI Core Project to facilitate identification of early risk factors for later life
ADRD. Adding such rich measures to Wave VI of Add Health will make possible tracking of cognitive, sensory,
and physical functioning across the life course; coupled with the testing of biological risk markers, it will also lay
the foundation for detecting signs of cognitive impairment and ADRD risk in early midlife. These new data,
when combined with Add Health’s existing 25-year collection of extraordinarily rich multi-level and longitudinal
measures and its new Wave VI data, will also aid in the scientific community’s understanding of the interplay of
social, behavioral, and biological factors leading to ADRD in later life. Moreover, because Add Health is a very
diverse sample, adding these data to Wave VI will greatly increase understanding of cognitive, physical, and
sensory functioning within health disparity populations. The project’s specific aims are to: 1) Collect new in-
depth, in-person assessments of cognitive functioning in early midlife for a nationally representative and
racially/ethnically diverse subsample of participants in Wave VI; 2) Collect automated, (largely) web-based
measures of cognition in early midlife for all participants in Wave VI and compare them with our in-person
measures of cognition to assess their feasibility and value; 3) Include assessments of physical and sensory
functioning in early midlife for Wave VI participants of Add Health; 4) Test for biological markers of ADRD risk
and cognitive function in early midlife; 5) Clean, document, disseminate, promote, and support the data
collected in this project for the scientific community."

While there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that music training benefits brain development, the evidence is not conclusive and rigorously designed randomized control trial (RCT) neuroimaging studies are needed to provide a definitive answer to whether and which brain circuits are enhanced by music training and how. We aim to address this gap: we propose an RCT to robustly test the hypothesis that systematic music training will benefit development of brain inhibition control circuitry among Hispanic youth from underserved communities. Prior work including ours provided suggestive evidence that long-term music training in children may lead to neuroplastic functional changes in the associated frontal brain circuitry and improvement of inhibitory control. 

During the R61 phase, we will test the feasibility (recruitment, retention, adherence and intent to continue) of a RCT on 40 Hispanic children between ages 6-8, of whom will be assigned to a 24-month intervention trial targeting community and group-focused after school music training (MG) or to an after-school program comprising arts, book clubs, ethnic and culture studies without specific focus on systematic music training, the control group (CG). We will use multi-modal imaging and behavioral probes to measure two aspects of inhibition control: (1) response inhibition by using a stop-signal task and (2) delayed gratification using a computerized task wherein children will be asked to choose immediate vs. delayed monetary rewards. Neuroimaging measures will be obtained twice, pre and post 2-yr intervention. Behavioral measures will be obtained at baseline and yearly thereafter. During the R33 phase, we will additionally recruit 74 Hispanic children between ages 6-8 and assess them with the same imaging and behavioral measurements using the same testing timeline as in R61. This is the first RCT using neuroimaging to assess whether and how music training enhances brain inhibition control circuitry. By focusing on Hispanic children from underserved communities our results will shed light on the effects of music training on development of brain function. And early life brain-to-behavior changes induced by music training may have long-term positive effects on an individual's health and success."
11102173,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The transition from adolescence to adulthood is a critical period of development characterized by significant
changes in social-emotional behavior. One of the central brain structures modulating this transition is the
amygdala. The development of the amygdala continues through adolescence, undergoing an expansion in size
and neuron number into early adulthood. These changes enable healthy social and emotional development, and
perturbations in amygdala development and maturation are linked a host of mental health disorders, most notably
autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the amygdala neuronal and circuit substrates underlying changes
coincident with this major life transition remain little understood.
In our published studies in humans, and our unpublished work in mice, we identified and characterized a unique
population of immature neurons in the paralaminar nucleus of the amygdala (PL). While these neurons are born
embryonically, they interestingly delay their maturation until adolescence when they differentiate into excitatory
neurons. Thus, the PL is well positioned to play a key role in the behavioral changes that are associated with the
transition from adolescence to maturity. The goal of our proposed studies is to understand the role of amygdala
late-maturing neurons in the circuitry, neuronal responsivity and behavioral transition that occurs during
adolescence. To test this, we will examine the dynamic circuit changes in input connectivity (Aim 1), neuronal
responsiveness (Aim 2), and the role the PL plays in the behavioral transition (Aim 3) from adolescence to early
adulthood.
Our discovery and characterization of PL neurons that undergo maturation coincident with adolescence suggests
a novel mechanism of brain plasticity during a critical stage of post natal development. Our proposed studies are
also an essential step to understanding the role late maturing PL neurons play in neuro-atypical brain function
associated with disorders of social cognition such as ASD and the long-term consequences of early life stress."

This application aims to build on our recent discoveries of olfactory “gating” of visual attraction in Aedes aegypti
mosquitoes and determine the role of color vision in host and nectar selection. Without vision, mosquitoes
cannot track odors, locate hosts, or find mates. Vision is a critical sensory modality involved in long-range
olfactory search behaviors and near-host behaviors involved in landing and biting. Despite this potential
importance, little is known about vision in anthropophilic mosquitoes and the neural bases of these behaviors.
Mosquitoes can see a host from 2-15 m, and our recent findings show that odor “turns on” their visual attraction
to hosts, thereby playing a critical role by linking long-distance odor tracking with short-range behaviors near the
host. Our work also demonstrated that mosquitoes are sensitive to wavelengths reflected from human skin.
However, we lack an understanding of how odor sensitizes the visual system, and the visual preferences of
diverse anthropophilic mosquitoes. We have developed new tools to examine olfactory-visual integration,
including new Aedes GCaMP6s mosquito lines, the generation of opsin knockout lines, and biogenic amine
receptor mutants. This proposal builds on our preliminary findings that demonstrate the importance of color
vision and neuromodulators in olfactory-visual integration in mosquitoes. Using semi-field and behavioral
assays, calcium imaging in tethered flying mosquitoes, and molecular-genetic approaches, we propose to study
the color preferences of mosquitoes and how odor modulates visual neurons. Aim 1 will allow us to characterize
the colors (wavelengths) that attract different anthropophilic mosquito species and identify the odors that turn on
visual search behaviors. In Aim 2, using Aedes aegypti, we will determine the neural mechanisms by which
odors turn on visual search behaviors, and identify the rhodopsins that detect important wavelengths. Our
preliminary results indicate that octopamine is critical for olfactory-visual integration. We will generate cell-
specific knockout of the octopamine receptor to determine how olfactory-visual behaviors are compromised. In
parallel, we will mutate specific long- and short-wavelength rhodopsins to suppress attraction to colors indicating
hosts or nectar sources. We will also use new GCaMP6s lines to record from visual neurons in the mosquito
brain and characterize how odor modulates those neurons. Aim 3 will test the wavelengths and visual features
(motion, object size) that mosquitoes find attractive, and test them in new trap designs in semi-field trials.
While there has been extensive work on olfaction in mosquitoes, our work emphasizes that color vision also
plays a key role. Olfactory-visual integration is vital in diverse insect vectors, including tsetse flies and kissing
bugs. We suggest that our proposed experiments provide a basic framework for understanding how these cues
influence haematophagous insects. Furthermore, results from this work will provide information on attractive
visual lures, and motivate the identification of molecular targets to cripple visual-olfactory behaviors."

Recent research, done as part of the parent grant, resulted in the important revelation that e-cigarette (e-cig)
operating power may be more relevant for metal exposure and associated brain metal accumulation and
neurotoxicity than total aerosol dose (aerosol concentration times exposure duration). Our data show that metal
accumulation in e-cig aerosol from an open e-cig device massively and dose-dependently increases with
operating power within the range recommended by the manufacturer (30-50 W). Moreover, while our previous
2-month mouse exposure experiment, performed with e-cig aerosol produced at 40 W, revealed significant and
dose-dependent metal deposition and dyshomeostasis in mouse brain (Re et al., 2021), our latest data indicates
that the lower levels of metals measured in e-cig aerosol generated at 30 W do not cause overt metal deposition
in mouse brain even after 6 months of chronic exposure. Yet, this exposure paradigm caused some neurotoxicity,
especially in males carrying the Parkinson’s Disease (PD)-linked mutation, as shown by motor deficit and gait
impairment, potentially attributable to other aerosol components such as aldehydes. This recent finding leads to
the central hypothesis of this diversity supplement, that e-cig operating power may be more relevant for metal
exposure and associated brain metal accumulation and neurotoxicity than total aerosol dose. Leveraging the
experiments from the parent grant, we will rigorously evaluate the effects of operating power on the levels of
neurotoxic metals and aldehydes produced in e-cig aerosol, and the neurotoxic consequences of chronic
inhalation exposure to these aerosols. We will expand the aims of the parent grant by: 1) measuring metal and
aldehyde mixtures in e-cig aerosol produced at 30, 40 and 50 W, 2) examining cognitive/motor deficit progression
and endpoint brain neurotoxicity in mice exposed at 30 or 50 W and contrast these with our previous exposure
study performed at 40 W, and finally 3) untangling the modulatory effects of sex and genetic susceptibility to PD
on these neurotoxic outcomes. In Aim 1, we will determine metal and aldehyde mixture composition of e-cig
aerosols as a function of e-cig operating power by collecting e-cig aerosols from a device operated at three
different powers (30, 40 and 50 W). We will also evaluate coil aging effects on aerosol chemical composition, by
taking samples for several weeks over consecutive days (to cool down the device between uses). For Aim 2, we
will investigate whether operating power is a critical determinant of brain metal accumulation, neurobehavioral
toxicity and neuropathology in mice chronically exposed to e-cig aerosol. In Aim 3, we will evaluate whether sex
and genetic susceptibility to PD modify the dependence of the aerosol mixture neurotoxicity in mice on e-cig
operating power (30-50 W). Our findings could support regulatory interventions (e.g., limiting operating power)
ultimately resulting in reduced neurotoxicity due to vaping. By providing advanced skills, training, and research
opportunities to an MS student with a focus in Toxicology, this project will enhance diversity in our research team
at Columbia University and down the road in the field of environmental health sciences."

Particulate matter air pollution <2.5µm (PM2.5) is the leading environmental risk factor globally, contributing more
to global mortality than AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and wars/famines combined. The health risks associated
with PM2.5 are predominantly from cardiovascular (CV) causes, with data supporting a major public health impact
due to disorders such as type 2 diabetes. Building on the substantial successes of our research program, that in
large part have provided the foundational basis for our understanding of mechanisms of PM2.5-induced
cardiometabolic disorders, we propose an innovative framework of translational investigations. Our new data
provide compelling links between PM2.5 exposure and circadian rhythm (CR) disruption through epigenetic
reprogramming, resulting in metabolic dysfunction and insulin resistance. In accordance with the NIEHS
Translational Research Framework, we propose an ambitious plan encompassing 3 goals over 8 years that will
encompass harmonized studies involving concentrated ambient PM2.5 exposures (animal) and human
intervention trials across the ambient exposure spectrum, predicated and supported by results from genome
wide association and mendelian randomization approaches, that will identify pathways of air pollution mediated
CV risk. Leveraging on-going translational clinical trials of air pollution reduction using personalized strategies in
vulnerable populations in Beijing, and through one new study involving mitigation of air pollution (ITS-MY-AIR),
we will evaluate the impact of exposure reduction on CR disruption/sleep and metabolic endpoints. Collectively,
results from this project will help shed important new light on air pollution, its impact on CR and cardiometabolic
disorders and provide influential data on protective effects of personal intervention strategies, that together could
change public health policy."

11100982,"Laser lithotripsy (LL) is commonly used for kidney stone treatment, with cavitation playing a crucial role in stone
fragmentation. However, the relationship between cavitation activities and stone damage remains unclear. This supplement
study by Anthony DiSpirito will utilize deep learning to predict stone damage based on passive cavitation mapping (PCM)
signals. A three-dimensional PCM system will be employed, along with B-mode Ultrasound (US) for data acquisition. Deep
learning enables the optimization of LL procedures by automating feature selection and identifying key factors driving stone
damage. Our approach will offer valuable insights into medical practice, advancing the efficacy of LL treatments. We will
adopt deep learning module combined with cavitation activities information, and we can better predict the potential damaged
induced by bubble collapsing. Our result will also demonstrate the strong correlation between bubble collapsing information
with stone crater damage. This approach can also be further explored with more sophisticated scenarios and clinical
applications."
11100985,"PROJECT SUMMARY
For the development of an organism from a single cell, the genome must be duplicated and precisely distributed
during every cell division. Given the astronomical number of cell division events involved in building and
maintaining organisms (by one estimate, the adult human body is made up of 40 trillion cells, with at least a
couple of trillion dividing every day), it becomes critical that the distribution of the replicated genome to daughter
cells, a process known as chromosome segregation, occurs with extremely high accuracy. Errors in chromosome
segregation underlie birth defects/infertility and are sufficient to trigger the genomic havoc that is a hallmark of
cancer. Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which cells ensure accurate chromosome segregation during
cell division has both fundamental and therapeutic significance. Our work is focused on kinetochores, protein
machines that assemble on mitotic chromosomes to orchestrate their segregation. Kinetochores coordinate
multiple microtubule-interfacing activities that collectively orient and segregate chromosomes, while also
integrating mechanical events with signaling mechanisms that control the decision to either remain in or exit from
mitosis. Our early work identified a conserved set of proteins, referred to as the KMN network (for Knl1 complex,
Mis12 complex, Ndc80 complex) that lies at the heart of these coordinated kinetochore functions. In Aim 1, we
focus on the ability of kinetochores to both accelerate and delay exit from mitosis, which we propose optimizes
mitotic duration to allow sufficient time for all chromosomes to connect to the spindle, while also minimizing time
spent in a vulnerable phase when major cellular functions such as transcription, translation and secretion are
downregulated. The work we propose tackles major open questions related to this duality of mitotic timing control
by kinetochores. The primary mechanical activity of the kinetochore is to couple to dynamic spindle microtubules.
Several distinct microtubule-interfacing activities concentrate at kinetochores as well as on mitotic chromatin,
which makes analysis of chromosome-microtubule interactions challenging in a cellular context. In Aim 2, we
describe a ""blank slate–add back"" approach, in which we eliminate all microtubule-interfacing activities on mitotic
chromosomes and then add them back in isolation. This approach complements traditional loss-of-function
analysis and will be used to study the microtubule-interfacing activities at kinetochores that orient and center
chromosomes on the spindle and that shut of the signal that prevents mitotic exit until microtubule attachments
are made. Finally, to achieve accurate segregation, kinetochore-microtubule interactions must be tightly
regulated. In Aim 3, we focus on the poorly understood regulatory mechanism by which a spindle pole-generated
gradient of the mitotic kinase Aurora A controls kinetochore-microtubule attachments. As Aurora A is amplified
in specific cancer contexts, this effort has the potential to reveal cancer-specific dysregulation of chromosome
segregation and suggest potential new therapeutic avenues."
11101551,"Project Summary
The wide-reaching impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic highlight the extreme threat posed by the cross-species
emergence of zoonotic pathogens. Bats (order: Chiroptera) are the natural reservoir hosts for the majority of
the world’s most virulent zoonotic viruses, including Hendra and Nipah henipaviruses, Ebola and Marburg
filoviruses, and SARS, MERS, and now SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses. Remarkably, bats exhibit little
demonstrable disease upon infection with viruses that cause extreme pathology in other mammals, likely in
part due to their unique anti-inflammatory molecular adaptations, which are thought to have evolved to mitigate
the accumulation of physiological damage accrued during flight. Surprisingly, isolated island bat communities
around the world support the endemic circulation of numerous viruses in populations below the critical
community size required for persistence of related pathogens in other hosts. Since cross-species spillover of
several bat-borne viruses bears a distinctive seasonal signature, coincident with the timing of reproductive and
nutritional stress for the bat hosts in question, disentangling the mechanisms governing the transmission,
circulation, and persistence of these viruses in wild bat populations is of critical public health interest. In part
with the research initiatives proposed here, we will use molecular and serological tools to develop a
longitudinal time series of immunological and infection data for henipaviruses and coronaviruses circulating in
wild fruit bats in Madagascar, leveraging samples collected in our longterm wildlife surveillance effort. Bats are
widely consumed as a source of human food in Madagascar, and preliminary data from our research group
demonstrates serological signatures of prior human exposure to these zoonotic viruses across the island. We
propose to fit disparate dynamical models to the resulting population-level data in order to distinguish
mechanisms underpinning seasonal viral shedding pulses and concomitant transmission in these bat hosts. In
addition to population-level studies, we will also construct within-host models of viral control in a single bat
immune system, which we will fit to experimental infection data from Betacoronavirus-challenged bats in the
laboratory, with the aim of deciphering the mechanisms which motivate viral shedding. Our project aims to
simultaneously develop molecular tools of bat cell lines and viruses with which to support within-host studies in
our own Madagascar system. Finally, we will build on population-level and within-host studies to model and
implement a vaccine intervention designed to eradicate circulating henipavirus from a test-population of
Madagascar fruit bats. Broadly, our project aims to use a uniquely integrative combination of field, molecular,
and modeling tools to enable the prediction and prevention of bat virus spillover events before they occur."
11101626,"The long-term goal of the PI Zhang’s laboratory is to decipher intertwined regulatory layers and
mechanisms that control RNA silencing and processing, and to eventually manipulate the regulatory
components and pathways in biotechnological applications. Here this proposal is to describe how the PI Zhang
will investigate unknown mechanisms and regulations of several newly identified components within two
master regulatory hubs centered on Serrate (SE) and Suppressor of Gene Silencing 3 (SGS3) for RNA
silencing in Arabidopsis. RNA silencing clears endogenous and invasive transcripts, and this process is
directed by microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in eukaryotes. MicroRNAs are
produced from hairpin-structured primary miRNA substrates (pri-miRNAs) by microprocessor that comprises of
Dicer-like protein 1 (DCL1), dsRNA binding protein 1 (DRB1), and SE. By contrast, siRNA production entails
the initial conversion of single-stranded (ss) RNA to double-stranded (ds) RNA via a complex composed of
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) and SGS3 before its entry into DCL4/DRB4 complex. Since levels
of miRNAs and siRNAs are critical for their proper functionality in biology, the processing and accumulation of
small RNAs need to be tightly controlled. In research area 1, the PI Zhang will study how the components in
the SE-centered hub regulate miRNA production. Briefly, the PI Zhang laboratory has recently discovered that
RNA secondary structure (RSS) of pri-miRNAs can be remodeled to regulate DCL1/HYL1 activity. Importantly,
several RNA helicases (RHs) have been newly recovered from the hub, but how they sensor and re-wire RSS
of pri-miRNAs to control miRNA production is unknown. Furthermore, extensive preliminary data also identify
key connections between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and microprocessor components that modulate
miRNA production. Thus, the PI Zhang will systematically investigate the novel functions and mechanisms of
the RHs and catalases from SE hub in miRNA biogenesis in Area 1. In research Area 2, the PI Zhang
focuses on the major gap in the siRNA production that is how ssRNA substrates are specified and loaded onto
SGS3/RDR6 for dsRNA synthesis. Through a newly developed genetic screening, numerous novel
components exemplified by U1-70K and BICE1 among others have been recovered to be engaged in siRNA-
mediated RNA silencing. Remarkably, the components interact with RNA polymerases in nucleus and
ribosomes in cytoplasm as well as the shared SGS3 protein. In this setting, the PI Zhang would
comprehensively study how these factors help SGS3 to fetch the nascent transcripts from chromatin, and to
set up the platform for SGS3/RDR6 nearby ribosomes to synthesize dsRNAs. The proposed study will not only
reveal new regulatory layers and mechanisms of RNA silencing, but also enable us to explore the highly
conserved components to control small RNA production and activities in biological processes, and to
eventually to cure physiological disorders that arise from dysfunctions of RNA processing in biotechnology."
11102687,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The airway epithelium serves as a barrier between the aerosol environment and the underlying
submucosa. Inhaled air often carries noxious agents and pathogens that can injure the lung. Severe lung injury
can lead to persistent inflammation, dysplastic repair, and permanent loss of gas exchange surface area. Injury
from common respiratory viral infection, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2, can lead to chronic lung disease
or exacerbation of lung conditions. Airway cells contribute to regeneration following lung injury, although the
heterogeneity of airway cell identity following lung repair is incompletely understood.
 My research centers on rare airway cell types and their function in the post-viral lung. We have
previously studied the differentiation of an unexpected airway cell type, tuft cells, during repair. Using single
nucleus expression and accessible chromatin sequencing to survey airway cells following influenza injury, we
identify a rare airway cell present in the post-viral lung, Microfold (M) cells. M cells have not been studied in the
lung but in other contexts associate with lymphoid follicles, where they function to capture and deliver luminal
antigens and secrete chemokines. The proposed research will identify pulmonary M cell progenitors and
determine mechanisms required for M cell differentiation. This proposal uncovers M cells as part of a follicle
associated epithelium (FAE) overlying induced bronchus associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT), implying M cells
function to promote mucosal immune responses. The proposed aims will define the role of M cells in lung
immune surveillance. My future research program will test the role of M cells in secondary bacterial infection,
as much of the morbidity of pulmonary influenza infections can be attributed to secondary bacterial infection.
Examining interactions between M cells and the immune compartment will contribute to our understanding of
immune regulation during post-viral chronic inflammation.
 A second outcome from my focus on airway repair following severe influenza infection is an effort to
promote the resolution of basal-like scar tissue into normal alveolar epithelium. Bronchiolization of the distal
airway is a hallmark of multiple human lung diseases, and providing regenerative therapies will require detailed
understanding of the regulation of basal-like cells. I propose defining a genetic mouse model that promotes
differentiation of alveolar basal-like cells into alveolar epithelial cell fates.
 My primary mentor is Dr. Xin Sun, a leader in the field of lung biology who has made fundamental
discoveries in lung development and disease. I will receive guidance from my mentorship committee, a group
with expertise in lung biology and physiology, immunology and epigenetics. The proposed experiments and
training plan will further my skills in bioinformatics and immunology. This research will be conducted at
University of California San Diego, a leading research institution with necessary resources and a collaborative
scientific community."

Adolescents—individuals 10-19 years old—are a unique population undergoing dynamic cognitive, social, psychological, and physical changes. Yet there is a dearth of research on adolescent tuberculosis (TB) epidemiology. Standard TB research reporting conventions make it difficult to examine this group: 10-14 year olds are grouped with children, while 15-19 year olds with adults. Notably, research findings in children and adults may have limited applicability to adolescents, leaving large knowledge gaps about TB during adolescence. With their ability to spread TB and expanding social networks, adolescents may be an important group to target in order to break cycles of TB transmission. By using geospatial and genotypic analyses of transmission networks around adolescents with TB, we can better characterize local TB transmission in high burden settings. These methods will elucidate important person, place, and time interactions of TB transmission in adolescents. I propose to complete three aims, focused in epidemiology and data science, using existing data from Lima, Peru. In Aim 1, I will characterize the spatial heterogeneity of TB transmission events in adolescents. I will identify spatial clusters of genotypically matched TB cases, using MIRU-VNTR- and whole genome sequencing-based data, to identify locations where recent transmission has occurred. I will visualize these spatial clusters using non-parametric distance-based mapping. In Aim 2, I will predict the spatial distribution of TB transmission events in adolescents. I will assess the association between spatial distributions of individual-, household-, and population-level characteristics with the spatial variability of TB transmission events in adolescents using hierarchical Bayesian spatial models. Then, I will build an integrated model combining random forests and ordinary kriging to generate spatial predictions of TB transmission events in adolescents. In Aim 3, I will estimate and compare the impact of screening and treatment interventions tailored for adolescents on reducing community TB transmission. I will conduct a simulation study, calibrated to the local epidemic curve and spatiotemporal clustering pattern of adolescent TB transmission events. I will quantify how a set of interventions tailored to adolescents can reduce TB transmission in a community. Interventions include active screening efforts, increasing TB preventive treatment, and treatment support to increase treatment completion rates. My K01 portfolio of mentored research and training will enable me to develop expertise in adolescent tuberculosis epidemiology, spatial analysis, and TB transmission dynamics. This award will enable me to take the next critical step toward becoming an independent and influential scientist, including a research grant (R01) proposal to test novel, targeted interventions in high-risk populations, like adolescents. I have defined a detailed career development plan and assembled an experienced team of mentors: Prof. Megan Murray and Prof. Mercedes Becerra, globally renowned experts in TB transmission dynamics and pediatric TB epidemiology, respectively."
11111915,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause severe diseases in humans (COVID-
19) that presents a major threat for global public health. Since it was first reported in 12/2019, COVID-19 has
become a pandemic that continues to spread, with >246 million confirmed cases and >5 million deaths as of
11/02/2021. In addition to the human tragedy, the magnitude of the pandemic-driven implosion of global
economies is enormous. Although vaccines are now available, their efficacy appears to be reduced with
spreading viral strains. Remdesivir is the only approved antiviral targeting SARS-CoV-2, but it has little effect on
COVID-19 mortality. Therefore, it is critical to identify and develop additional antivirals to combat viral infection.
 The following strong preliminary data enable targeting of SARS-CoV-2: 1) Construction of an extensive
collection of SARS-CoV-2 replicon systems that enable cutting-edge, rapid, and economical high-throughput
screening. 2) Preparation of cell lines that stably express SARS-CoV-2 replicon. 3) Preliminary screening of
chemical libraries led to the discovery of a novel SARS-CoV-2 antiviral, which has already been improved with
one round of optimization through medicinal chemistry efforts. 4) Multiplex visualization of single-genomic or
subgenomic (+) or (-) SARS-CoV-2 RNA and simultaneously viral and/or host proteins in individual infected cells.
5) Cutting-edge rapid high-throughput infectious virus BSL3 assays that enable kinetic, mechanistic, drug
resistance studies. 6) In-house cloning expression and purification of 10 SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins
(nsps). 7) Biochemical and biophysical assays to measure the enzymatic activities of several SARS-CoV and
SARS-CoV-2 nsp proteins and to measure compound binding to nsps.
 We hypothesize that our recently developed replicon systems can be used for the discovery of anti-SARS-
CoV-2 hits, which upon hit-to-lead optimization can become COVID-19 drug candidates. To address this
hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims:
1. Use of SARS-CoV-2 replicon plasmid systems and SARS-CoV-2 replicon-expressing cell lines to screen
 chemical libraries for antiviral hits.
2. Inhibition and resistance studies with prioritized inhibitors.
3. Hit-to-lead optimization
 These studies will lead to antivirals with strong potency and pharmacokinetic profiles, setting the stage for
development of SARS-CoV-2 antivirals and combination therapies."

Black adolescents and young adults (AYAs) are disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic. In Alabama
(AL), a state identified in the Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative for America as a geographic hot spot, over
30% of new HIV infections occur in people aged 13 to 24 with over 80% of these infections occurring in Black
AYAs. In addition to high HIV incidence rates among this population, sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates
are also high in the South with Black AYAs disproportionately impacted. Given the largely asymptomatic nature
of both HIV and STIs, testing is necessary for diagnoses; however only 9% of adolescents have ever been tested
for HIV and yearly STI testing rates for this population are around 9%. Utilizing a syndemic theory approach
requires the consideration of other co-existing epidemics among this population, such as mental illness, drug
usage, and the social determinants of health (SDH) and how they may synergistically increase HIV and STI
acquisition risk. To improve HIV diagnosis in an EHE priority area we propose to evaluate various HIV and STI
testing modalities (i.e., facility based versus at home testing). We will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and
testing modality preferences for student populations at a Historically Black College and University (HBCU),
Stillman College, in Tuscaloosa, AL. The RE-AIM and CFIR implementation science frameworks will be utilized
in addition to a syndemics theory framework to better understand the role of syndemics in testing modality
preferences and follow through. In Aim 1, we will collect process data from Five Spot, the HIV and STI testing
provider and our community partner, to evaluate the uptake, distribution, and use of various STI and HIV testing
modalities. Five Spot will offer HIV and STI testing options to students attending Stillman while collecting data
on testing uptake and follow-up care (e.g., number of students tested, STI and HIV testing modality used, number
of students testing positive for any STI and/or HIV, testing and/or treatment/linkage to care or prevention). In
Aim 2, we will use a quantitative, online survey with 200 students attending Stillman College to assess
preferences for STI and HIV testing modalities (i.e., facility-based versus at home testing, secondary distribution
to partners), sexual risk behaviors, STI and HIV testing history, past medical history, implementation outcomes
informed by RE-AIM, and syndemic factors that may impact testing uptake and testing preferences, such as
mental illness, drug usage, and SDH. In Aim 3, if awarded year 2, we will conduct qualitative in-depth interviews
with key stakeholders and students attending Stillman College to explore barriers and facilitators to uptake and/or
follow through of HIV/STI testing and treatment and identify additional needed services. The stakeholder
interviews will focus on sustainability, opportunities for expansion, and unmet needs. We will solicit feedback
from our Community Advisory Board comprised of key stakeholders including AYAs, youth advocates, healthcare
workers, and school administration throughout the study period to inform and adapt our project to the needs of
the local community in AL."

Summary of the parent R01GM148583-01A1: Antibiotic resistant infections already kill more people per year
than HIV/AIDS or malaria. Clinical antibiotic resistance is correlated with the overexpression of particular efflux
pumps. These efflux pumps shuttle out most classes of antibiotics so that the antibiotics can’t reach their
targets, reducing their effectiveness. The most accessible part of the efflux pump is its outer membrane barrel.
The outer membrane barrel accessibility makes it a good target for pharmaceutical development because it
can be accessed without getting through the often impermeable outer membrane. The efflux pump presents as
both a possible target for stopping antibiotic efflux and a possible avenue of drug delivery. Plugging efflux
pumps would make the antibiotics we already have work like new by stopping antibiotics from being removed
from the cell and allowing them to reach their targets. Hijacking the barrel for cellular import could be used to
deliver drugs that otherwise could not cross the bacterial outer membrane. Our long term goal is to develop
peptides to combat antibiotic resistant infection. The objective of the proposed research is to determine 1) what
protein-protein interactions are necessary to create high affinity plugs and 2) what protein-protein interactions
can facilitate peptide transit through the pump. We have recently solved the first structure of an exogenous
protein binding the outer membrane barrel of the E. coli antibiotic resistance. It is an unusual helix-in-barrel
structure. We have shown that the binding of this protein has some ability to act as a plug. It stops efflux and
make antibiotics more potent. We have also created databases of outer membrane barrels to better
understand the sequence structure relationships in these proteins. Here we propose to leverage these past
successes to 1) Identify common sequence and structural barrel-peptide interactions for antibiotic efflux pump-
like proteins 2) Screen for peptides that bind well to the E. coli antibiotic efflux pump and identify the features
that determine that binding, and 3) Identify what would facilitate the translocation of proteins across the efflux
pump that otherwise bind to the efflux pump. The global concept of this work, creating new plugs and
translocators for membrane β-barrels, has, to our knowledge, never been done before. The expected
outcomes of these experiments are a knowledge of how protein-protein interactions facilitate plugging and
pulling through of antibiotic efflux pumps, as well as the creation of peptides that plug or pull through TolC. This
work is poised to make a significant contribution because it will demonstrate the important protein-protein
interactions necessary to create membrane protein plugs and translocators and can thereby enable a revival of
existing antibiotics against resistant superbugs."
11101088,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Malaria is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, responsible for the deaths of hundreds of
thousands of individuals per year, primarily children and pregnant women. Effective control is hampered by the
lack of a vaccine and continually emerging drug resistance. Most cases of severe malaria are caused by
Plasmodium falciparum, which is an obligate intracellular parasite of human red blood cells (RBCs). Therefore,
critical host factors may provide an untapped source of new therapeutic targets. Red blood cell invasion is
complex process that involves interactions between several parasite ligands and host receptors, but there
remains a fundamental gap in knowledge regarding the functional role(s) of RBC host factors for P. falciparum.
This gap in our knowledge is, in part, due to RBCs being terminally differentiated and lacking DNA, thereby
precluding conventional genetic experimentation. To surmount this roadblock, we have recently developed
CRISPR-Cas9-based methods to generate null mutants in primary human hematopoietic stem cells and
efficiently differentiate them ex-vivo to mature cultured RBCs (cRBCs), opening new opportunities for functional
analysis of these important cells. Our objective in this proposal is to comprehensively determine the specific
roles and functions of two novel RBC host factors required for P. falciparum invasion, CD44 and CD55, which
were recently identified from a forward genetic screen. Our central hypothesis, supported by strong preliminary
data, is that these critical surface receptors play distinct yet synergistic roles to facilitate P. falciparum invasion
through their interactions with parasite ligands and subsequent signaling to the host cell. In the first aim, we will
determine the precise steps involving CD44 and CD55 in P. falciparum invasion of human RBCs using live cell
imaging and advanced microscopy. In the second aim, avidity-based and proximity labeling proteomic
approaches will be used to identify P. falciparum and RBC binding partners for CD44 and CD55. In the final aim,
we will define host RBC signaling pathways activated by P. falciparum invasion, and test their dependence on
CD44 and CD55. Together, these studies will generate a comparative understanding of the mechanistic roles of
two novel host factors crucial for P. falciparum invasion. In addition to revealing new insights into the fundamental
cell biology of Plasmodium invasion and human RBCs, this work will stimulate new therapeutic and vaccine
approaches to treat one of the most important infectious diseases of humankind."
11101089,"ABSTRACT OF PARENT R01
Fibrosis is the final common pathway in chronic liver disease that leads to liver failure, and is characterized by
an imbalance of extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition and remodeling. There are currently no FDA-approved
therapies to target this endpoint of chronic liver disease. Moreover, there is a paucity of biomarkers that reflect
disease-specific pathways in patients. Development of new therapeutics and biomarkers for patients with hepatic
fibrosis is a critical unmet need. Our long-term goal is to develop antifibrotic therapies for the treatment of hepatic
fibrosis and to develop biomarkers to define the patient populations that would benefit most from these therapies.
Our prior studies discovered an antifibrotic target, the enzyme acid ceramidase (aCDase). Targeting aCDase
ameliorates fibrosis by inhibiting YAP/TAZ, key effectors of the Hippo pathway, and promotes ECM remodeling.
We developed a signature score of genes downregulated by ceramide, the Ceramide Responsiveness score
(CRS), and demonstrated that the CRS is increased in patients with advanced fibrosis. Despite the fact that
targeting aCDase in HSCs ameliorates activation in culture and ablating its expression prevents liver fibrosis in
vivo, chronic ceramide accumulation may have untoward side effects. The overall objective of the proposal is to
clarify the mechanisms by which ceramide regulates YAP/TAZ, ECM remodeling, and hepatic fibrosis. We also
seek to validate the CRS as a pathway-specific biomarker in patients with hepatic fibrosis. The rationale for this
project is that understanding the mechanisms of ceramide-mediated attenuation of HSC activation and hepatic
fibrosis will offer a strong scientific framework to facilitate the development of antifibrotic therapeutics and
biomarkers for patients. To achieve this objective, this proposal has three specific aims. In specific aim 1, we will
determine the mechanism by which ceramide regulates Hippo signaling. In specific aim 2, we will characterize
how ceramide regulates ECM remodeling. Specific aims 1 and 2 will be achieved by gain of function and loss of
function techniques in vitro and testing HSC-specific knockout mice. In specific aim 3, we will analyze the
correlation between the CRS, fibrosis stage, and fibrosis progression using deidentified human liver samples,
and will identify clinical characteristics that correlate with the CRS. The mechanistic understanding to be gained
from the successful completion of the proposed studies promises to reveal new targets for rational disease
modification in hepatic fibrosis, a disease with limited treatment options available. Furthermore, by clarifying
molecular mechanisms and defining a pathway-specific signature, our work will facilitate a personalized medicine
approach for patients with hepatic fibrosis."

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) perform dual roles in cells, acting as both destructive and constructive agents.
At high levels, intracellular ROS facilitate irreversible macromolecular damage and are associated with a range
of disease pathologies. At lower physiological levels, ROS play important roles in the activation of beneficial
signaling events through the reversible post-translational modification of cysteine and methionine residues.
Despite the emerging appreciation for ROS as constructive signaling agents, and the importance for functional
redox signaling in managing cellular ROS, relatively few redox-signaling pathways have been characterized.
Many proteins susceptible to oxidation have been cataloged. However, the consequences of oxidation and the
physiological outcomes have been established for only a limited number of these targets. We argue this central
knowledge gap limits larger efforts towards the development of effective therapeutics to help manage cellular
ROS. Since its inception, our research program has focused on broadening our knowledge of ROS-based
signaling events. Our overarching goal is to elucidate individual pathways activated by the modification of
protein cysteine and/or methionine by ROS. Our intent is to uncover and to characterize redox-signaling
components, including ROS sources, redox targets, and oxidation regulators, as well as the consequences
(outcomes) for signaling at the protein and physiological level. Our research efforts center on two focus areas:
(1) an analysis of the role for cysteine oxidation in managing ROS within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and
(2) the study of the consequences of protein methionine oxidation (MetO) formation and reduction. Our prior
work established that oxidation of a conserved cysteine in the Hsp70 BiP alters its chaperone activity to sustain
ER function under elevated ROS conditions. Our ongoing work intends to broaden our understanding of redox
signaling at the ER and BiP oxidation, answering the questions: What are the local endogenous sources of
ROS in the ER that are sensed by BiP? How does BiP oxidation influence known ER stress response
pathways? In addition, we intend to bolster the fundamental understanding of MetO formation and resolution
in cells, focusing in parallel on what we consider the most prominent gaps in our knowledge of MetO: What are
the physiological targets of MetO? What is the role for methionine sulfoxide reductases in regulating individual
protein MetO events throughout the cell? By answering these questions, we intend to provide insight into the
basic cell functions used to manage cellular ROS and avert cellular damage. We anticipate that our experience
and expertise, coupled with a diversity of personnel and scientific approaches, will allow us to make sustained
research progress over this MIRA award."
11100658,"Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Copper-Dependent Nutrient Signaling and Metabolism
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Akin to organic nutrients, such as oxygen, lipids, amino acids, and carbohydrates, the transition metal copper
(Cu) is an essential dietary nutrient for normal physiology and development. Decades of research highlight the
physiological and disease associated consequences of disrupting homeostatic mechanisms that ensure proper
Cu acquisition, storage, and distribution to Cu-dependent enzymes. However, phenotypes associated with
alterations in Cu availability cannot be fully explained by the limited number of enzymes that traditionally harness
the redox potential of Cu as a catalytic cofactor. Recent discoveries in Cu biology have revealed direct Cu binding
at non-catalytic sites within signaling molecules that modulate cell proliferation via the protein kinases MEK1/2,
lipid metabolism via the phosphodiesterase PDE3B, and nutrient recycling via the autophagic kinases ULK1/2.
The emergence of this new paradigm in nutrient sensing and protein regulation has established that Cu is a
critical mediator of intracellular signaling, provided evidence for the existence of molecular mechanisms for
sensing changes in Cu abundance, and expanded the contribution of Cu to cellular processes necessary for
adaptation to nutrient scarcity. This grant proposal will focus on the intersections between Cu homeostasis,
nutrient signaling, and metabolism by examining the interplay between mechanisms of Cu-sensing necessary
for cellular energy homeostasis and evaluating the necessity of Cu for metabolic flexibility under nutrient and
oxygen stress. Specifically, we will build on our novel findings from the past 5 years by elucidating mechanisms
of: i) Cu-controlled autophagy-lysosomal biogenesis and function, ii) Cu-mediated metabolic flexibility via direct
control of glycolytic flux, and iii) interconnectivity between mitochondrial Cu transport and cytosolic nutrient
sensing signaling pathways necessary for metabolism. By launching these three interconnected focus areas, we
will increase our fundamental knowledge of the molecular and cellular features of Cu-dependent enzymes
and cellular processes and enable therapeutic targeting of Cu-dependent disease vulnerabilities."
11100825,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Translation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) into proteins by the ribosome and the rest of the translation
machinery (TM) is a fundamental step in gene expression that is central to life. It is perhaps not surprising,
then, that the bacterial TM is a proven target for the development of new antibiotics and that many human
diseases have been causally linked to dysregulation of the human TM. Consequently, the mechanisms of
translation and translational control in bacteria and eukaryotes remain under intense investigation. Over the
past two decades, structural studies have revealed the large-scale structural rearrangements the TM
undergoes during protein synthesis. Unfortunately, the size, complexity, and conformational flexibility of the TM
have greatly impeded studies of these dynamics, significantly limiting our understanding of how they contribute
to the mechanisms of translation and translational control. Nonetheless, using a combination of single-
molecule fluorescence and structural techniques, we and others have characterized the dynamics of the core
steps of translation by the bacterial TM. Despite these accomplishments, critical gaps in our understanding
remain, particularly with regard to whether and how the dynamics of these core steps are modulated as part of
mechanisms of many biomedically important translational control strategies. To fill these gaps, we will use a
combination of single-molecule fluorescence, structural, and biochemical approaches to investigate how the
dynamics of the TM are steered to execute several fundamental translational control strategies that act during
initiation and elongation stages of translation in bacteria. In the case of translation initiation, we will investigate
how essential protein initiation factors (IFs) modulate the conformational dynamics of the ribosomal small
subunit and use conformational switching strategies to ensure the fidelity with which a ribosomal complex
correctly assembles at the start codon of the mRNA to be translated. In the case of translation elongation, we
will focus on ribosomal frameshifting and ribosome rescue. Ribosomal frameshifting, whereby the TM slips
backward or forward by one or more nucleotides on the mRNA, may be utilized at specific mRNA locations to
correct mutations that would otherwise result in production of an aberrant protein or to drive the synthesis of
multiple proteins from a single mRNA. Specialized TM components have evolved to induce frameshifting at
these specific locations, and our proposed studies of these features promise to reveal the still-elusive
mechanisms that underlie frameshifting. Using analogous approaches, we will also investigate how ribosome
rescue factors modulate the dynamics of the TM as part of the mechanisms through which they recognize and
rescue translationally compromised ribosomes. These studies will provide structure-based mechanistic models
of ribosome rescue systems that can inform the development of next generation small-molecule antibiotics.
Using a yeast in vitro translation system we have recently developed, we will expand these studies to include
eukaryotic-specific aspects of related translational control strategies in eukaryotes."

Obesity and cardiometabolic comorbidities are leading chronic conditions among middle-aged and older adults.
During the COVID-19 pandemic unhealthy lifestyle habits seem to worsen to a greater degree in those with
multiple chronic conditions, promoting weight gain and further widening health disparities. Middle to older aged
adults with underlying multimorbid conditions, especially minorities, are particularly vulnerable to the secondary
health effects of the pandemic and are the target population for this study. This study capitalizes on our
decades-long translational research on the efficacious Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) and DPP-based
Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) interventions; our extensive experience in using electronic health records
(EHR) for patient identification and monitoring; and our partnerships with multisector stakeholders in digital
health and wellness solutions. This multisite clinical trial uses a 2-stage sequential randomization design to test
the adaptive and nonadaptive augmentation of an EHR-integrated, validated base (GLB video) intervention
using problem solving treatment (PST), a proven behavior therapy. English/Spanish speaking adults (N=1029),
≥50 years with a body mass index ≥27 and ≥1 cardiometabolic conditions, will be randomized at baseline to
base intervention or waitlist control. Responders to the base intervention, defined by ≥3% weight loss at 6
weeks, will continue the base intervention; participants with <3% weight loss or missing weight data (i.e.,
nonresponders) will be re-randomized to continue the base intervention alone or augmented with PST
coaching via videoconference. Waitlist participants will be re-randomized after a 12-week control period to
receive the base or the augmented intervention, but without tailoring based on early weight loss. The base
intervention will use EHR-integrated delivery of the self-directed GLB videos, 1 per week for 12 weeks,
followed by digital behavior change and motivational messages. The augmented intervention includes base
intervention + PST videoconference coaching. All participants will receive a tablet, wireless weight scale, and
wearable activity tracker and will be followed for 52 weeks after baseline randomization. Aim 1 is to
demonstrate intervention effects on weight loss, behavior change, and patient-reported outcomes. We
hypothesize: (1) the augmented intervention will be more effective than the base intervention both among early
nonresponders to the base intervention (adaptive) and among participants in the waitlist group (nonadaptive) at
52 weeks; (2) the adaptive augmented intervention will be more efficacious than the base intervention and
more efficacious than the waitlist control group at 12 weeks. Aim 2 is to identify predictors of clinically
significant (5%) weight loss for individual patients, using sociodemographic, clinical and behavioral
engagement characteristics. The proposed interventions are poised to have immediate and widespread impact
on access, reach, delivery, effectiveness, scalability and sustainability. This study, if successful, will point the
way toward an inexpensive, scalable intervention that would likely be adopted by insurers."
11102692,"SUMMARY
Physical activity (PA) is a cornerstone for enhancing overall health, reducing the risk of chronic diseases, and
improving the quality of life for individuals of all ages. Despite the health benefits of PA, only 23% of adults in
the United States meet the recommended guidelines for both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities.
Recommended PA levels are not equally distributed across Americans; there are disparities in PA levels among
different racial and ethnic groups. Socioeconomic barriers, environmental factors, and systemic racism
contribute to lower levels of PA in minoritized communities. Dr. Brennan Rhodes-Bratton aims to become an
independent health equity researcher with expertise in chronic disease prevention through rigorous mixed-
methods. She seeks to investigate the interplay of structural, environmental, and behavioral determinants of
chronic disease using a theory-driven approach to learn how to best support PA improvement by incorporating
gentrification and health habitus as central to discovering solutions to the PA health disparities. Aligning with
the purpose of PA-21-071, this diversity supplement extends the research from the parent award, Community
Walks Clinical Trial, to specifically explore the sustainability of a multi-level PA intervention among residents of
public housing developments. The diversity supplement aims to estimate the confounding and potential
moderating effects of gentrification and health habitus on moderate-intensity physical activity among
participants across all four arms of the Community Walks intervention trial. This supplement will evaluate
publicly available neighborhood-level gentrification indicators, individual-level psychosocial factors, and health
behaviors that act as a proxy for gentrification and health habitus from the Community Walks baseline, 12-
month, and 24-month follow-up surveys. Countless studies have sought to improve physical activity in
sedentary populations by focusing on individual factors like motivation, attitudes, and self-efficacy. However,
the improvements in activity levels achieved by these interventions often do not persist beyond the initial
intervention period. One potential reason for this lack of sustainability is the need for more consideration of
environmental factors that promote physical activity. Consequently, there is a growing emphasis on the
complex interplay of environmental and social factors that influence physical activity to develop multi-level
strategies to better tailor interventions. Both the parent grant and this diversity supplement emphasize the
importance of the interplay between structural, environmental, and behavioral determinants of health by
developing a multi-level intervention (parent grant) and centering the social process of gentrification and the
theoretical construct of health habitus in the study design (supplement). Our analysis will determine whether
gentrification and health habitus have moderation effects on the four intervention arms of the Community
Walks clinical trial. This supplement will set up the candidate for success as an independent health equity
researcher with expertise in mixed-method study design and chronic disease prevention."
11103412,"tRNA activity can drive pathological processes in a codon-dependent manner, but these mechanisms have never been 
explored in the context of cancer vulnerability. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) can regulate protein synthesis dynamics by 
determining translation velocity, shaping mRNA translation profiles. Thus, regulation of tRNA metabolism is critical for 
cellular homeostasis, and misregulation of tRNA modification pathways is associated with human diseases. For example, the 
tRNA methyltransferase complex METTL1-WDR4 catalyzes the N7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification of a tRNA subset 
and is dysregulated in human cancers. METTL1-WDR4-induced m7G tRNA methylation is essential to control tRNA folding 
and stability, which affects the translation of mRNAs harboring relevant cognate codons. Multiple lines of evidence show 
that METTL1, the catalytic subunit, functions as an oncogene through the stabilization and concomitant accumulation of 
tRNAs, showing that reprogramming of mRNA translation via changes in the tRNA pool can contribute to oncogenesis. For 
instance, the neuronal development associated tRNA isoform tRNA-Arg-TCT-4-1 possesses oncogenic characteristics and is 
highly elevated in multiple types of human cancer. On the other hand, failure to deposit m7G leads to the degradation of 
tRNAs that have been under-modified, as observed in the Rapid tRNA Decay pathway (RTD) in yeast. Despite the growing 
awareness of the importance of tRNA quality control in normal physiology, it is unclear whether an analogous RTD or other 
quality control pathways that govern tRNA function are altered in mammalian systems or cancer. Hence, the proposal goals 
are two-fold: 1) what are the mechanisms underlying the removal of m7G hypomodified tRNAs? and 2) Is the METTL1 
substrate tRNA-Arg-TCT-4-1 a potential cancer vulnerability? First, we aim to unveil the pathways and mechanisms that 
govern the quality control of tRNAs in cancer. To achieve this, we will measure changes in m7G-modified tRNA levels using 
Hybridization Chain Reaction RNA FISH and monitor translation efficiencies of fluorescent reporters enriched with m7G 
tRNA decoded codons after whole genome perturbations. Since lack of m7G modification leads to tRNA degradation, we 
hypothesize that knocking out quality control factors may rescue m7G tRNA levels. Secondly, we aim to test RNA-Arg-TCT- 
4-1 inhibition as a potential cancer therapeutic approach using sarcomas as a model. We will develop strategies to target and 
inhibit this novel oncogenic mediator, starting with antisense oligonucleotides. Mechanistically, we seek to understand how 
a single tRNA isoform can support malignant phenotypes and further understand how protein translation is dysregulated in 
sarcoma. Successful completion of the proposed work is expected to provide insight into the fundamental basis for 
understanding the role of m7G tRNA modification and its regulation in normal and malignant growth."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for U.S women, annually killing >400,000 women.
Compared to whites, non-Hispanic Black and Latina women are at higher CVD risk. Despite the burden of CVD
in women, risk factors specific to women are understudied and thus not considered in current CVD risk
prediction or prevention strategies. Early detection of subclinical disease is key to CVD risk stratification and
prevention. Since prenatal and postpartum care is the sole health care access point for most U.S. women,
pregnancy represents a critical opportunity to measure CVD risk and implement innovative strategies to
address this critical gap in women’s health care. Furthermore, CVD risk factor trajectories begin in utero and in
early life, so pregnancy is also an opportunity to identify CVD risk in children. Our long-range goal is to
identify and disseminate obstetric care practices that mitigate CVD risk for women and their children. The
objective of this prospective, multicenter study is to estimate CVD risk in healthy and medically complicated
pregnant women and their infants. We will also examine the relationships among personal, social, and
ecological factors and CVD risk for 3 years postpartum. Our primary outcomes are maternal and infant
central pulse wave velocity (PWV), a validated measure of arterial stiffness (vascular aging) that predicts CVD,
independent of other established CVD risk factors. We will enroll a cohort 840 pregnant women of diverse
race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status: 420 healthy and 420 women with preeclampsia, gestational diabetes,
and/or suspected fetal growth restriction. We will measure maternal and infant PWV, cardio-metabolic (e.g.,
blood pressure, lipids, adiposity, HbA1c) and inflammatory (e.g., hs-CRP, IL-6, adiponectin) markers of CVD
risk, and assess personal, social, and ecological factors at 34-40 weeks’ gestation, delivery, 6 months, 18
months, and 3 years. The study aims are the following: 1) Measure arterial stiffness by PWV during and after
pregnancy; 2) Measure infant/child PWV following healthy and complicated pregnancies; and 3)
Identify maternal and infant modifiable risk factors associated with CVD risk measured by PWV. To date, no
studies have longitudinally measured CVD risk in pregnant women and their infants, nor ascertained the effect
of biologic, personal, social, and/or ecological factors on CVD risk. Using a noninvasive measure of arterial
stiffness, we propose to determine CVD risk in a cohort of mother-infant dyads. Our interdisciplinary study
team of experts in CVD, high-risk pregnancy, exercise and sports physiology, CVD epidemiology, public
health, and cardiology are well poised to complete the proposed aims by using a synthesis of expertise to
achieve our common, shared goal of mitigate CVD risk for women and their children. We are proposing an
innovative paradigm shift in the goals of prenatal care to use pregnancy as a time in a woman’s life, particularly
if she is at high risk for CVD, to identify and mitigate early markers of CVD for herself and her offspring."
11119733,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common genetic disease caused by a defect in the CF transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR). The pathogenesis of CF lung disease is unclear and controversial, at least partially due to
lack of studies in an appropriate CF animal model. In addition, most studies regarding the pathogenesis rely on
data from cultured human diseased large proximal airways, such as tracheal and bronchial tissue. However,
pathological and clinical data suggest that the disease is initiated in small airways with a diameter <2mm.
Iowa group has engineered pigs with deletion or mutation of CFTR. These pigs mimic human CF, including
development of spontaneous infections and obstruction of airways with mucus and inflammatory cells. This
model provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the pathogenesis of CF lung disease. Our
objective for this study is to investigate how loss of CFTR leads to host defense defects in CF small airway
epithelia and if viral vector mediated delivery of CFTR cDNA to CF small airways will rescue host defense
defects. Our overall hypothesis is that AAV4 mediated delivery of CFTR will correct ASL properties and restore
host defense function of small airway epithelium in CF. In Aim 1, we will use AAV4 to deliver CFTR cDNA in
cultured small airway epithelial cells from CF pigs and examine ASL properties including pH and viscosity and
bacterial killing abilities. In Aim 2, we will use human small airway epithelia from CF patients to test the
hypothesis. In Aim 3, we will examine the cellular tropism and efficiency of AAV4 mediated gene delivery to
small airway epithelium in live pigs and human lung explant. The proposed studies will lead to a better
understanding of the CFTR-mediated host defense mechanisms and illustrate a potentially important yet
previously underappreciated role of small airway epithelial cells in pathogenesis of CF lung disease."
11120032,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Life support with extracorporeal circulation through a membrane oxygenator (ECMO) is a
mainstay of advanced critical care. However, clotting in the ECMO circuit and bleeding from the
patient are the major complications, accounting for morbidity and mortality in 30% of patients.
Surface–based coatings are available, but still require systemic anticoagulation because these
surfaces do not prevent platelet adhesion and activation. We have developed a nonthrombogenic
surface which prevents platelet activation at the surface. This could eliminate the need for
systemic anticoagulation and prevent major bleeding and circuit clotting complications. The
surface is based on nitric oxide (NO), which is the mechanism of surface anticoagulation of the
normal endothelium. The chemistry, coating, NO generation, and effectiveness have been tested
in preliminary studies. This research will refine the nitric oxide surface anticoagulation system
(NOSA), and demonstrate effectiveness compared to systemic anticoagulation. The results will
apply to nonthrombogenic surfaces for other extracorporeal devices such as hemodialysis,
hemofiltration, and cardiopulmonary bypass."
11119107,"Project Summary
Patients with valvular heart disease (VHD) requiring surgical intervention are at a high risk of adverse events. Notably, in
the days following surgery, post-operative delirium is common, extends hospitalization, and may lead to long-term
cognitive decline. These surgical patients are also at high risk for atrial and ventricular arrhythmias during and after
hospitalization, although knowledge about the time course and burden of arrhythmias in the post-hospital setting is
limited. Over time, the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network (CTSN) has developed a unique platform of research in
VHD that includes cutting-edge trials in patients with functional and degenerative mitral regurgitation, including mitral
valve prolapse, as well as aortic stenosis and tricuspid valve disease.
In this application, the Network proposes to build on this research agenda in several ways. First, we plan to incorporate
rhythm monitoring into the soon to be launched EPIC trial, which evaluates the impact of left posterior pericardiotomy on
preventing POAF during hospitalization (<5 days of surgery) in patients undergoing surgery for VHD and/or coronary
artery disease. The EPIC trial offers an opportunity to capture 30-day post-hospital discharge arrhythmia burden in
patients with VHD, both those with atrial fibrillation in the immediate post-operative period and those without but who
may be at risk for developing de novo arrhythmias. The proposed research should give new insights into the duration of
the risk period for these VHD patients, and whether the post-hospitalization care of these patients needs to be modified.
Second, we will leverage our embolic protection device trial (the EMPRO trial) of adults undergoing high-risk mitral and
aortic valve surgery by focusing on novel risk factors, including circadian rhythm and sleep disruption and accelerated
epigenetic age, for post-operative delirium. Third, we will identify mitral regurgitation (MR) phenogroups applying
machine learning and artificial intelligence to clinical and imaging data from hundreds of patients followed in our several
mitral valve (MV) trials. Categorization of patients into high and low risk phenogroups will help to identify individuals
for MV intervention at earlier stages of their disease than is currently recommended in clinical practice guidelines.
Finally, we will use national datasets, Use national datasets to evaluate annual procedural volumes and outcomes of TEER
and MVr in patients with MVP, to assess predictors of post-interventional outcomes (death, HF hospitalization, valve re-
interventions, ventricular arrhythmias, sudden death) and identify whether historically under-represented patient
subgroups are at risk of worse clinical outcomes. We will characterize pre-operative variations in diagnostic testing,
cardiovascular referrals, and electrophysiological procedures among patients who undergo surgical MVr for MVP and
identify disparities in use among different groups (sex, race, ethnicity, rural location and socioeconomic status)."
11119170,"Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) and Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) are two neurodegenerative
diseases characterized by cognitive impairments that include executive dysfunction, visual-spatial processing
difficulties and impaired working memory. Cognitive impairments are among the most debilitating symptoms of
these diseases, often leading to institutionalization and severe decline in health. In PD, cognitive symptoms are
often present at diagnosis, but can appear over the course of the disease. In DLB, cognitive changes appear
first followed by the development of motor parkinsonism. Both diseases, collectively termed Lewy body
dementias, are pathologically characterized by aggregates containing the protein α-synuclein, called Lewy
pathology. Lewy pathology is found in brain areas important for cognition including the cortex and
hippocampus where it correlates with cognitive decline. Genetic variations in the gene, GBA1, also associate
with LBDs. GBA1 encodes for glucocerebrosidase an enzyme that metabolizes glucosylceramide. Mutations in
glucocerebrosidase reduce its enzyme activity. Up to 12% of PD cases involved genetic variations in GBA1.
The GBA1L444P mutation, which represents about 35% of all PD-GBA1 mutations, increases risk of cognitive
decline in PD by 5X. We have found that mice heterozygous for GBA1L444P show impaired performance in
behavioral tasks of hippocampal function, and reduced synaptic markers in the hippocampus but not other
brain regions. In addition, GBA1L444P heterozygous mice injected with pre-formed α-synuclein fibrils to induce
formation of inclusions from endogenous α-synuclein, show more abundant inclusions in the hippocampus
compared to wild type mice. In addition, we and others have found that the lipid, glucosylsphingosine but not
glucosylceramide is increased in GBA1L444P heterozygous mice, suggesting this lipid causes pathology and
should be the target of PD-GBA1 therapies. The combined impact of increased GlcSph and enhanced α-syn
aggregation in the hippocampus could be a mechanism by which cognition is impaired in LBDs, which will be
explored in this proposal. First, we will determine if glucosylsphingosine is elevated in brain tissue from
individuals with PD-GBA1 and controls. We will also utilize a model of human α-synuclein aggregation to
determine if pathologic α-synuclein causes changes in glycosphingolipid metabolism in hippocampal and
cortical brain regions. Because reduced glucocerebrosidase has been shown to impair lysosome function, we
will use primary hippocampal neurons to determine if glucosylsphingosine impairs lysosome activity, leading to
a build-up of abnormal α-synuclein. Finally, we will use independent methods to reduce GlcSph in GBA1
L444P heterozygous and wild type mice with and without α-synuclein pathology to determine if decreasing this
lipid prevents defects in hippocampal physiology and related behaviors. Overall, this project will help determine
mechanisms by which GBA1L444P contributes to cognitive decline and help identify therapeutic strategies to
prevent development of cognitive symptoms."
11121520,"Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) is the leading cause of death in epilepsy. Many SUDEP cases
had genetic variants linked to cardiac arrhythmias, particularly Long QT Syndrome (LQTS). Our lab and others
showed that LQT2 patients are at a >2-fold higher risk of epilepsy, compared to genotype negative family
members. LQT2 is caused by KCNH2 variants that encode a K+ channel protein (Kv11.1), which produces K+
current (IKr). It is critical for cardiac repolarization, stabilizes the neuronal resting membrane potential, and
suppresses repetitive firing. People with KCNH2-mediated epilepsy and LQT2 need safe and effective anti-
seizure medications (ASMs). A critical barrier is the lack of a clinically relevant animal model of LQT2 with
epilepsy. We will develop the first translational model of Kcnh2-mediated epilepsy, SUDEP, and LQT2. As LQT2
patients with KCNH2 pore-domain variants are at the highest risk of seizures, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate
rabbits with a heterozygous frameshift mutation in the Kcnh2 pore-domain (Kcnh2(+/mut)). This model has superior
construct validity. Due to rodent vs. human differences in cardiac electrical function, and unphysiological Kcnh2
expression patterns, present models are not appropriate for translational studies of Kcnh2-mediated neuro-
cardiac pathologies. Many rodent models fail to reproduce the natural progression of clinical epilepsy, include
non-seizure related neuronal damage, require triggers that are not physiologically relevant, and have low
predictive validity for ASM screening. Rabbits are established models for drug testing, and studying seizures,
arrhythmias, and sudden death. In contrast to rodents, neuronal cell-types are similar in humans and rabbits.
R61: External Face Validation: Using quantifiable and clinically relevant endpoints, we will test if Kcnh2(+/mut)
rabbits reproduce the neuro-cardiac pathologies seen in LQT2 patients with epilepsy. Preliminary data indicates
that we generated a clinically-relevant rabbit model of Kcnh2-mediated epilepsy, SUDEP, and LQT2. There is
reduced Kv11.1 expression in the brain and heart, QTc prolongation, spontaneous noncardiogenic epileptic
seizures, and spontaneous seizure-mediated sudden death. R33: Despite LQT2 patients being at a high risk of
epilepsy and SUDEP, there are no established ASMs for LQT2 patients with epilepsy. We demonstrated that
LQT2 patients are at an increased risk of arrhythmias when on vs. off ASMs, particularly Na+ channel blocking
ASMs (e.g., phenytoin). External Face Validation: (1) We will demonstrate that myocytes and cortical neurons
from Kcnh2(+/mut) rabbits have reduced IKr and are hyperexcitable. (2) Similar to LQT2 patients, cellular and in
vivo assays will test if phenytoin has adverse cardiac effects in Kcnh2(+/mut) rabbits. Preliminary data indicates
phenytoin blocks IKr and causes a larger increase in QTc in Kcnh2(+/mut) vs. WT rabbits, which suggests predictive
validity of our model. Impact: We will develop a model of Kcnh2-mediated epilepsy, SUDEP, and LQT2 that
reproduces human LQT2 neuro-cardiac pathologies. It will provide a platform for identifying effective and safe
ASMs to reduce seizures and SUDEP in LQT2, and complements our research using the LQTS patient registry."
11118067,"West Virginia (WV), the only state entirely within Appalachia, has the highest all-cause mortality rate in
the nation (2022 data), the highest prevalence of diabetes, obesity, and (by far) the highest drug overdose
mortality rate. Yet, WV is among the states with the fewest clinical trials and rural residents (constituting
nearly half the population) are consistently underrepresented in clinical studies. We seek to change all of
this through implementation of our network, West Virginia Rural Roots to Research (WVR3). The West
Virginia Clinical and Translational Research Institute (WVCTSI), will serve as the WVR3 hub, leveraging past
experience as a network hub for clinical trials and our long-standing partnership with the West Virginia
Practice Based Research Network (WVPBRN). Five clinical trial sites located in rural areas with some of the
highest mortality rates in the state have been selected. The overall goal of WVR3 is to expand impactful
clinical trials - those that result in WV primary care practice modifications, changes in health behaviors,
and ultimately improvement in health outcomes. We will accomplish this goal through the following
specific aims. Specific Aim 1. Establish a comprehensive infrastructure that optimizes the efficiency,
coordination, and quality of clinical studies. Using implementation science methodology, we will
optimize clinical trial performance in WVR3 sites through defining clinic workflows, identifying efficiencies,
and incorporating feedback to improve trial implementation processes. Strategies to ease burden on sites
and study participants include centralized regulatory support, a mobile clinical trials unit, regionally based
research coordinators (""Flex"" Coordinators), and use of electronic consent and telemedicine. A sitespecific
performance dashboard will be established, and a Site Performance Committee will review site
performance metrics monthly. Specific Aim 2. Effectively communicate with participating communities
- before, during, and after trial implementation. Community forums will be conducted in all WVR3
communities, ensuring that community members have input as to the types of clinical trials that are
selected. The community's perspective will guide community education and trial messaging. Specific Aim
3. Ensure trial results positively impact primary care practice. lmpactful clinical studies inform clinical
practice when effective collaboration and trusted platforms exist that not only communicate relevant
research results to healthcare providers but afford discussion of effective strategies for integrating
research findings into medical practice. WVR3 will leverage the Community of Practice that already exists
through WVCTSI Project ECHO, an effective platform where primary care providers discuss relevant resu Its,
implications of those results, and share best practices for integrating new findings into their clinic, thereby
resulting in a sustainable learning health system.

3-5). The final goal is to realize a fully functional integrated system with interoperable leads that will be
community-supported technology platform. The Technology Integration and Dissemination (TID) Core will
support this goal by facilitating the interconnection between the NEST Projects to realize a logical integration
plan. NEST 1-2 and NEST 3-5 will run in parallel and achieve module level testing before beginning system
integration. Then NEST 1-2 will result in a fully integrated IPG with external charger and controller. Final
integration will involve testing different leads and lead configurations with the IPG system.
 The TID Core will also spearhead the Center’s multi-pronged approach to achieve broad dissemination of
CARSS technology. The Center will also employ a collaborative approach, working with other HORNET Centers
to facilitate dissemination.
 CARSS will share content different venues and formats including a newsletter, social media posts (LinkedIn),
articles (include special issue contributions), reports, presentations (at meetings, conferences, and seminars),
short courses (including recorded and downloadable training modules and tutorials), and on-site training events.
The Center will maintain a website, wiki, and online repositories, each providing access to different types of users
and addressing different user needs. CARSS will also coordinate with the SPARC Data and Resource Center
to share developed materials. The open-source license strategy will allow open collaboration, facilitating
derivative hardware and software products."

 The mammalian secretory pathway regulates a cell’s extracellular interactions by making most signals
and receptors that moderate communication. Furthermore, it makes cell adhesion molecules and the
extracellular matrix components. Indeed it makes most proteins needed for a cell to interact with its
extracellular environment, which includes ~⅓ of their protein-coding genes in the human genome. The pathway
has hundreds of machinery proteins used for synthesizing and trafficking secreted proteins, but each of these
have their unique role in the process. However, for the ~8000 protein products of the secretory pathway, it
remains unclear what machinery is needed for each one. To further complicate this, each tissue expresses its
own subset of genes for the secretory pathway. Understanding the organization of the pathway and the
interactions between the secretory pathway machinery and secreted protein products is of considerable
importance since many diseases involve changes in the abundance of secreted and/or membrane proteins,
and these are not always accompanied by changes in mRNA. That is, the secretory pathway itself is regulating
changes in hormone secretion, managing ER stress, or amyloid formation. Thus, there is a fundamental need
to understand (1) what the secretory pathway machinery does, (2) which secreted and membrane proteins rely
upon it, (3) how the hundreds of machinery proteins work together, and (4) what regulates their functions. All of
these items require systems-level experiments, tools, and analyses to fully understand. Here we are
developing such resources for the community to answer fundamental questions. In this work, we are mapping
out all of the secretory pathway machinery and detailing their functions. We describe their functions
mathematically, and build computational models to account for their concerted functions, even for individual
tissues and cell types. Furthermore we are developing software and algorithms to help analyze the models and
use them to diagnose the molecular bases underlying secretory disorders. We are further developing and
deploying experimental techniques to more fully identify all of the secretory machinery proteins needed to
facilitate the production of each specific secreted or membrane protein, and will use those techniques to
identify these interactions for liver-secreted proteins. Finally, we are using genomics and systems biology
techniques to unravel the regulatory mechanisms controlling the tissue-specific expression of the secretory
pathway. Through this, valuable resources will be developed and shared with the community to make it easier
to study the secretory pathway as a biomolecular system."
11120599,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell membrane proteins regulate a multitude of cellular processes that are vital for organismal health. The
extracellular domain is critical for ligand binding and signal transduction of the full-length receptor. In addition,
approximately 2% of cell surface proteins undergo ectodomain shedding to release their extracellular domain.
Ectodomain shedding may terminate the function of the full-length receptor and/or lead to the generation of either
a soluble decoy receptor or an active ligand. The Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), a type 1 membrane protein
central to the etiology of Alzheimer’s disease, is one such cell surface protein that undergoes ectodomain
shedding to generate various soluble APP (sAPP) fragments. Despite the known effects of the APP ectodomain
on cellular and cognitive functions and the potential applications to disease, the precise molecular mechanisms
mediating the function of APP ectodomain remains largely enigmatic due to the focus of the field on the Amyloid-
β region of APP. Thus, the goal of the lab is to elucidate the normal physiological functions of the extracellular
domain of the Amyloid Precursor Protein. Our approaches are designed to address the mechanistic gaps in
knowledge by leveraging our recent discovery that sAPP functions as a ligand for the GABA type B Receptor
(GABABR) and our recent identification of Phosphoglycerate Mutase Family Member 5 (PGAM5), a mitochondrial
serine/threonine protein phosphatase, as a novel candidate interactor of the APP ectodomain. One line of
research will elucidate the cellular responses of non-neuronal cells to sAPP and GABA B Receptor modulation,
identify signaling pathways downstream of the sAPP and GABA B Receptor interaction, and determine
mechanisms involved in the positive regulation of GABA B Receptor signaling by sAPP. A second line of research
will investigate the cellular conditions and subcellular compartments in which APP and PGAM5 come into
contact, the molecular basis of the APP and PGAM5 interaction (i.e. binding affinities, critical binding domains),
and the consequences of PGAM5 on APP phosphorylation and proteolytic processing. The work in these studies
will generate fundamental knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the protein-protein interactions
of the APP ectodomain and the cellular consequences of these interactions across different cell types."

This project aims to better understand the molecular mechanisms of HIV spread through cell-cell contact
across a virological synapse (VS), a specialized structure formed between HIV infected cells and target cells.
We have developed a novel flow cytometry assay for quantifying and purifying infected cell-target cell pairs.
We have generated infected producer cells that stably express ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) enzymes
localized to different subcellular compartments. Upon addition of hydrogen peroxide and biotin-phenol, APEX
generates short-lived BP radicals that covalently biotinylate proteins and RNAs within a few nanometers of the
enzyme. We will use APEX localized to nucleus, cytoplasm, ER, plasma membrane, and mitochrondria to
provide a robust analysis of how host and viral proteins and RNAs are regulated by VS formation. The
successful completion of this grant will identify determinants of the VS formation and its composition, identify
changes to host cell proteins following VS formation with an emphasis on RNA binding proteins, and determine
how host and viral RNAs are regulated by cell-cell contact.
Aim 1: Identify determinants and composition of virological synapse (VS) formation.
Aim 2: Determine how VS formation affects protein abundance and localization within infected cells, with an
emphasis on cellular RNA binding proteins.
Aim 3: Determine how cell-cell signaling during VS formation impacts the RNA regulatory landscape of
infected cells."
11119039,"Nerve injury (i.e. neuropathic) pain is not well characterized within the Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) population; a recent pilot study to improve pain phenotyping in oral cancer patients found that the majority of patients report at least one neuropathic pain descriptor, such as “burning” or “pins and needles”. In the presence of nerve injury and neuropathic pain, it has been demonstrated that adrenergic plasticity, as well as sympathetic sprouting, occur, leading to sympathetic-sensory coupled pain. We have previously demonstrated that aggressive tongue tumor growth drives nerve injury in tongue-innervating trigeminal ganglia neurons (TGNs) as well as tongue-innervating sympathetic postganglionic neurons in the superior cervical ganglia (SCG). Additionally, in pursuit of the parent grant Specific Aim 2, using single-cell PCR, we found an increase in alpha1-adrenergic receptor gene expression in tongue-innervating TGNs from tumor-bearing mice compared to sham. Furthermore, preliminary data collection by the candidate showed adrenergic sensitivity in tongue-innervating TGNs using Ca2+ imaging; norepinephrine (NE, 10μM) evoked a Ca2+ transient in the majority of tumor mice compared to sham; this NE-evoked response in neurons from tumor-bearing mice was blocked by alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, doxazosin mesylate. While the tumor is still present and cancer-induced nociception is not dependent on sympathetic signaling in its entirety, these data suggest a prominent role for sympathetic neurotransmission in oral cancer pain. The hypothesis for this proposal is that nerve injury secondary to oral cancer dysregulates adrenergic signaling in tongue-innervating nociceptive neurons exacerbating cancer pain. To test this hypothesis using preclinical mouse models, we will determine whether cancer-induced mandibular nerve injury is necessary for the development of adrenergic sensitivity as well as determine whether mandibular nerve injury alone is sufficient for the development of adrenergic sensitivity in the presence of oral cancer, using single-cell PCR, microfluorimetry/electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry. We will also assess the contribution of adrenergic sensitivity in trigeminal afferents to spontaneous orofacial pain behavior (Grimace, and grooming), and leverage adrenergic pharmacology to augment or reduce nociceptive behaviors induced by a model of oral cancer or trigeminal nerve injury."
11119166,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Stroke is not just an event but a chronic illness with tremendous impact.
Every year, 5 million people die of stroke, and another 5 million are left with disabling impairments of cognitive
and physical function. Progress in the acute treatment of stroke has reduced the number of patients who die but
also increased the number of survivors, who along with their family members are faced with many challenges
over the long term. These challenges range from cognitive and physical impairment to psychosocial and
existential suffering. One third of stroke survivors develop cognitive impairment due to vascular contributions to
cognitive impairment & dementia (VCID), which may worsen over time due to concomitant Alzheimer disease
and related dementia (ADRD) or immunological processes triggered by the stroke itself. Post-stroke cognitive
impairment reduces a patient’s ability to participate in rehabilitation and increases caregiver burden. Over 1 in 3
stroke survivors suffer advanced symptoms of pain, anxiety and depression, and these symptoms can become
more frequent or intense in those who are actively dying. As families face immense grief and prognostic
uncertainty, clinicians need to help them maintain hope but also understand the severity of the disease, so that
they can effectively discuss treatment options across the range of possible outcomes. About 1 in 3 patients die
in the hospital, most of them after a decision to withdraw life-sustaining treatments, such as mechanical
ventilation, artificial nutrition, and hydration. For those who survive a severe stroke, most patients and families
face a completely different reality with new social roles, high symptom burden, and frequent rehospitalization.
Therefore, we urgently need interventions to support patients and families as they grapple with often conflicting
realities of recovery, grief, adaptation and treatment decisions that continue for months or even years after the
stroke. We propose a randomized clinical trial of a “Longitudinal Transdisciplinary Neuropalliative Care Support”
(Lotus) team that follows patients and their families from early in their hospital course through six months and
provides targeted support as well as helping them ensure that treatment is line with their values. This team is led
by a specially trained Lotus nurse who works with a team of mental health, spiritual care, social work and
neuropalliative care providers, who will support the patient and family through a combination of in-person and
tele-health appointments. The team will implement complementary activities to enhance palliative care
integration into stroke care: awareness, assistance, adjustment, acceptance and alignment. We hypothesize that
this intervention compared to usual care will (1) improve psychological outcomes such as depression or anxiety
for patients and families and (2) increase ‘hospital-free days’ for patients and improve goal concordance,
meaning that patients will be more likely to receive the type of medical care that is consistent with their personal
goals and preferences. Finally, we will (3) conduct a mixed methods evaluation to explore barriers and facilitators
to future implementation and dissemination."
10805421,"Invasive and proliferative phenotypes are vital cancer hallmarks, and these phenotypes are distinguished
by the fact that invasive cells lead the path for dividing cells as the tumor grows. Glioblastoma multiforme
(GBM) treatments, specifically chemotherapies, fail because cancer cells invade and proliferate beyond tumor
boundaries. But neither phenotypes can be tracked with existing imaging methods. We will develop 1H/23Na
MRSI technology to differentiate and track these phenotypes, and which will have major clinical relevance.
 Compared to normal cells, cancer cells possess unique chemical and electrical properties. Interstitial fluid's
acidity and salinity are crucial for cell survival. Many cellular mechanisms help regulate essential cellular
functions by maintaining hydrogen ions (H+) and sodium ions (Na+) in the interstitial milieu, which is saline and
near neutral pH. Research from us, and others, reveal that acidity and salinity of interstitial and intracellular
spaces are altered in cancer, e.g., sodium-hydrogen exchanger 1 (NHE1), which aids H+ efflux and Na+ influx,
is upregulated in GBMs and contributes to altered transmembrane ion distributions.
 Research on GBM models reveals an acidic interstitial fluid, vital for reshaping the interstitial matrix for
cancer cell proliferation and to guide cancer cell invasion. Similar work on human-derived GBMs shows that
interstitial Na+ is also altered, but this change supports a depolarized cell membrane - vital for cancer cell
proliferation. These novel results suggest that the combination of interstitial pH (pHo) and transmembrane Na+
gradient (ΔNa+m) maps can help generate independent biomarkers of invasive and proliferative phenotypes.
 While 1H-MRI with gadolinium agents tracks tumor size, we and others have shown that agents with other
lanthanides can be used for pHo mapping with 1H-MRSI and ΔNa+m mapping with 23Na-MRSI. These 1H/23Na
maps are currently obtained individually, requiring lengthy acquisitions with separate agent injections. To
explore the relationship between dysregulated pH and electrolyte imbalances regulating cancer cell invasion
and proliferation, pHo and ΔNa+m maps must be spatiotemporally compared during tumor growth/therapy.
 Our goal is to test the hypothesis that invasive cells lead dividing cells as the tumor grows, and explore
how their patterns change with treatment. First, we will interleave 1H and 23Na acquisitions to enable rapid pHo
and ΔNa+m mapping with a single agent infusion. Next, proliferative and invasive maps from combination of pHo
and ΔNa+m maps will be validated in nodular vs. invasive patient -derived xenografts (PDXs) using IHC and
ICP-MS. For clinical relevance, we will test potential of NHE1 inhibitor as an adjuvant chemotherapy to improve
GBM outcome. We will compare pHo and ΔNa+m maps with two different therapies (i.e., first-line GBM standard
of care chemotherapy temozolomide alone vs. temozolomide + cariporide) to capture fates of invasive and
proliferative phenotypes in nodular vs. invasive PDXs."
11119931,"7. Project Summary/Abstract
Adolescence is an “age of risk” for the emergence of first onset of bipolar spectrum disorders (BSD). Despite
their prevalence and public health significance, major unanswered questions exist regarding the mechanisms
involved in vulnerability to BSDs. BSDs are associated with hypersensitivity to reward and elevated reward-
related brain function. However, research has not yet tested whether chronically high reward responsivity (RR)
or increases in RR development during adolescence, beyond baseline RR, predicts first onset of BSD. A
separate literature documents circadian rhythm disruption in BSDs, and social rhythm disruption (SRD) can
trigger BSD episodes. Yet, research has not tested whether baseline circadian dysregulation, chronic social
and circadian rhythm disruptions, or increases in these rhythm disruptions during adolescence predict onset of
BSD. Further, circadian and reward approaches to BSDs mostly have proceeded in parallel. However, we and
others have proposed integrated reward-circadian models of BSDs based on evidence the two systems
influence each other and interact to affect mood functioning. When dysregulated, reward and circadian system
signaling may combine to form a positive feedback loop, whereby dysregulation in one system exacerbates
dysregulation in the other. This proposal is the first systematic test of a novel, integrated reward-circadian
model for first onset of BSD. We will use an innovative biobehavioral high-risk design to examine bidirectional
relationships between multiple indices and domains (monetary, social) of RR and multiple indices of social and
circadian rhythms and their joint prediction of first onset of BSD and increases in bipolar symptoms. Three
hundred twenty 14-16 year old participants (Ps) will complete a prospective 3-year longitudinal study. Ps with
no prior BSD will be selected along the entire dimension of self-reported RR, with oversampling at the high tail
of the dimension in order to increase the likelihood of BSD onsets. At Times 1-6, every 6 months, Ps will
complete assessments of reward-relevant and SRD life events and self-report and diagnostic assessments of
bipolar symptoms and episodes. Yearly, at Times 1, 3, and 5, Ps also will complete self-report measures of
circadian chronotype (morningness-eveningness) and social rhythm regularity, a salivary dim light melatonin
onset (DLMO) procedure to assess circadian phase, self-report, behavioral, and neural (fMRI) assessments of
monetary and social RR, and a 7-day EMA period. During each EMA period, Ps will complete continuous
measures of sleep/wake and activity (actigraphy) and 3 within-day (morning, afternoon, evening) measures of
life events coded for reward-relevance and SRD, monetary and social reward responsivity, positive and
negative affect, and hypo/manic and depressive symptoms. The fMRI scan and DLMO procedure will occur on
the day before the start of each EMA period, excluding weekends. This proposal is an innovative integration of
research on reward and circadian signaling in understanding first onset of BSD in adolescence. It has the
potential to facilitate reward and social/circadian rhythm interventions to treat, and ideally prevent, BSD."
11118329,"SUMMARY
Maturation of the HIV-1 capsid requires activation of the viral protease (PR) and proteolytic processing of the
Gag and GagPol polyproteins. Previous studies support a model in which HIV-1 maturation depends on the
proper order and timing of proteolytic events in Gag by PR. According to this model, ordered Gag processing is
determined by the rate of proteolysis at the individual cleavage sites. The structural and dynamic features of
Gag, GagPol, and the immature virion that determine the kinetics and order of processing by PR, including the
autoprocessing of GagPol, have not been characterized. Furthermore, the evolutionary constraints that ensure
the maintenance of ordered and efficient Gag processing are unknown. Previous studies of Gag processing and
GagPol autoprocessing have been limited by a lack of experimental approaches capable of probing dynamic
events and the organization of GagPol within virions. Furthermore, molecular simulations have generally been
performed on reduced structures that do not capture the full complexity of Gag and GagPol complexes. Here,
we will use molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of full-length Gag and GagPol complexes to probe the dynamics
that occur prior to and during interaction with PR and provide atomic resolution detail of these interactions. These
simulations will suggest hypotheses regarding large-scale motions of Gag and GagPol domains that will be
tested through the application of single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging and cryo-
electron tomography (cryoET). These approaches enable visualization of the structure and dynamics of Gag and
GagPol that enable ordered processing by PR in the context of polyprotein monomers, dimers, hexamers, and
intact immature virions. Finally, through consideration of diverse HIV-1 strains and Gag variants that circumvent
inhibition of maturation by modulating the flexibility of the immature lattice, we will determine the evolutionary
constraints on Gag and GagPol that ensure sufficient dynamics are maintained. These data will inform
development of the next generation of maturation inhibitors."
10870224,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Sensory perception originates from the integration of external stimuli with internal representations of the
world, including prior expectations and behavioral states. In normal conditions, balancing new sensory
evidence with internal models leads to flexible and accurate perception. Disrupted balance can lead to
altered perception. The serotonin-2A receptor is associated with such perceptual alterations, both in its role
in schizophrenia and in the action of psychedelic drugs. Experimental evidence presents an apparently
contradictory picture of the effect of serotonergic modulation on neural circuits, increasing neuronal
excitability while simultaneously reducing neural responses evoked by visual stimuli in behaving mice.
Here, we will leverage a synergistic collaboration between theory and experiment to establish a new
theoretical framework for dissecting the neural mechanisms of serotonergic modulation and thereby
reconcile these puzzling observations. Our mechanistic theory is based on a biologically plausible model of
cortical processing, informed by the observed neuromodulation effects. We will combine modeling and
experiment to explain the circuit mechanism mediating the effect of serotonergic modulation on visual
processing. Motivated by recent human fMRI studies showing altered functional connectivity in the
psychedelic state and schizophrenia, we will elucidate how serotonergic activation regulates the
whole-brain functional connectivity from wide field calcium imaging recordings. Our model predictions will
be tested using optogenetic manipulations in a series of new electrophysiology and imaging experiments in
behaving mice."

including pragmatic trials, implementation science studies, and community-engaged projects, among
others. Given our extensive experience, deep expertise, and strong relationships with rural primary care
clinics, WREN is well poised to serve as a Rural Network Research Hub. WREN is supported by the
University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-Madison) School of Medicine and Public Health CTSA (Institute
for Clinical and Translational Research, ICTR) and is in the UW-Madison Department of Family

11118300,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The goal of HIV cure research is to induce “antiretroviral therapy (ART)-free” remission by eliminating persistent
HIV to overcome the need for lifelong ART and improve clinical outcomes associated with persistent HIV
(increased inflammation- and aging-associated diseases). However, HIV cure trials have thus far failed to
demonstrate a clinically meaningful reduction in the HIV reservoir size or lead to sustained ART-free viral control.
The goal of the proposed work is to address a critical need – to determine host in vivo mechanisms that drive
HIV reservoir decay and sustain long-term viral control, identifying potential novel therapeutic candidates for HIV
cure. We recently demonstrated that class II cytokines (specifically, IL-10 and type I and III interferons) exhibited
ongoing fluctuations and predicted faster HIV reservoir decay during the first 24 weeks of ART. These data
support prior work demonstrating a dynamic and temporal role of type I interferons in controlling HIV/SIV infection
and two recent studies that showed a critical role for IL-10 in the maintenance of the HIV/SIV reservoir. However,
these other studies did not specifically evaluate the role of host cellular drivers of class II cytokine-mediated viral
control across HIV stages: acute HIV infection (AHI), ART initiation (ARTi), ART suppression (ART+), and ART
interruption (ATI). Our central hypothesis is that class II cytokines dynamically control virus at different stages of
HIV. We aim to identify the host cellular drivers of class II cytokine-mediated viral control across HIV stages from
50 participants from our UCSF Treat Acute HIV cohort (diagnosed and initiated ART <100 days from infection),
which includes monthly biospecimen sampling as well as optional tissue sampling (gut, lymph node) and ATI
sub-studies. Host viral control will be measured as (1) HIV reservoir decay and (2) post-ATI control (time-to-viral-
rebound [TTVR]). Since there is no “gold standard” for measuring the HIV reservoir, we will leverage several HIV
reservoir assays currently being performed in our cohort, using additional funded grants. We hypothesize that
across longitudinal blood timepoints (Aim 1), class II cytokine-mediated cellular responses exert robust innate
antiviral effects (e.g., after HIV transmission), enhance adaptive/cell survival responses during long-term ART+,
and re-induce innate responses at ATI. We hypothesize that these cellular responses are more robust in tissues
than in blood (Aim 2) since several class II cytokines (IL-10, IFN λ/IL 29) act as antiviral defenses specifically at
mucosal barrier tissue sites. Finally, we hypothesize that plasma metabolic signatures will predict class II
cytokine-driven viral control, priming their use in future HIV cure clinical monitoring (Aim 3). Targeting class II
cytokines represents a promising interventional strategy, but given their complex host-viral temporal dynamics,
a deeper understanding of the natural timing, cellular drivers, and tissue-specificity of these cytokines is needed
to better inform future HIV cure trial design. By identifying the cellular drivers of class II cytokine-driven viral
control across stages of HIV, we expect that findings form this study can be applied/compared to other acute
HIV populations, as well as other class II cytokine-mediated diseases (e.g., cancer, autoimmune disorders)."

Satellite cells are muscle-resident stem cells responsible for postnatal muscle growth, maintenance and
regeneration. In response to muscle injury, quiescent satellite cells are activated, enter the cell cycle and
proliferate, then differentiate to repair the injury or self-renew to replenish the satellite cell pool. In order for
satellite cells to regenerate injured muscles, the cells have to interact and coordinate with a number of other
resident and infiltrating cells during the regeneration. The cell-cell communication is crucial for efficient
muscle regeneration but how different types cells interact in the regenerating muscle is poorly understood.
We have recently employed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the various cell populations
and they interactions during muscle regeneration. This scRNA-seq analysis identifies a new subset of
satellite cells with an immune gene signature that allows them to uniquely interact with the immune cells. We
call these cells immunomyoblasts (IMBs). The existence of IMBs in regenerating muscle is also confirmed
by another independent scRNA-seq study and the immune gene signature is confirmed in our preliminary
studies. The discovery of IMBs not only adds a new dimension of heterogeneity to satellite cells but also
opens a new avenue to understand how satellite cells communicate with immune cells to accomplish timely
resolution of inflammation and completion of regeneration. Based on this exciting discovery, the overall goal
of this proposed study is therefore to explore the origin, dynamics and physiological function of IMBs; and
elucidate the regulatory pathways that underlie the function of IMBs. Upon completion of the project, we will
fill an important knowledge gap on the biology of the newly discovered IMBs. Such knowledge will provide an
immediate clear picture underlying the bilateral crosstalk between satellite cells and immune cells. In the
long-run, the knowledge from this work will have important implications in developing novel strategies to
modulate the IMB– immune cell crosstalk to improve the regenerative capacity of damaged or degenerated
muscles in response to acute injury or under degenerative disease conditions."
11118330,"The overall goal of this proposal is to evaluate the safety and therapeutic potential of a novel strategy towards a cure of HIV
infection. The proposed treatment combines soluble IL-15/IL-15Rα with a TGF-β pathway blockade and therapeutic
vaccination to enhance/restore function of anti-viral immunity that will lead to sustained viral remission following anti-
retroviral therapy (ART) interruption against HIV, using the SIV/Rhesus macaque (RM) model. Persistence of viral
reservoirs and dysfunctional anti-HIV immunity represent two major obstacles that must be addressed to achieve sustained
viral remission via blocking viral reactivation in the absence of ART. ART is highly effective in controlling virus replication
but does not significantly improve T cell function and fails to eliminate viral reservoirs. Anti-viral CD8 T cells are critical
for the control of HIV/SIV replication, yet these cells are largely excluded from secondary lymphoid organs which host a
significant population of viral reservoirs during ART, primarily in T follicular helper cells (Tfh) that reside in B cell follicles
and germinal centers (GC). Thus, novel therapies that that not only restore/enhance function of both anti-viral CD8 T cells
and NK cells, but also promote follicular homing of these cells while viral reservoirs are being reactivated will significantly
enhance clearance of infected cells within lymphoid tissues, thereby contributing to sustained viral remission following
analytical ART interruption (ATI). Our preliminary data demonstrate that treatment with the TGF-β pathway inhibitor
galunisertib (GAL) improves anti-retroviral bioavailability in human lymphoid endothelial cells and cytokine (IL-
15/IL15Ra) treatment in vivo markedly enhances the magnitude, proliferation and cytotoxic potential of SIV-specific CD8+
T and NK cells with follicular homing potential, which is critical for the reduction of reemerging viremia post ART
interruption. In addition, in vitro stimulation of chronically infected PBMC with IL-15/IL15R therapy plus GAL treatment
resulted in higher proliferation anti-viral CD8 T cells and NK cells. Importantly, in vivo administration IL-15/IL15Ra plus
GAL treatment in ART treated macaques enhanced antiviral CD8 T cell and NK cell function. Given these highly
encouraging results, we propose to comprehensively test the effects of IL-15/IL-15Ra therapy plus GAL treatment either
alone or in combination on different T and NK cell subsets during chronic SIV infection under the umbrella of ART (Aim
1), and investigate how these changes affect viral reservoirs under ART and viral control after ART interruption (Aim 2).
Last, we will combine the optimal cytokine therapy with vaccination to further enhance the magnitude and breadth of SIV-
specific CD8 T cell responses that we hope will further improve the therapeutic benefit (Aim 3). These studies will advance
our knowledge about how IL-15/IL-15a therapy plus GAL differentially influence the reservoirs and function of different
subsets of T and NK cells during chronic SIV infection and ART, and what immune mechanisms are induced by dual
therapy and vaccination, and how these contribute to control of chronic SIV/HIV infection in vivo."
11118353,"Project summary:
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been successful at treating HIV infection and allowing people with HIV (PWH)
to lead relatively normal lives. Nevertheless, a cure for HIV has remained elusive, and interruption of ART
results in rapid viral rebound. HIV persists during therapy by its ability to enter a state of latent infection in CD4
T cells. A key challenge in the field is defining the molecular mechanisms that regulate HIV expression and
contribute to maintaining the latent state. HIV expression in latently infected cells is repressed by the
formation of heterochromatin at the integrated provirus that restricts access by key activating transcription
factors (TFs) and RNAPol2. Latency reversing agents (LRAs) have been developed that target HIV regulating
transcriptional pathways. However, most LRAs reactivate only a fraction of the reservoir, suggesting that
latency reversal is inefficient with single agents. We have carried out a set of single cell analyses to
characterize the transcriptomic and epigenomic states of latently infected cells, leading to the discovery of a
latency associated `signature' in primary CD4 T cells. Since then, we have performed a targeted CRISPR
screen of latency-associated genes as well as a chemical screen to identify a set of validated novel host cell
factors that individually regulate HIV latency. In this proposal we will capitalize on these findings to identify
novel combinations of gene knockouts and small molecule inhibitors that can synergize with our validated HIV
regulating factors to achieve broad reactivation of the clinical reservoir. To achieve this, we will take a novel
experimental approach involving both combination CRISPR/LRA screening and using cutting edge
interpretable machine learning tools to define the key drivers of HIV reactivation. Additionally, we will develop
a novel lipid nanoparticle platform for RNA-mediated reprogramming of latently infected cells to promote viral
reactivation."

 The goal of this project is to develop CRISPR epigenome editing tools that achieve cell type specificity
and in some cases temporal specificity to target opioid regulated molecules. Opioid use, dependence, and
addiction have dramatically increased to epidemic proportions in recent years, leading to substantial
financial and societal health burdens, as well as an increasing number of overdoses. The number of
encounters with synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl, has increased 300% since 2014, resulting in an
increase of 72% in synthetic opioid overdoses. To combat this epidemic it is imperative that we
understand the neurobiological underpinnings that lead to opioid use disorder. We must identify
disrupted neuron subtypes in the brain in opioid use disorders and dysregulated molecules within
these neurons that underlie cellular, circuit, and ultimately behavioral adaptations. We must then
develop more effective tools to target endogenous gene transcription of molecules disrupted in opioid
used disorder. To do this we performed RNA-seq in nucleus accumbens medium spiny neuron
subtypes, those expressing D1 or D2, in fentanyl abstinent animals, during a time point in which they
display stress vulnerable behavior. We identified key gene expression networks that are altered in
MSN subtypes of fentanyl abstinent mice.
 In this proposal we will develop CRISPR epigenome editing tools, including temporal specific
Optogenetic CRISPR tools, for selective cell subtype targeting of key fentanyl regulated genes in D1-
MSNs and D2-MSNs. We will test these tools in Neuro2a cells and then in vivo in MSN subtypes
(R21). Validated tools will be used in vivo to alter major hub genes, highly connected genes that
regulate expression of other genes within a network. RNA-seq on MSN subtypes during fentanyl
abstinence will determine if CRISPR tools are effective in targeting hub genes to alter their gene co-
expression networks (R33). In parallel we will test Opto-CRISPR tools to disrupt hub genes during
discreet stress susceptible and opioid intake and relapse time points (R33). Collectively, our studies

endogenous gene loci. Importantly our developed tools can be applied across all brain regions, cell
subtypes, and neuroscience disciplines."
11119329,"ABSTRACT: Childhood obesity is a significant public health problem and key risk factor for chronic conditions
in adulthood. As such, there is critical need to understand childhood obesity etiology and identify opportunities
for the earliest possible interventions to promote wellness across the lifespan. To that end, the objective of this
proposal is to use metabolomics to better understand the foundations of variation in adiposity and body
composition (e.g., fat mass, lean mass, bone mass, weight-for-age) in infancy and early life. The long-term
training goal of this project is to support Dr. Heinsberg in becoming an independent investigator with a program
of research dedicated to understanding and preventing obesity and improving maternal/child health. The
mentored K99 will focus on participants from the nation of Samoa, as Pacific Islanders have the highest risk of
obesity-related complications in the world, are one of the fastest-growing U.S. populations, but are
underrepresented in health research. In Pacific Islander adults, a missense variant (rs373863828) in CREB3
Regulatory Factor (CREBRF) has an effect on body mass index larger than any other common variant.
Paradoxically, the obesity-risk allele is protective against diabetes, making its functional role unclear and
necessitating further mechanistic study before intervention can be considered. The obesity phenotypes of the
variant are not present at birth but present clinically later in childhood. Given the results of CREBRF pre-clinical
modeling and our preliminary work in infants, we hypothesize that the biological effects of the variant are
present much earlier in life. To investigate this hypothesis, the K99 will draw from the Foafoaga o le Ola
(“Beginning of Life”) Samoan infant cohort study. Existing resources include infant CREBRF genotype data,
biospecimens, and body composition measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry as well as rich
behavioral/environmental data for mother-infant dyads at 1 week, 4 months, and 20 months post-birth. We will
use temporal, untargeted metabolomics to increase our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms of the
CREBRF variant with an emphasis on behavior/environment (Aim 1) and the foundations of body composition
over the first two years of life (Aim 2). The results are expected to provide knowledge that can be translated to
improved child wellness and health equity in Samoa and Pacific Islander communities in the U.S. With access
to existing biospecimens and rich data from a geographically isolated birth cohort, unparalleled mentorship,
and superb resources, the training environment is truly outstanding. K99 training goals to support the transition
to independence include (1) metabolomic data collection/analysis, (2) metabolomic data interpretation in obese
phenotypes, (3) conduct of childhood obesity research in underrepresented groups, and (4) career
development. In the R00, the K99 methods will be applied to study early life adiposity in a more diverse sample
(Aim 3). The insights gained will provide critical context for future work to prevent childhood obesity, promote
wellness, and optimize precision medicine for public health."
11119330,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tobacco use rates, including the increasing use of electronic cigarettes, remain at ~20% in the United States,
leading to long-term health and financial consequences for individuals, families, and society. Many individuals
who desire to quit smoking cannot stop, and the underlying neurobiological effects of smoking on the brain
remain poorly understood. Recent large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided
convincing evidence for the association of over 2500 loci with smoking behaviors. Understanding the biological
mechanisms through which these genes impact smoking behavior may provide novel insights into the
underlying biological mechanisms responsible for the use of tobacco products. It is well known that nicotine is
the main psychoactive component in tobacco and is responsible for many of the effects of smoking, from initial
reward to many aspects of withdrawal. Its mechanism of action generally is attributed to its action on nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on neurons. However, astrocytes also express nAChRs and may play a role
in nicotine dependence. Accumulating evidence indicates that astrocytes actively participate in behavioral
responses to nicotine and nicotine abstinence in both animal models and humans. Therefore, some genes
associated with nicotine behaviors in humans may impact these behaviors by altering astrocyte function.
Because little is known about the role of astrocytes in nicotine behaviors, this project aims to use an astrocyte
in vitro functional assay in the R21 phase to functionally assess and prioritize nicotine GWAS genes that may
contribute to nicotine behaviors through their actions in astrocytes. The genes of interest will be validated in
vivo following nicotine exposure as an initial GO NO-GO for that gene. Conditional knock-out (cKO) mouse
models will then be made for the top two genes identified through the screen, and the GO NO-GO decision will
be based on the selectivity and efficiency of removal from astrocytes. The R33 phase will utilize the cKO mice
to confirm functional astrocyte effects of the selected genes and assess the specific nicotine phenotypes
impacted by targeting these genes selectively in astrocytes. Finally, appropriate brain regions from animals
tested will be used for transcriptome studies to identify novel genes and pathways in astrocytes differentially
affected by genotype or nicotine exposure. Our approach is conceptually and technically innovative because
we will be the first to test the idea that astrocyte culture can be used to functionally assess the role of GWAS-
identified genes in nicotine-related neurobiology. We will utilize novel genetic reagents to target GOIs in
astrocytes in the brain specifically. This study is also the first to use transcriptomics to address questions of
GOI function in nicotinic neural responses, specifically in astrocytes. The proposed research is significant
because it will provide insight into astrocyte and GWAS identified gene mechanisms related to nicotine use,
which has important implications for improved understanding of nicotine neurobiology and developing more
effective therapies to help reduce nicotine use and withdrawal symptoms."
11119469,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Food allergy (FA) is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects 8% of children in the United States.
Although racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence and severity of other atopic conditions such as
asthma and eczema have been well described, little is known about differences in FA. Black and Hispanic
children may have worse clinical outcomes than their White counterparts. Less is known about FA among
Asian populations in the US. Phenotypic and endotypic differences, including rates of sensitization and co-
morbidities are currently examined. Data on racial differences in FA management practices, especially as
children enter adolescence are incomplete. Families with food-allergic children may experience impairments
in psychosocial outcomes, however, these data come primarily from White, privately insured families.
The goal of the parent R01 FORWARD award is to:
 1) Determine factors associated with differences in the development of tolerance and new FAs,
 2) Determine differences in FA management and outcomes during adolescence, and
 3) Identify phenotypic and endotypic differences in FA.
Currently, the FORWARD cohort contains 1,357 Asian, Black, White, and Hispanic/Latino children with
physician diagnosed FA. Recruitment will continue at all four study sites until the study reaches a goal of
1,650 children. Study data includes: quarterly online surveys, annual biospecimen samples, and FA-related
electronic health record (EHR) data.
To achieve the parent award goals, EHR data integration from all FORWARD sites is needed. However, EHR
data extraction from individual sites have been inconsistent and variable. Harmonizing data has been
challenging due to the variations in underlying FA clinical documentation, data structures, and data
presentations at different sites. To overcome this barrier, the study team plans to use the Observational Medical
Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM), a person-centric model that enables
transformation of data from diverse observational databases into a common format with standardized
vocabulary to be used to perform systematic analyses.
Therefore, this proposed administrative supplement aims to:
 1. Transform FORWARD participants’ FA clinical data from site-specific EHR systems into the
 OMOP CDM.
 2. Evaluate the conversion of site-specific EHR data to the OMOP CDM.
 3. Generate monthly electronic extraction of OMOP CDM compatible EHR data for FORWARD
participants.
 4. Initiate the implementation of standardized allergist note templates into each site’s EHR system."
11119326,"Implanted leads are critical for direct interfaces to the peripheral nervous system and have been used clinically
since the 1960s. Even so, no open-architecture or open-source leads are available for autonomic nerve
stimulation and recording. This is especially a problem for interfacing with soft, small diameter nerves measuring
1 mm or less. Since these are of great interest as targets in bioelectronic medicine, NEST 4 will introduce a new
open-architecture nerve interface based on a helical cuff format. This cuff addresses the limitations of
downscaling traditional materials and fabrication methods for polydimethylsiloxane-based cuffs and instead
adopts a different scheme to achieve practical nerve cuffs using a composite Parylene C-PDMS structure.
 The CARSS helical microfabricated cuff uses soft polymers and thin film electrodes to achieve a miniaturized
cuff form factor. The contra-rotational helical cuff design is achieved by post-processing the Parylene electrode
array using a thermoforming process to achieve the final three-dimensional shape. The helical design is self-
sizing and self-closing which avoids the need for sutures. The cuff is accompanied by a minimally invasive,
custom endoscopic tool that will simplify surgery and allow access to deeper autonomic nerve branches.
 In NEST 4, the Parylene helical cuff will be developed, benchtop tested, and demonstrated with the surgical
placement tool, paving the way for a widely accessible cuff for smaller nerves in clinical bioelectronic medicine
research."
11118296,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Following HIV infection, a subset of T cells do not die and can revert to a latent state of infection. Much
research over the past decade has consistently found that cells which persist are enriched for the antiapoptotic
protein Bcl2. Consequently, many groups have been studying the selective Bcl2 antagonist Venetoclax and
have now shown that Venetoclax augments death of HIV infected cells during acute HIV infection, IL-7 induced
homeostatic proliferation, during reactivation from latency alone and in the presence of autologous HIV specific
T cells, and in a humanized mouse model of acute HIV infection where Venetoclax monotherapy caused
greater killing of HIV infected cells, normalized CD4:CD8 ratios, and reduced viral load and HIV reservoir size.
Like many proteins, Bcl2 can undergo post translational modification by phosphorylation which alters the ability
of Bcl2 to bind death inducing proteins such as Casp8p41, which is an HIV specific death stimulus. Bcl2
phosphorylation also alters the ability of Venetoclax to bind Bcl2 and promote HIV clearance. In this
application, we present preliminary and novel data showing that during HIV infection, both in vitro and in
lymphoid tissues from HIV infected subjects, Bcl2 is pervasively phosphorylated.
To comprehensively study the effects of Bcl2 phosphorylation of HIV replication kinetics, cell killing and
Venetoclax effects, we have generated for the first time a Bcl2 CRISPR knockout Jurkat cell line and have also
generated Jurkats which stably express different Bcl2 variants with phospho mimic substitutions, or phospho
resistant substitutions at residues known to be susceptible to phosphorylation (at positions 56, 69, 70, 74, 87).
Initial results using those cells indicates that phospho Bcl2 cells are more resistant to HIV induced cell death
and are resistant to the anti-HIV effects of Venetoclax.
Given that Venetoclax has anti-HIV and anti-reservoir effects, it is highly relevant to understand the
determinants of Venetoclax effectiveness and, more broadly, determinants of Bcl2 function. Studies proposed
in this application will define the mechanism and sites of Bcl2 phosphorylation, the impact of those
phosphorylation events of HIV replication kinetics, the number of HIV DNA positive cells, and the anti-HIV
effects of Venetoclax. In addition, we will test clinically relevant strategies to overcome the functional
consequences of phosphorylated Bcl2, enabling more HIV infected cells to die after reactivation from latency."
11118314,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Developing a vaccine against HIV is thus a research priority, but it has been difficult in part because vaccines
have not been able to generate sufficient antiviral immunity able to prevent infection. Our prior research using
Ad5-vectored vaccines show that vaccine prime fractionation improves vaccine-elicited immune responses,
especially neutralizing antibody responses. We have shown that a prime with a low dose (LD) of vaccine,
followed by a booster with a standard dose (SD) of vaccine, results in more potent induction of immune
responses, relative to priming and boosting with the same SD. These results with Ad5 beg the question of
whether vaccine fractionation can also improve other vaccine platforms, and whether such initial “micro-dosing”
approach can be utilized to develop more effective HIV vaccines. To answer this question, our proposal will
have 2 Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1. To evaluate whether vaccine fractionation improves the immunogenicity of Ad26- and
mRNA-based HIV vaccines in mice. Our prior data using an Ad5-SIV vector vaccine show that priming mice
with a LD of vaccine, followed by boosting with a SD of vaccine results in superior immune responses relative to
priming and boosting with the same SD. These data provide a rationale for testing whether the same
immunological effects occur with other HIV/SIV vaccines in mice, including Ad26 and mRNA.
Specific Aim 2. To evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of fractionated HIV vaccines in
macaques. In this aim we will extend our findings to macaques and determine whether vaccine fractionation
improves the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of HIV vaccines.
Our overarching hypothesis is that HIV vaccines can be improved by reducing the priming dose. This
hypothesis is based on our recent published data, as well as a recent vaccine trial (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) in which
the prime dose was accidentally reduced to half and shown to confer higher protection upon boosting, relative
to standard prime dose upon boosting. Taken together, our studies will provide a framework for developing more
effective vaccines against HIV and other infectious diseases and may warrant a re-evaluation of current vaccine
dosing schemes."

Increased attention must be given to the health of women living with HIV (WLHIV) across all
stages of their lives, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and countries like Kenya where girls and
women have the highest HIV prevalence and rates of new infections. Emphasis on women’s
health is critical because WLHIV face unique health challenges and are often disproportionately
affected by co-morbidities, especially as they age. It is essential that institutions build the in-
country capacity to design and conduct research that will improve health of WLHIV. This is the
primary goal of the parent D43 Fogarty-funded program, led by Drs. Elizabeth Bukusi (Kenya
Medical Research Institute [KEMRI]) and Carey Farquhar (University of Washington [UW]), is
entitled Women and HIV: Translation of Research into Practice (WHIV). In this application, we
propose to complement what we are doing in the parent award and provide funding, mentorship
and support for recent graduates of the D43 program who are on the path to becoming
independent investigators. From 2015 to the present, our WHIV Fogarty training program has
supported 27 researchers as they earned advanced degrees at the UW and University of Nairobi
(23 MPH, 4 PhD). We have found that post-graduate funding is essential to ensure the success
of our recent graduates as they transition to initiating independent research on HIV and women’s
health. For this supplement we solicited concept notes from all eligible trainees and identified 4
MPH graduates to compete with full proposals for two fellowship positions. Our Training Advisory
Committee will select the two awardees who will receive stipend and research support for their
studies. They will also receive high-quality mentorship from experienced teams of KEMRI and
UW mentors and participate in online research seminars, manuscript and grant writing workshops,
and regular meetings with the MPIs, their peers and their mentors to review their research
progress and discuss important career development topics. The WHIV D43 has used this
approach with post-doctoral fellows to fill funding and mentorship gaps after graduation and will
build on that successful experience."
11118367,"ABSTRACT
A formidable barrier to a cure for HIV-1 infection is the existence of latently infected cells that sporadically
activate HIV transcription during antiretroviral therapy (ART) and reignite widespread virus replication upon
cessation of ART. Viral RNA expressing (vRNA+) cells are detected at low frequencies in secondary lymphoid
tissues (SLT) of people with HIV (PWH) on ART, constitute the major HIV RNA reservoir in the human body,
and are likely the principal source of rebound viremia when ART is stopped. Little is known about the
microenvironment of vRNA+ cells in SLT of PWH during ART. In lymph nodes and spleen from PWH on
prolonged ART the majority of vRNA+ cells reside outside of B cell follicles and only a minority are TFH. We
observed that vRNA+ cells are preferentially located adjacent to B cells not only in follicular, but also in
extrafollicular regions (EF) of SLT in PWH and SIV-infected rhesus macaques on ART; frequencies of B cells in
EF of SLT correlate with frequencies of vRNA+ cells. In an ex vivo tonsil model of HIV infection, germinal
center B cells (GCB) upregulate HIV expression in TFH. Gene expression analysis revealed GCB induce
expression of multiple cytokines including IL-10, pro-survival molecules, and markers of immune activation.
Further studies revealed that upregulation of HIV expression is not confined to GCB, but that multiple subsets
of tonsil B cells upregulate HIV replication in both TFH and non-TFH CD4+ T cells. IL-10 was shown to
augment survival of HIV-expressing cells in the tonsil model, and we observed that the majority of vRNA+ cells
in spleen from two PWH expressed IL-10. We hypothesize that B cells are major drivers of vRNA
expression in CD4+ T cells in secondary lymphoid tissues of PWH on ART through induction of pro-
survival factors, including IL-10, as well as immune activation. In Aim 1, we will determine the location,
phenotype, and microenvironment of vRNA+ cells in spleen, lymph nodes, and ileum of PWH on prolonged
ART using state-of-the-art immunostaining techniques to assess the hypothesis that vRNA+ cells preferentially
exist adjacent to B cells and express pro-survival and activation markers. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the impact
of SLT B cells on HIV expression in non-TFH CD4+ T cells, and evaluate the role of IL-10 and immune
activation using HIV GFP reporter viruses in SLT from people without HIV infection, as well as spleen and
lymph node tissues from people with HIV infection on prolonged ART. In Aim 3 we will determine whether
depletion of B cells leads to reductions in numbers of vRNA+ cells in SLT during ART using SIV-infected
rhesus macaques. Collectively, these studies will provide a wealth of new information on the cells that express
HIV in SLT and factors within their microenvironment that promote or impair HIV expression during ART. This
knowledge could be used to develop strategies to reverse or alternatively enhance viral latency in vivo to
achieve a functional remission of HIV."

 In this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence application, the candidate proposes a structured, rigorous and
detailed training plan to build expertise in ex vivo gestational tissue modeling and preterm birth physiology along
with continued education in the latest approaches for drug discovery. This training plan will be supported through
hands-on-training, coursework, workshops, training in the responsible conduct of research, seminars and
conferences. The candidate also proposes to gain experience in operating an independent research lab through
grant writing workshops, networking and mentorship from a multidisciplinary advisory committee with expertise
in obstetrics, reproductive sciences, neonatology, infectious disease and chemical biology/pharmacology, whom
have long track records in training future independent researchers. The work in K99 phase will be completed at
Vanderbilt University Medical Center, which has a plethora of resources and expertise available that perfectly
aligned with the PI’s needs. The candidate`s primary goal is to establish a successful, independent research
program that tests translational interventions aimed at management of infection-induced preterm labor (III-PTL).
 Preterm birth, defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation, is the leading worldwide cause of infant
morbidity and mortality. Intrauterine infection and/or inflammation is a major trigger of early labor leading to
preterm birth and fetal inflammation causing adverse neonatal outcomes. Unfortunately, there is a critical lack
of therapeutics for the management of early labor that occurs as the result of infection/inflammation during
pregnancy. Studies involved in the K99 and R00 phases of this proposal encompass novel approaches to identify
effective therapeutic agents to manage III-PTL without adverse effects. Recent transcriptomic studies on
gestational membranes have identified gene targets implicated in III-PTL and we have determined which of these
genes are part of the druggable genome and could be explored for therapeutic regulation of III-PTL. In Aim 1
(K99) we will optimize a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay to measure changes in proinflammatory
cytokines released from pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP)-induced gestational membrane (GM)
explants in 96-well format. We will utilize this HTS assay to screen a customized library of small-molecules that
target the druggable transcriptome associated with III-PTL. We will perform a series of secondary screens to
prioritize hit-molecules into leads. In Aim 2 (R00 phase), we will utilize a high-throughput combination screen to
identify combination therapeutics with synergistic effects. In Aim 3 (R00 phase), mouse models of III-PTL will be
used to confirm the in vivo ability of our lead-single or synergistic combinations to manage PTL and protect
against fetal inflammation. The training plan and outstanding mentoring committee will ensure the success of
the project and support the candidate’s career development towards the establishment of an independent
research lab in the R00 phase."

In this renewal, we seek to understand the origin of heterogeneity in sickle cell disease (SCD), which is present
at every scale from molecules to the clinic, and is the major impediment to clinical management and the
development of new therapies. Moreover, therapy often increases heterogeneity, with some patients responding
strongly to therapy and others unresponsive. Our central hypothesis is that heterogeneity originates with
intracellular kinetics of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) self-assembly that translates into heterogeneous populations of
RBCs, which drive strong non-Newtonian fluid behavior in whole blood and alterations in the systemic circulation
that precipitate pathologies such as endothelial injury, vaso-occlusion, aneurysm, and stroke. Thus, the ability to
guide therapeutic intervention and to develop new therapies is ultimately hindered by our limited understanding
of heterogeneity in the context of multiscale biophysical processes in SCD pathophysiology. In this work, we will
develop a biophysical framework for SCD pathophysiology that spans from molecules to the systemic circulation,
that is experimentally validated at every scale, and that allows us to predict the effects of multiscale
heterogeneity. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop a quantitative framework for HbS polymerization that
accurately predicts the kinetics of self-assembly; (2) Define the connection between the distribution of
HbS polymer and mechanical properties among a population of RBCs; (3) Understand how cellular
heterogeneity drives non-Newtonian blood rheology and altered flow in the systemic circulation. The
work in this renewal builds on key conceptual advances made during our last 3 years of funding: HbS self-
assembly kinetics have previously been underestimated by at least an order of magnitude; HbS polymer is
heterogeneously distributed in RBCs at finite oxygen tension; velocity profiles in sickle blood demonstrate strong
non-Newtonian effects; blood flow in SCD patients is altered throughout the circulation with aberrantly large wall
shear stress relative to healthy blood. This work also leverages a unique and enabling set of tools that we have
developed during the last 3 years of funding: the highest spatiotemporal resolution measurements of single HbS
fiber assembly to-date; the first platform capable of quantifying HbS polymer in large populations of single RBCs
under well-defined oxygen tension; a platform capable of quantifying viscoelastic properties of large populations
of RBCs under well-defined oxygen tension; the ability to quantify submicron velocity fields in flowing blood at
physiologic hematocrit; a platform to quantify sickle blood flow within physiologic oxygen gradients. Building on
these tools and insights, this renewal work will develop and validate a multiscale model describing how
heterogeneity propagates from the molecular to cellular to system levels, and we will develop experimental tools
that can be used for clinical management and therapeutic development."

Executive Summary of Predicate SBIR or STTR Phase I Grant and Team
cosMYC, Inc. intends to develop and commercialize small molecule cancer therapeutics that selectively target
the MYC oncoprotein, which is a transcriptional factor that regulates key transcriptional programs required for
cellular growth and proliferation. Due to its overexpression in more than 70% of human cancers and the functional
validation that MYC downregulation arrests cancer growth, MYC has been the most sought-after therapeutic
target in cancer. Despite decades of effort, therapeutic targeting of MYC has been unattainable due to a
combination of factors, including a lack of enzymatic activity or obvious ligand binding sites that can aid in
inhibitor identification. Recent research by the PI, Dr. Feris (cosMYC CEO), in the Cole laboratory at Dartmouth,
has uncovered an Achilles’ heel in MYC that has enabled therapeutic targeting of this previously undruggable
target. While unraveling the molecular mechanism underlying MYC’s interaction with the
TRansactivation/tRansformation-domain Associated Protein (TRRAP), which is essential for many of the MYC-
driven aberrant transcriptional programs that promote cancer, Dr. Feris’ research revealed a vulnerability in MYC.
This insight led to the development of a revolutionary screening platform which was later deployed to assay more
than 0.5 million compounds. Partial assessment of the high-throughput screening (HTS) efforts identified several
hits that not only blocked intracellular MYC:TRRAP protein-protein interaction (PPI) at low µM potency but also
potently (2 µM) attenuated 2D and 3D growth of multiple cancer cell lines in a highly MYC-dependent manner,
highlighting the specificity and selectivity of the hits. The specific aims of the one-year Phase I STTR project are
to: (1) conclude hit discovery efforts by completing HTS hit assessment and (2) test the hypothesis, using our
recently identified heterocyclic amide compound (A1), that MYC:TRRAP PPI inhibition attenuates tumor growth
in a human lymphoma xenograft mouse model. The goal of the future Phase II project is hit-to-lead development
of Phase I hits for future clinical development as novel MYC-targeted therapeutics for cancer.

11121294,"Evaluation of SeMaglutide as an Adjunct to buprenorphine treatment for the treatment of opioid use
disorder: A pragmatic Randomized placebo-controlled Trial (SMART)
ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
The opioid overdose epidemic is a public health crisis that shows little signs of abating. In the 12-month
period ending in February 2022, over 100,000 people in the U.S. died of an overdose and more than
75,000 involved opioids. Buprenorphine as a treatment for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) is highly eﬀective
in decreasing overdose deaths. but retention is challenging. However, BUP as a mono-therapy may be
insuﬃcient for eliminating illicit opioid use, craving, and stimulant co-use and BUP treatment retention is
problematic. Stimulant use by individuals with OUD has been increasing. Importantly, BUP retention may
be particularly challenging for individuals who use stimulants, and stimulant users may be more likely to
continue illicit opioid use. Thus, stimulant use may be an important therapeutic target for individuals
enrolled in BUP. BUP treatment retention is strongly associated with decreased mortality, with the risk of
overdose increasing dramatically after discontinuing BUP. Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)
analog, may have a beneﬁcial treatment eﬀect on illicit opioid use, craving, and stimulant co-use.
Semaglutide, which was approved for treating type 2 diabetes in 2017 (Ozempic®) and for weight
management in 2021 (Wegovy®), has superior receptor binding aﬃnity and a longer duration of action
relative to older GLP-1 analogs. Semaglutide also holds promise as a treatment for stimulant use
disorders.
The present study is a multi-site, randomized placebo controlled pragmatic trial with the primary
objective of evaluating the impact of semaglutide, relative to placebo, as an adjunct to BUP on substance
use outcomes with illicit opioid use as the primary outcome. Evaluating the eﬀect of semaglutide,
relative to placebo, as an adjunct to BUP on BUP retention is a secondary objective. While it is expected
that semaglutide will be more eﬀective as an adjunct than as a mono-therapy for OUD, the BUP dropout
that will naturally occur during the trial provides the opportunity to explore the feasibility of, and collect
some eﬃcacy data on, the provision of semaglutide, relative to placebo, in individuals discontinuing BUP.
The exploratory aim is to compare substance use outcomes and opioid-related overdoses for the
semaglutide and placebo groups in individuals discontinuing BUP."

The spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza clade 2.3.4.4b among dairy cattle in the United States
has raised concerns over the increased risk of major human outbreaks or even a pandemic. Thus, it is of critical
importance to monitor the ongoing transmission and evolution of the virus within cattle, humans, and other
infected animals residing in or near farms. Here, we propose to establish a real-time outbreak intelligence
framework to facilitate genomic surveillance of the virus at the host- and population-level using data from
individually infected hosts and aggregate samples from sources such as pooled milk. Our framework will
consist of three core components with automated workflows to process raw data from public sources such
as NCBI Sequence Read Archive, perform real-time phylogenetics, examine sequences for mutations of
potential antigenic or functional significance, and develop an early warning system with a real-time analytics
dashboard. We will also conduct real-time phylodynamic studies using Bayesian methods to understand the
emergence and spread of the virus among dairy cattle in the United States. Further, we will ensure that any
data newly collected through this work, and processed results from our framework are publicly available
through Github and whenever applicable through repositories such as NCBI GenBank and discoverable
through the NIAID Data Discovery Portal. Our proposed framework will provide critical insights into the
ongoing evolution of the virus and serve as an early warning system for the emergence of any phenotypes
with pandemic potential."
11122051,"The proposal challenges Hering’s theories of unitary conjugate and vergence commands that guide research
on the neural architecture of oculomotor systems and buttress strabismus intervention. In most oculomotor
research one eye is recorded, assuming that both eyes are “yoked”, rotating together. Yet most eye
movements acquire objects divorced from frontoparallel or midline trajectories, and their control is poorly
understood. While some evidence suggests the eyes are controlled independently, the assumptions of yoked
control nevertheless dominate oculomotor research. Consequently, neural oculomotor structures are
characterized as issuing cyclopean eye rotation commands. Recent monocular pursuit data from our lab argue
against yoked control of vergence movements, which continues to form the basis of almost all oculomotor
control models. We propose a new alternative model architecture with two synergistic components. One is
cognitive and cortical and it moves each eye slowly and separately. The other is reflexive and in the brainstem,
and it moves the eyes rapidly and conjugately as a pair. Our project has the potential to initiate revision of
strabismus assessment by questioning the validity of the critical AC/A ratio diagnostic, and potentially guide
clinicians’ decisions regarding intervention. Aims assess:
Aim 1. Does monocular viewing reveal hidden architecture of binocular eye movement coordination?
Our preliminary data show that during midline pursuit an occluded eye rotates inappropriately for the target’s
motion, often with conjugacy. This might be because the target is misperceived as displaced off the midline, or
eye rotation drifts in a random direction due to misperception of target depth. Alternatively, retinal motion in the
viewing eye triggers brainstem conjugate circuitry that adds conjugacy to the covered eye’s behavior as our
model postulates. We test if conjugacy arises because of misperceptions or of conjugate circuitry activation.
Aim 2. Do asymmetric eye movements reveal contributions of conjugate and independent systems? In
our model, the output of the rapid conjugate system is combined with that of a system that rotates each eye
slowly and independently. We will test predictions of the model concerning how inappropriate ocular intrusions
with Müller alignment and curiously slow midline saccades occur, as well as how asymmetric eye movements
acquire targets in 3D space.
Aim 3. Is the independent system influenced by cognition while the conjugate system is not?
In our data, monocular viewing of an object moving in depth often succeeds in driving vergence pursuit in the
covered eye but fails completely to drive vergence saccades. Furthermore, in the dark, smooth vergence
follows self-generated limb motion, but inappropriate, apparently reflexive conjugate saccades occur when
looking between thumbs “aligned” at different depths. We will test if only the slow system or rapid one is
influenced by cognition, and if they use endogenous signals to track targets."
11122061,"Summary/Abstract
The current supplement is submitted in response to NOFO PA-20-272, and will be utilized to cover
unanticipated costs from the project related to participant retention, which required us to increase our
incentive costs. This grant continues a 13-year longitudinal study where we have followed a cohort of young
people since 2008 beginning at age 11. If we had not increased the incentive payment level in our first survey
year, we would have had considerable attrition of this longitudinal sample. This would have been a great loss
given the longitudinal data already collected as this racially and ethnically diverse and sexual and gender
diverse sample would no longer be generalizable given low retention rates. Differential attrition and decreased
retention would have significantly compromised our ability to address our aims, which specifically focus on
identifying alcohol and other drug (AOD) trajectories over time, determining factors that contribute to these
trajectories (e.g., individual, interpersonal), and examining whether disparities exist over time, and what might
contribute to these disparities. Thus, providing these unanticipated costs was critical to the accomplishment of
study aims. If we do not receive the supplement, we will continue to have decreased ability to meet the aims of
the grant as our statistician and programmer will have limited coverage in the grant years, and their effort is
key to us being able to address our aims and bringing our work to the community, policy makers, and the
public via lay documents, op-eds, and publications. Specifically, we will have a lower likelihood of completing
work related to both Aims 3 and 4 related to the new data collection. Aim 3 focuses on addressing how adult
role functioning and transitions (e.g., work, relationships, parenthood), longitudinally predict subsequent
changes in AOD use and other risk behaviors, as well as health-related quality of life, in young adulthood. Aim
4 focuses on examining disparities across race and ethnicity, gender, and educational attainment. By
increasing the incentive by $10 to $60 per survey wave, we were able to retain this large, diverse cohort and
obtain comparable retention rates across all other waves. This change was critical to addressing our aims,
which focus on longitudinal trajectories of use and outcomes and understanding disparities. The supplement
will preserve the likelihood for the grant to successfully complete all aims and the original Council-approved
scope of research."

11121386,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Almost half of the 1.7 million hospice enrollees have Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) as
the principal diagnosis or a comorbidity. Although hospice care is particularly beneficial to support ADRD
patients and their caregivers at the end of life (EoL), one in five hospice enrollees with ADRD experience
discharge from hospice prior to death, also known as “live discharge.” Hospice live discharge has a profound
impact on EoL care of ADRD patients due to their complex EoL conditions, highly uncertain prognosis, and
difficulty in communicating EoL care preference. Despite two recent policy changes, hospice live discharges
remain persistently high among ADRD patients. The changing hospice market landscape may keep boosting
live discharges among ADRD patients and lead to frequent care transitions and other adverse EoL outcomes
after hospice live discharge. To date, critical gaps exist in understanding outcomes after hospice live discharge
among ADRD patients. Little is known about the longitudinal patterns of care transitions in all care settings,
functional decline, and overall healthcare utilization after hospice live discharge. Although Medicare Advantage
(MA) covers half of Medicare beneficiaries, there is scant evidence about outcomes after hospice live
discharge among MA enrollees. No validated tools are available to predict patient outcomes after hospice live
discharge to facilitate discharge planning and post-discharge care coordination. This mixed-methods project
aims to fill these gaps by characterizing and predicting patient trajectories after hospice live discharge among
ADRD patients. In Aim 1, we will apply longitudinal clustering methods with national Medicare fee-for-service
(FFS) claims and MA encounter data to identify patient subgroups with heterogenous trajectories after hospice
live discharge. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate prediction models for patient trajectories and other
clinically important outcomes after hospice live discharge. We will use Medicare FFS claims, MA encounter
data, electronic health record (EHR) data from two large hospices, and linked claims/encounter data and EHR
data to develop prediction models and ensure fairness of model accuracy by patient race/ethnicity and
socioeconomic status. In Aim 3, we will conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with different stakeholders (e.g.,
physicians, patients and caregivers, and informatics staff) who are involved in the implementation of the
prediction models in care delivery. Evidence from this aim will facilitate the transition from model development
to real-world implementation in the future that can benefit ADRD patients and their caregivers. This project is
well aligned with the National Institute on Aging's priority to better understand the burden of ADRD on patient
outcomes. The proposed research will generate novel evidence to improve patient outcomes after hospice live
discharge and inform the ongoing pilot programs to develop novel hospice care models that are better suited
for the EoL care needs of ADRD patients."

11121133,"Project summary:
 In 2022, sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) had over 11 million Women living with HIV (WLWH), representing more
than half (53%) of the region's total of 20.8 million people living with HIV. WLWH are disproportionately affected
by health challenges that disrupt care across the lifespan, such as intimate partner violence (IPV), and alcohol
use. In addition, a significant proportion of the aging population of WLWH face severe symptoms during
perimenopause. These challenges lead to poor antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, retention in care, viral
suppression, and increased vertical HIV transmission. The intersection of IPV, alcohol use, and menopause in
WLWH is complex, necessitating further research on the design and implementation of strategies to reduce their
impact on HIV care outcomes. There is also an urgent need for research to address critical gaps in our
understanding of the impacts of IPV, alcohol use, and menopausal transition on the health of WLWH. There is,
therefore, a need to train the next generation of researchers to address these challenges and to design,
implement, and scale up tailored and context-specific interventions for the growing population of WLWH in
Uganda and similar resource-limited settings.
 Over the past nine years, we have developed a comprehensive research training program at Makerere
University titled ""Building Implementation Science Capacity at Makerere University to strengthen the response
to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Uganda (MakImS, 2D43TW010037). This research-training program aims to
strengthen leadership and expertise in implementation science and address evolving challenges in HIV care and
prevention in Uganda. The MakImS program has provided a suitable interdisciplinary implementation science-
training environment. Building on the infrastructure established by the MakImS research training program at
Makerere University, we propose a one-year supplement that will spur research interest and careers focused on
HIV and women's health, which has not been a focus of our previous and ongoing work. Specifically, we aim to
1) broaden the scope of the MakImS training program to include HIV and women’s health across the lifespan, 2)
provide research training and mentorship to trainees to address challenges of WLWH in Uganda, and 3) develop
D43 training program application focused on HIV and women’s health across the lifespan in Uganda. This
supplement will leverage the existing resources of the MakImS program, including Makerere University
collaborating HIV programs, and partner universities in the USA."
11122391,"Project Summary
There is a high prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression among women. These
conditions are underdiagnosed and undertreated in Kenya and have been associated with poor adherence to
antiretroviral therapy (ART) and poor retention in care. Evidence from observational and intervention studies
demonstrates that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) ameliorates symptoms of PTSD and
depression and is an effective psychological treatment for adults who have experienced interpersonal or complex
trauma and sexual violence.
We hypothesize that TF-CBT mediated resolution of PTSD, depression, anxiety disorders, and demoralization
syndrome, a condition characterized by loss of meaning in life and feelings of helplessness, will result in improved
ART adherence, engagement in care, and viral suppression among women who are primary caregivers for
children exposed to or living with HIV and contribute to the global goals of Ending AIDS in children by 2030 in
Kenya. Our proposal builds on the primary D43 aims of building research capacity to address HIV in children
and reduce vertical HIV transmission. Additionally, by providing support for a University of Nairobi faculty
member to perform this innovative and impactful research, we will lay a foundation within the institution for further
research to improve women’s mental health and well-being, while advancing the individual faculty member’s
research career.
Our Specific aims are:
AIM 1: Determine prevalence of PTSD, depression and demoralization syndrome among women who are
mothers of children exposed to or living with HIV admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) and Mbagathi
County Hospital and determine their associations with women’s knowledge of HIV status, adherence to treatment
and retention in care. Parents will be interviewed to determine socio-demographic characteristics, and screened
for depression, PTSD and demoralization syndrome using standardized tools.
AIM 2: Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness (measured by improved PTSD, depression and
demoralization syndrome scores, engagement in care, adherence to ART and viral suppression) at 3 and 6
months post provision of TF-CBT to women who are mothers of children receiving inpatient or outpatient HIV
services at KNH. Caregivers will be offered 8-12 sessions of TF-CBT, with follow-up interviews at the end of the
sessions and at 3 and 6 months to determine the impact."

The goal of the parent project, entitled the Vanderbilt-Mozambique Biomedical Informatics (VM-BMI)
Training and Research program, is to capacity-build Mozambican scientists with biomedical informatics
(BMI) research skills to address the HIV epidemic in the country. VM-BMI is a collaboration between
Universidade Eduardo Mondlane (UEM, Mozambique) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center (USA)
and has three aims, namely: (i) to train faculty fellows at UEM in BMI research applied to HIV; (ii) to
develop and implement a BMI track within the existing master’s in informatics program at UEM; and (iii)
to conduct annual HIV-related BMI research workshops and bootcamps at UEM.
The current supplement request responds to NIH’s Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) on Catalyzing
Research and Training on the Impact of HIV on the Health Across the Lifespan of Women Living with HIV
(NOT-TW-24-005). Through this supplement proposal, we will extend the reach and impact of the parent
VM-BMI project by building capacity of Mozambican researchers to better leverage BMI approaches in
addressing key research topics that arise among women living with HIV (WLWH) in Mozambique. In line
with our parent project, this supplement will have two aims, namely: (1) to conduct a week-long training
workshop on BMI-based approaches to address research topics relevant to WLWH. The workshop will
target 20 postgraduate-level participants in health and information sciences from across Mozambique,
introducing them to the interdisciplinary research field at the intersection of BMI, HIV and women’s
health. (2) Implement a 9-month research certificate program in HIV, Women’s Health, and BMI.
Trainees in the certificate program will gain in-depth expertise in conducting BMI-research with relevance
to WLWH through a combination of coursework, seminars, research training, and through implementation
of a pilot research project. Funds from the supplement will be used to support two UEM faculty members
to pursue this certificate program."
11122448,"Kenya has a high burden of generalized HIV with women disproportionately affected. The use of
highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has improved survival of people living with HIV, with
more women living with HIV (WLHIV) transitioning into menopause. Menopause, diagnosed
retrospectively following cessation of menstrual period for twelve consecutive months, is
associated with mild to debilitating symptoms; reduced adherence to HAART and high risk of
cardiovascular diseases, obesity and diabetes. It results in reduced health related quality of life,
productivity, physical activity, and higher cost of healthcare. Kenya has no program to screen and
provide menopause care to WLHIV transitioning into menopause. The proposed study aims to
determine acceptability, barriers and facilitators of the integration of menopausal syndrome
screening among women receiving HIV care, and complement the training and capacity building
activities currently underway as part of the NIH D43 (INTEGRATE (NIH TW009580) at Kenyatta
National Hospital. Specifically, the proposed study will provide an opportunity for research training
and mentorship for Dr. James Amenge, a Gynecologist at Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), and
provide preliminary data for his K43 application. In aim 1, we will use the six-item Menopause
Question (MQ6) and the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) to screen and score the severity of
menopausal symptoms among WLHIV ages >35 years. In am 2, we will use mixed methods to
identify barriers and facilitators to integration of menopause screening; and through a stakeholder
led process develop a primary health menopausal care package that includes screening and
management of non-severe menopausal symptoms in aim 3. This is one of the first studies aimed
at integrating menopause screening and management in HIV care in Kenya. An integrated
screening and management will enable prompt identification, and management of menopausal
syndrome with resultant improved quality of life, enhanced productivity and a dignified healthy
transition."
11122458,"Despite the progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS, women around the world remain disproportionately
affected by HIV. More than half of the HIV cases globally are women, and young women are as twice as
likely as young men to acquire HIV. Biological factors have all been suggested to increase women’s risk to
HIV, and are compounded by social factors such as stigma, social norms, and barriers to accessing sexual
and reproductive health services. Consequently, women living with HIV (WLWH) experience mental health
illnesses like stress, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms at higher rates than their male
counterparts and more often than HIV-unaffected women. These mental health issues affect not only the
well-being and quality of life of WLWH but have implications for HIV management and transmission
prevention. While mental illnesses have significant impact on management of HIV disease, data on the
burden of mental illnesses and their impact in SSA where most of the PLHIV are residing is lacking. The lack
of well-trained HIV researchers in mental health and women’s health has also contributed to the low
understanding of comorbidities affecting WLWH in SSA. Therefore, there is a need to build research capacity
in HIV and mental health particularly among WLWH by investigating the impact of depression on health of
WLWH in SSA countries like Tanzania, where HIV prevalence is still high at 4.4% in the general population
but higher in women at 5.6%. The ongoing Tanzania AIDS Malignancies Research and Training Program
D43 (TW012277) provides a unique opportunity to train young investigators in the field of HIV-associated
malignancy research to address some of the challenges highlighted. We are proposing to mentor a junior
female faculty oncologist who can lead a study in establishing the burden and impact of depression on health
of WLWH in the country. We hypothesize that WLWH, especially those diagnosed with cancers, will have
high rates of depression, and this condition will negatively influence their ability to control HIV disease. To
test this hypothesis, the team will: a) enroll women (HIV+/HIV-, and cancer+/cancer-) at Ocean Road Cancer
Institute in Tanzania and establish the burden of depression among WLWH by using a validated depression
assessment tool, PHQ-9. Information on ART use and its adherence, CD4 counts, HIV viral load, and HIV
disease stage will also be systematically documented; b) assess the impact of depression on health of WLWH
by analyzing severity of depression and how it affects outcomes of WLWH in terms of ART adherence, HIV
plasma viral load suppression, and HIV disease stage. The proposed study will provide a unique opportunity
for a new investigator (Dr. Queen) to acquire new skills in HIV, mental health, and women’s health research
as a stepping-stone to embark on HIV/AIDS research career and improve research capacity in Tanzania.
The generated mental health and outcomes data will be important preliminary data for future research and
crucial in designing future strategies to improve health outcomes for WLWH in SSA and beyond."

The mission of the ITN is to advance the clinical application of immune tolerance by performing
high quality clinical trials of emerging therapeutics based upon testable mechanistic hypotheses.
The ITN is structured in order to interrogate different diseases across the immunologic
spectrum, with integration of innovative clinical studies and cutting edge immunology laboratory
analysis. The ITN approach—clinical assessment of novel tolerance therapeutics, while we
simultaneously evaluate the cellular, genetic, and immunologic mechanisms of disease and how
they are altered in response to therapy—creates a framework for advancing cross-disease and
cross-discipline knowledge, all designed to accelerate therapeutic options for major diseases.
Since its inception, one of the areas of interest of the ITN has been Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) with
a focus to successfully enhance the development of tolerance therapies. We outline a process
to evolve our current strategies into the next generation of planned trials, as well as how we
plan to operate a nimble, future-focused organization, poised to lead and adopt innovations that
are currently unknown. We utilize a collaborative structure involving hundreds of investigators,
advisors, and clinical sites and mechanistic laboratories working in tandem with a core group of
ITN staff, operating a program that is both scientifically and financially efficient. With lead
institutional commitment from the Benaroya Research Institute and the University of California
San Francisco, and participation of more than 20 other major institutions represented in
leadership and major advisory roles, the ITN strives to continue to successfully pioneer high
impact clinical trials and mechanistic studies in T1D."
11121146,"PROJECT SUMMARY
11.2 million (23.5%) older adults report difficulty traveling outside their homes, making limited transportation
access a structural barrier to health. With over 7 million non-driving older adults and 7-10 non-driving years at
the end of life, alternative transportation options are needed. Lack of public transit accessibility can
disproportionally harm older adults with disabilities and may impact health behaviors, such as physical activity
and social participation. Physical activity and social participation are key components of healthy aging,
associated with cognition, quality of life, and mortality. To this end, identification of modifiable public transit
features, and their impact on physical activity and social participation among older adults with disabilities is
critically needed. The proposed research will examine the role of public transit on physical activity and social
participation among older adults with and without disabilities. This research will collect primary data on public
transit accessibility features and link them to the National Health and Aging Trends Study. Specifically, this
research will address the following aims: 1) Examine if self-reported public transit use is associated with
physical activity and social participation among older adults with and without disabilities, 2) Determine if the
accessibility of public transit systems is associated with physical activity and social participation behaviors
among older adults, 3) Test the hypotheses that public transit use partially mediates the link between public
transit features and (a) physical activity and/or (b) social participation among older adults. The proposed use of
NHATS, a rich, integrated data source will allow for investigation into whether public transit use interacts with
disability status to result in differential physical activity and social participation (Aim 1); if the density and
accessibility of public transit systems interact with disability status to affect physical activity and social
participation (Aim 2); and the mechanism through which disability, public transit features, and public transit use
shape physical activity and social participation among older adults (Aim 3). This research will examine if public
transit system access is associated with physical activity and social participation among older adults with
disabilities, a potential intervention target to optimize older adults’ ability to age in place. Identification of
modifiable, upstream factors could reduce health disparities among this population group. The findings from
this work will inform transportation development and planning about public transit systems which are inclusive
of older adults with disabilities."
11121307,"Elastic, Degradable Vascular Grafts with Helical Microfibers
 When an artery occludes, rerouting blood flow with a vascular graft can save lives or limbs.
Autologous grafts are the preferred conduit for replacing small-diameter vessels. However, not all
patients have suitable donor vessels, and the wound healing complications associated with the
harvest can be severe. Synthetic grafts can be used but the foreign material does not degrade or
integrate with the host, leading to graft failure and risk of infection. These grafts function best in
large caliber arterial reconstruction but perform poorly in smaller arteries such as in the coronary
and below the knee arteries. We will overcome this challenge by using a degradable graft made of
elastomeric microfibers arranged in helices mimicking extracellular matrix fibers in the artery. Our
preliminary data in rats show these grafts remodel into compliant, elastic vascular conduits
resembling the native arteries. The proposed research will address two key questions for clinical
translation: 1) will host cells fully populate the long grafts needed for human applications and 2)
will the same transformation occur in aged patients and those with systemic diseases such as
diabetes? Correspondingly, Specific Aim 1 will investigate host remodeling of 7-inch-long
interposition grafts in a sheep carotid artery. Aim 2 will assess graft remodeling in Zucker Diabetic
Sprague-Dawley rats, a new polygenetic model of Type 2 diabetes. Aim 3 will evaluate the
effectiveness of controlled release of cytokines in the graft to overcome the limitations caused by
aging. Upon completion of this project, we expect to have a graft design ready for clinical
translation. The knowledge gained will have impact beyond vascular substitutes in the
development of other cardiovascular devices."
11121153,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Brain rhythms coordinate the activities of thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas for complex cognitive
functions. The hippocampal theta (4-12 Hz) rhythm, for instance, is not only important for information coding
during learning and memory, but also associated with memory dysfunctions in aging and Alzheimer's disease
(AD). However, the anatomical origin and related circuitry that control theta rhythms remain largely unknown. In
this proposal, I seek to establish the role of the supramammillary nucleus (SuM), an understudied
hypothalamic structure, as a key modulator of hippocampal theta oscillations, elucidate the link between
structural and physiological changes of the SuM circuitry and memory deficiency, and develop minimally
invasive SuM stimulation strategies for transcranial theta entrainment and cognitive reserve
enhancement in AD animals. My preliminary data have shown that optogenetic stimulation of the SuM robustly
induces hippocampal theta oscillations. Furthermore, the entrained theta rhythm significantly enhances animals’
learning efficiency in a hippocampal-dependent spatial memory task. These results suggest the SuM to be a
previously unknown hypothalamic theta modulator and a potential target for therapeutic strategies to prevent or
reverse memory impairment. This proposal is aimed to gain a mechanistic understanding of the SuM and its
circuitry by taking advantage of a recently developed transgenic (SuM-Cre) mouse that provides genetic access
to the SuM and an array of modern neuronal recording and manipulation techniques. In the K99 phase, I will
dissect the SuM-hippocampal circuits, probe their physiological roles in hippocampal theta oscillation, and
elucidate how they globally reshape hippocampal coding for memory processing (Aim 1). I will further identify
how aging modifies the structure, physiology and function of the SuM circuitry, leading to oscillation abnormalities
and memory dysfunctions (Aim 2). To achieve these goals, I will receive complimentary training in experimental
and computational neuroscience, including aging neurobiology and AD in Dr. Thomas Wisniewski’s lab, large-
scale in vivo recordings and hippocampal physiology in Dr. György Buzsáki‘s lab and neural data analysis and
neural systems modeling in Dr. Zhe Sage Chen’s lab. In the R00 phase, I will develop minimally invasive SuM
stimulation strategies for transcranial theta entrainment. I will further apply this technology to test whether SuM
stimulation could enhance cognitive reserve in a mouse model of AD (Aim 3). This project will not only lay the
groundwork for understanding a brain-wide theta circuitry by identifying the SuM as a previously unknown
hypothalamic theta modulator, but also provide a direct entry point into disentangling theta modulation as a
mechanism and modulation target for aging-associated memory dysfunctions."
11121163,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) from electronic health records (EHRs)
can facilitate participant enrollment in clinical trials and early intervention once clinically available. Subjective
cognitive decline (SCD) can be an early manifestation of ADRD. Previous research in early detection of ADRD
has focused on observational study cohorts, generally small in size and often with stringent medical exclusion
criteria. Investigation of larger and more representative samples is needed to develop a full understanding of
the underlying conditions, procedures, and/or interventions that can contribute to cognitive decline or
accelerate progression to dementia in the population at large. The overall goal of this proposed research is to
leverage large-scale EHR data and advanced informatics technology to develop case-finding methods for SCD
and to advance the understanding of its risk factors and dementia outcomes in older adults. Preliminary data
suggest that clinical notes and machine learning (ML) algorithms can be helpful to capture patients with early
cognitive decline. However, identifying which patients with SCD are more likely to develop dementia is
extremely challenging. During the K99 phase, the first aim will be to develop an informatics approach to identify
a pre-dementia cohort (patients with evidence of a cognitive concern but no dementia). The second aim will
identify the social and clinical characteristics of this cohort in the EHR, along with antecedent risk factors, and
predictors for a dementia outcome. The two hypotheses are that 1) clinical conditions (eg, neuropsychiatric
disorders, cardiovascular diseases, renal disease, respiratory infections, sleep disorders) and medications that
deleteriously affect cognition will contribute to the initial appearance of cognitive decline; and 2) longitudinal,
multimodal EHR data can be leveraged in ML models to stratify patients with high risk of dementia. To
accomplish these goals, the applicant will leverage existing strengths in case identification, risk factor
analyses, and prognostic modeling and gain additional knowledge and skills in three critical areas of training:
(1) cognitive decline and ADRD, (2) clinical epidemiology, and (3) statistical methods. With the development of
these skills, the applicant will be well positioned in the R00 phase to conduct the final aim: to study the
antecedent risk factors and outcomes of SCD in a presumed SCD cohort (patients with both a subjective
cognitive concern and normal performance on objective cognitive measures). Similar approaches to those
used in the second aim will be employed to study the presumed SCD cohort. A highly innovative component of
this project is the use of advanced artificial intelligence and large-scale EHR data for presumed SCD cohort
identification, risk factor analyses, and early detection of dementia. The proposed study will provide some of
the first insights into the characteristics and risk factors of SCD in the EHR, and predictors for dementia
outcomes in SCD. For the applicant, this program will support a rapid transition to independence through a
short period of intensive training and mentorship, which will seamlessly intertwine with the aims of the
proposed project."

The global objective of the Personalizing EmerGency/Acute therapeuticS Utilizing Systems biology
(PEGASUS-2) Research Program is to improve drug effectiveness and safety in common acute care conditions.
Drug therapy for acute conditions in the emergency department is only effective in approximately 50% of cases.
There is tremendous opportunity to improve acute therapeutics by implementing precision medicine programs
in acute care settings. We will build on the progress of PEGAUS-1 through 1) expand our multi-omic analyses
in our target drug classes, 2) expand our statistical analytic methods to include multi-omic, machine learning
analyses, and polygenic risk scores, and 3) expand to new sites in order to validate our findings. We will leverage
our robust emergency medicine specimen bank (EMSB), the only acute care biorepository that focuses all
patients presenting with acute illness, and we will continue to use phenotypic data from our electronic health
record linking these data to pharmacogenomic, epigenomic, metabolomic, and proteomic data to discover new
mechanisms of drug effectiveness and safety. Ultimately clinical and `omic data are integrated into multi-omic
models to improve therapeutic success in acutely ill patients. Through the Maximizing Investigators' Research
Award (MIRA) funding, PEGASUS-2 will continue to focus on common acute care conditions such as nausea,
pain, and cardiovascular disease. In the future, these models will be tested prospectively. PEGASUS-1 has
already identified numerous genetic and metabolic polymorphisms associated with drug effectiveness and
expansion of the program will serve to increase our understanding of these mechanisms and improve the
treatment of acute conditions."
11123665,"Stimulant drug (e.g., crystal methamphetamine, cocaine, ecstasy, MDMA) use is a substantial public
health problem among young gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (YGBMSM) in the United
States (US). Stimulant use is associated with increased engagement in sexual risk behaviors and decreased
use of HIV prevention and treatment services, and as such leads to increased HIV acquisition/transmission.
There are currently no evidence-based interventions to reduce stimulant use and concurrent HIV risk among
YGBMSM; in response to this urgent need and building of over a decade of NIH-funded formative and pilot
research, the proposed hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial is designed to assess the
effectiveness and implementation strategies of Project IMPACT—a HIV status neutral, modular behavioral
intervention to reduce HIV risk in YGBMSM who use stimulants in the context of high-risk sex. The
intervention incorporates HIV risk reduction counseling (including supporting PrEP and ART use) with
behavioral activation (BA)—an evidence-based, easy to administer, cognitive behavioral approach to treat
depression that focuses on helping individuals re-engage in activities that generate feelings of enjoyment.
 Our conceptual model posits that BA will re-engage YGBMSM in pleasurable non-drug use activities
that will serve as a natural reinforcement for functional behavior, improve depressed mood when not on
stimulants by experiencing increases in pleasure, and decrease overall distress so that YGBMSM who use
stimulants can better benefit from HIV risk reduction counseling. The initial pilot trials of Project IMPACT
resulted in significant reductions in sexual risk, stimulant use and depressive symptoms.
 Research Plan Overview: By harnessing the resources, geographic and site diversity, and
multidisciplinary expertise of the Adolescent Trials Network (ATN), the current proposal aims to efficiently and
rigorously prepare Project IMPACT for rapid translation into real-world practice. Following the RE-AIM
Framework, we will test the reach and effectiveness of Project IMPACT (compared to an enhanced Standard
of Care condition) in a two-arm, multi-site and multi-format (i.e., in-person and virtual) randomized controlled
trial of 360 cisgender YGBMSM who use stimulants in the context of high-risk sex. Participants will be
followed for 12 months, and primary outcomes include number of condomless anal sex acts while not
protected by PrEP (HIV- YGBMSM) or while not virally suppressed (HIV+ YGBMSM) and stimulant use (via
urinalysis). We will also test our multi-faceted implementation strategy by assessing adoption/ accessibility
and implementation using mixed-methods assessments that describe and examine characteristics of
successful implementation (including differences by intervention delivery format). Finally, we will assess the
feasibility of maintenance and sustainment of Project IMPACT by using the well-established CEPAC-AYA
model to project its cost effectiveness on HIV transmissions, QALYs, and per person lifetime costs."
10872239,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Varying cognitive processes like attention can be a powerful tool for investigating the function and 
flexibility of cortical circuits. Attention has dramatic effects on behavior, and deficits in selective attention 
are a hallmark of neuropsychiatric disorders ranging from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to autism 
to Alzheimer’s disease. Knowing which of the concomitant changes in the brain are responsible for those 
shifts in behavior can reveal what is important about circuit function in the first place.
One of the most notable aspects of how any cognitive process affects cortical circuits is its 
heterogeneity: attention has vastly different effects on different neurons, having different magnitude and 
often sign effects on the rates and shared variability of even nearby, simultaneously recorded neurons. 
This heterogeneity is not unstructured, however. For example, there are neuron-by-neuron correlations 
between the magnitude and sign of modulation by spatial attention and by having multiple visual stimuli in 
the receptive field, between modulation by feature attention and the strength of a neuron's tuning for the 
relevant feature, and between modulation by attention and neuron-behavior relationships.
This structured heterogeneity has the potential to provide unique insight into cortical function because 
it could be caused by either network or cellular mechanisms. Through our long running collaboration, the 
Cohen and Doiron groups proposed a circuit mechanism that accounts for the effects of attention on 
single neurons and on the response variability that is shared within and between neuronal populations.
However, our network model only captures the neuron-averaged correlates of attention.
We will study the role of cell-intrinsic and network properties in the flexibility of circuits in visual cortex. 
We will measure, manipulate, and model the activity of large groups of visual and premotor neurons while 
modulating multiple types of attention that pose distinct challenges for mechanistic models: spatial 
attention (Aim 1) and feature attention (Aims 2 and 3). This ambitious project will combine multi-neuron, 
multi-area recordings, causal manipulations, flexible and rigorously controlled behavioral paradigms, and 
circuit modeling. Our efforts will produce rich data sets and models that provide a platform for studying 
the mechanisms underlying cognition and complex behavior in many systems."
11118194,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An interdisciplinary, team science approach is required to address our most complex scientific questions. Yet
team science can be challenging, as collaboration requires additional coordination and communication to
succeed and few researchers are trained in strategies to support collaborative work. Previous research has
identified practices and activities of effective collaborative science teams, including collaboration planning,
authorship agreements, and clear roles and responsibilities. Central to these activities is effective, efficient
management of information, defined here as the human-generated digital objects of the team's work to achieve
its scientific goals. Translational Teams (TTs), those conducting Clinical and Translational Research (CTR),
are an ideal population in which to investigate questions of team science and information management. TTs
are a hybrid of academic research and product development teams, with a goal of creating and advancing a
discovery from the bench to the clinic to the community. To accomplish this, TTs work across disciplines and
institutions, potentially over long periods of time, engaging with a wide variety of information to generate new
biomedical knowledge. Currently, we know little about the ways in which TTs engage with information across
the translational spectrum. Previous research has shown that TTs use a constellation of information strategies,
processes, and tools simultaneously and, often, haphazardly, to manage the information of CTR. This
haphazard approach to information management leads to lost or misplaced information, inaccurate records,
and delays in efforts to improve health. Poorly documented studies can jeopardize study participants when key
information is not tracked and communicated. This gap in TTs' information management represents an
opportunity to improve how TTs conduct research, increase rigor and reproducibility, and expedite
implementation of CTR. The long-term goal of this research is to improve the capacity of TTs for doing high-
impact team science by improving their ability to manage their projects' information. Our mixed methods
project will complete the following aims. Aim 1: Develop a conceptual framework describing the impact of TT
information behaviors on the conduct of CTR. We will identify and catalog the information involved in CTR and
the strategies, tools and processes TTs use to engage with information, then develop a conceptual framework
that maps the information behaviors that facilitate or impede the conduct of high-impact collaborative CTR. Aim
2: Prototype and test an educational module to train and coach TTs in developing and implementing team- and
individual-level information management strategies adapted to the team's collaboration context. We will create
and test a feasible, usable intervention to help TTs improve their information management practices. The
expected outcome is an intervention to facilitate improved conduct of team-based CTR. Future work will
include validating the intervention across the Clinical and Translational Science Award hubs and beyond, as
well as measuring long-term impact on scientific outcomes."

11121182,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term objective of this project is to determine the general principles and causal mechanisms
underlying subcellular RNA localization, and the physiological implications during development and disease. In
particular, the subcellular localization of messenger RNA (mRNA) to cell protrusions is known to be required
for cell migration, but the mechanisms by which mRNA localization regulates protein function in this setting are
unclear. Many genes implicated in mRNA localization are expressed in neural crest cells, which are
a particularly migratory cell type that gives rise to much of the vertebrate head, as well as neurons,
melanocytes, and aggressive cancers including melanoma. As such, neural crest cells provide a rich
environment to uncover molecular mechanisms of mRNA localization in cell migration as well as the relevance
there of to mammalian physiology. In this project, I will use cultured melanoma cells to identify and
characterize trans-acting regulators of mRNA localization and elucidate the role of mRNA localization on
protein function. I will also use in vivo mouse models to catalog mRNA localization that occurs during neural
crest cell development and directly test the role of a well characterized localized mRNA, Kif1c, during
development and cancer onset and progression. As neural crest and cancer genetics fields rely heavily on
transcriptional studies, the mechanistic understanding of a post-transcriptional process as described here may
provide unique insight into the cause, diagnosis and treatment of craniofacial birth defects and melanoma
onset and progression.
My career goal is to run an academic research program analyzing the role and regulation of subcellular RNA
localization during embryogenesis, with special attention to neural crest cells and their derivatives. My ambition
is to have a lab that can determine molecular mechanisms at the single-molecule level and causally link those
processes to physiological outcomes in vivo. To this end, the proposed experiments and training plan are
designed to develop expertise in cutting-edge technologies such as TIRF microscopy, computational image
analysis, genetic engineering and in vivo disease assays. Training in these advanced techniques will be
directly supported by the resource-rich and collaborative environment at UT Southwestern, and especially
mentorship from Dr. Gaudenz Danuser, Dr. Ondine Cleaver, Dr. Khuloud Jaqaman, Dr. Lu Le and Dr. Sean
Morrison, who make up my advisory committee. The Pathway to Independence Award will provide the time,
resources and autonomy to fully develop and initiate this ambitious research program and accrue the
resources, expertise and experience necessary to launch an impactful, thriving research lab in Fall 2024."
11120790,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is a fundamental gap in the mechanistic understanding of the optokinetic reflex (OKR), used in the clinic
to diagnose a variety of visual and neurological disorders. The OKR provides a unique system in which the visual
system input, and eye movement output, are well-controlled and quantifiable, and the information bottleneck at
dedicated ganglion cell types is accessible. The long-term goals are to reveal the mechanistic basis of the OKR
from the molecular programming of circuit wiring to computations to stimulus (in)dependence and to translate
this knowledge into diagnostics. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine how the individual and
population properties of two specific ganglion cell types influence eye movements. This proposal’s focus is on
the vertical OKR, which is subserved by up/Superior and down/Inferior preferring ON direction selective ganglion
cells (Superior and Inferior oDSGCs). Preliminary work leads to a central hypothesis: The vertical OKR is
influenced by properties that can be traced to retinal direction selective circuits and specifically, motion encoding
in Superior and Inferior oDSGCs individually and as a population. Previous studies show that the OKR is contrast
sensitive and asymmetric, with higher gain in the up vs. down directions. Differences in intrinsic properties, e.g.,
dendritic morphology, and synaptic inputs can explain these phenomena with contrast sensitive spike tuning
curves and greater responses in Superior vs. Inferior oDSGCs. Recent single-cell sequencing supports the
asymmetry with identification of differentially expressed genes in Superior vs. Inferior oDSGCs, including
molecular guidance cues that could be integral to the development of direction selective circuits. We propose to
examine the fundamental molecular and computational mechanisms that support and preserve the vertical OKR
across diverse stimulus statistics. We will achieve this by (1) using mouse genetics to elucidate the molecular
processes that construct and maintain direction selective circuitry, and (2) measuring oDSGC population
responses and OKR in the context of stimulus perturbations including noise. (Aim 1) Identify essential signaling
pathways for the development of direction selective circuits and the OKR, and (Aim 2) Elucidate the mechanisms
of noise correlations among populations of oDSGCs and their impact on the OKR. The aims will be accomplished
by using stimulus manipulations, genetic perturbations, cellular physiology, circuit mapping, and computational
modeling to identify characteristics of the reflex, their potential mechanistic basis, and their stability or adaptability
under different visual environments. The expected outcomes for Aim 1 will be a concise link between molecules,
retinal circuits, and behavior, and for Aim 2 will be insight into how stimulus statistics, including noise correlations,
influence behavior. The proposed work is significant because it will reveal—from molecules to behavior—how
cells, circuits, computations, and their behavioral output operate in health and change in disease in an
evolutionarily conserved system with the potential for clinical application of knowledge gained in this proposal."

The goal of our parent D43 training grant is to provide training in research focused on HIV treatment, HIV cure,
and HIV genomics research at the Botswana Harvard Health Partnership (BHP), building on advances in
clinical trial and laboratory research infrastructure at BHP that support training opportunities in high-impact HIV
research. This supplement would support two MD trainees in Botswana to conduct two mentored research
projects that focus on different understudied aspects of the health of older women with HIV, a large and
growing group of people living with HIV globally. The first aim (led by mentee Dr. Unoda Chakalisa, primary
mentor Dr. Shahin Lockman) would compare key attributes of menopause in older women with vs. without HIV
in Botswana in a new cross-sectional population of women in Botswana. The second aim (led by Dr. Marcella
Yoseph, primary mentor Dr. Roger Shapiro) would compare pregnancy incidence and adverse pregnancy
outcomes by age group and by HIV status by leveraging the very large (292,000 existing records,
approximately 21% of them from women living with HIV) nationwide Botswana Tsepamo birth outcomes
database. This mentored research will help catalyze the training and career development of these two
promising trainees who are interested in conducting research that will improve the health of women living with
HIV."
11122556,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Women and girls constituted 53% of all people living with HIV, and nearly 2/3 of all new HIV infections in Africa
were among women and girls in 2022. Prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) among the general
population of women aged 15 to 49 years in the WHO African region is ~33%, and as high as 63% for those
who are living with HIV. Women and Girls Living with HIV (WGLHIV) experience significant risk for new-onset
IPV or its intensification when they disclose their HIV status to their male partners. Besides HIV, the risk of IPV
is higher for women if they are pregnant, sex workers, or adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) and we
have chosen to focus on these vulnerable, hardly reached WLGHIV in Northern Nigeria (Sokoto, Northwest
Zone and Abuja, North Central Zone) for this study. There is less IPV evidence in Northern Nigeria as
compared to the South; this allows us to better understand and inform IPV service delivery in the Northern
socio-cultural context.
Our SWANN study is a cross-sectional, mixed methods study which will inform changes in IPV tools and services;
we aim to further center survivors and then adopt a survivor-provider co-creation approach to revising IPV tools.
These tools, which inform the “what” and “how” GBV/IPV services are delivered, were developed by multilateral
and bilateral organizations as well as local NGOs, however, to date, there has not been input or evaluation by
GBV/IPV survivors. To increase the evidence base and survivor-centeredness of IPV services for WGLHIV in
Nigeria, our approach will be informed as follows:
Aim 1: To assess the prevalence of all types of IPV among vulnerable women and girls living with HIV in
North-Central and North-West Nigeria.
Aim 2: To explore the range of IPV and IPV service experiences among vulnerable women and girls living with
HIV in North-Central and North-West Nigeria
Aim 3: To increase survivor-centeredness of existing tools for intimate partner violence services in HIV
programs in Nigeria
The proposed study is designed to center and address the needs of women and girls living with HIV who are
highly vulnerable to IPV in Nigeria’s HIV program. The structured review of GBV/IPV tools is expected to
strengthen, and better integrate structured IPV services for WGLHIV in HIV programming. Our established
partnerships with legal, women’s and state agencies, organizations and advocacy groups will help ensure
applicability to local legal and policy context, influencing state and federal policy to better protect women at risk."

It is striking and disheartening that Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders (AA-NHPI)
experience health disparities that are substantial, growing, and poorly understood. Our project entitled “Hawai‘i
Health Equity Research and Outreach Network (HAWAI‘I HERON)” will create an Administrative Core to allow
us to quickly respond and participate in multi-institutional studies that support three health equity pillars: equity
of voices, equitable data efforts, and equity in clinical trials. First, we will enhance equity of voices by 1) amplifying
the voices of our AA-NHPI stakeholder communities; 2) understanding diverse patient perspectives, preferences,
and unmet needs; and 3) supporting expansion of culturally and linguistically tailored health education. Second,
we will support equitable data efforts by expanding capacity to evaluate outcomes by 1) race/ethnicity; 2)
geography; and 3) other social determinants of health. Third, we will promote equity in clinical trials by 1)
identifying barriers; 2) employing innovative strategies to increase clinical trial enrollment for AA-NHPI; 3)
understanding the impact of the evolving multicultural landscape on trial participation; and 4) increasing training
for diverse students and investigators. The HAWAI‘I HERON Administrative Core will foster collaboration with
the Food and Drug Administration Office of Minority Health and Health Equity and other institutions that are part
of the Racial & Ethnic Minority Acceleration Consortium for Health Equity (REACH) network. In addition, we will
leverage the Administrative Core to conduct a pilot study involving a discrete choice experiment examining AA-
NHPI perceptions and preferences for diabetes medications. We will gain an understanding of AA-NHPI
preferences regarding attributes of diabetes medications through administering patient preference surveys to 50
AA and 50 NHPI with type 2 diabetes. Random utility theory will serve as the basis for analysis. This assumes
that individuals make choices to maximize their utility (or wellbeing), which they derive from different choices.
Mixed logit regression, which allows for heterogeneity in preferences across individuals, will be used to estimate
the random utility models. Results will enable us to better understand the importance of different attributes and
levels, as well as willingness to trade-off between attributes. We will compare findings for AA to those of NHPI
and describe similarities and differences. Sensitivity analysis will be used to test the robustness of the results to
different assumptions and model specifications. We will hire and train a Health Equity Fellow to support the
discrete choice experiment in diabetes medications and build expertise and scholarship for future work and
engagement. Achievement of these aims will enable HAWAI‘I HERON to be an active partner to the FDA Office
of Minority Health and Health Equity in collaborative research efforts to advance minority health and health equity
focused research, to improve outreach and communications, and to support training and mentoring of diverse
students and junior researchers."

Sit-stand transitions, the motions executed by individuals to stand up or sit down, are an important determinant
of overall mobility and a common source of falls. Unilateral amputees using standard passive prostheses are
further challenged by sit-stand transitions due to muscle and joint asymmetries they exhibit between the sound
and amputated sides, often resulting in debilitating back pain. Powered knee-ankle prostheses can produce
enough torque to assist meaningfully during sit-stand transitions and can meet design criteria such as producing
smooth motion on the amputated side that matches the sound side. Controllers for these prostheses can be
designed to allow user-driven control of the leg. However, the production of high torques not directly commanded
by the user comes with increased risks. This is of particular concern because these legs must be adopted outside
of controlled lab environments. Thus, any powered prosthesis must demonstrably meet design and safety
criteria. While safety-critical medical devices, such as pacemakers, are subjected to extensive testing and
validation procedures, there is no agreed-upon standard in the powered prosthetics field for how to define and
measure safety. Prior work on sit-stand controllers has focused only on measuring a limited number of outcomes
with respect to one design criterion on a small number of subjects, providing no guarantees about safety. The
set of techniques known as formal verification provides powerful tools to reason about the behavior of systems
that are composed of interacting mechanical, software, and biological modules. Given a model of a system,
formal verification allows us to probe the system’s behavior over an infinite range of possibilities that cannot be
replicated in the lab during a typical testing session. These methods can then guide real-world testing, and alert
system designers to problematic regions of execution. In this project, I propose to apply formal verification
techniques to design a volitional controller for sit-stand transitions with provable safety guarantees, using
physics-based models and novel mathematical formulations of safety."

Creating and maintaining a community of peers for SUD researchers is key to helping them
advance the inception of new products that deliver solutions for substance use disorders. To
ignite SUD researcher engagement via the online community tools, we must nurture a network
of human connections that exist between former and future program participants, industry
experts, speakers, coaches, and guests of the program to share research ideas and support
each other in the biomedical product development journey. Additional activities proposed to
nurture the Community of Peers continuously and effectively include outreach during the period
when the program is inactive (i.e. most of the year) and will include co-designing post-program
content to keep SUD researchers engaged with the curriculum, proactive previous cohort
involvement with the outreach, recruitment, curriculum delivery to the next cohorts, creation of
areas of focus around which cohorts can self-organize, and organization and on-going delivery
of live connections to top industry experts and peers with management and engineering
expertise. By facilitating a range of activities to curate the budding relationships in this
ecosystem, we create more opportunities for self-driven interactions. Empirical evidence for self-
driven interactions will be measured and fed back into the activities design for subsequent
years."

This program is an extension of our successful HIV basic science training program with the HIV Cure Research
Infrastructure Studies (H-CRIS) based at the University of Ghana - an ongoing collaboration between
Washington University in St. Louis (WU) and the University of Ghana (UG). Finding a permanent cure for people
living with HIV, a key priority for the NIH, requires rigorous and inclusive basic science research. The main
obstacle to an HIV cure is the persistence of transcriptionally silent and immunologically unrecognizable
proviruses in quiescent memory CD4+ T cell reservoirs in people who are on ART. Although over 70% of HIV
patients live in Africa, very little of the basic science of cure research involves African patients or scientists. This
is a clear deficiency in the cure research efforts that needs immediate remedy. Most HIV basic science research
on cure has been conducted in the USA and Europe in Caucasian men and on one viral subtype (HIV subtype
B). However, HIV in Africa predominantly affects women, who are thus excluded from cure research. In addition,
African women living with HIV have co-infections like tuberculosis, hepatitis, and human papillomavirus, which
can all determine CD4+ T cell responses.
Since 2018, a partnership between WU and UG has set up the HIV Cure Research Infrastructure Studies (H-
CRIS) at the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, UG. H-CRIS is training graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows in HIV basic science and cure research with outstanding success; many trainees have
obtained independent grant funding. The parent grant to this supplement will enroll 3 PhDs (4-year program), 4
MPhil (2-year master's with a laboratory research thesis), and provide a two-year intensive basic laboratory
research training and mentorship for four postdoctoral fellows (11 trainees in all). This supplement will train an
additional postdoctoral fellow and a master's student whose basic research into HIV will specifically focus on
questions relevant to women living with HIV in Ghana. Our specific aims are:
1. To build capacity and experience at the University of Ghana for basic science researchers to design and
conduct HIV cure-related research in Ghana.
2. To equip trainees with research skills through 2-year intensive and mentored postdoctoral research projects
focused on HIV basic science and cure.
3. To establish and maintain a mentorship plan for trainees at UG who aspire to become independently funded
investigators in the basic science of HIV research."
11122586,"Project Summary/Abstract
Stress is a risk factor for the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. Over recent years, it is becoming
increasingly clear that dopaminergic circuitry originating in the ventral tegmental area, which is the most well
studied in the context of motivation, is also critical for the behavioral response to stress suggesting an interaction
between stress, motivation, and stress-coping behaviors. Recent studies have determined that the medial
habenulo-interpeduncular nucleus (MHb-IPN) axis, and particularly the IPN responds to aversive stimuli,
contributes to avoidance behavior, and modulates anxiety-like behavior as a component of the extrahypothalamic
stress network. However, the MHb-IPN axis also controls nicotine intake in rodent models, receives dopamine
input from the VTA, and contributes to novelty preference suggesting a role for this pathway in reward seeking
and motivation. Interestingly, we have determined that the IPN GABAergic neurons are activated by acute
stressors; whereas, rewarding stimuli including sucrose reduces activity, which, when mimicked using
optogenetics, reduces stress-induced anxiety-like behavior in mice. These data suggest that one critical function
of the IPN and associated circuitry may be in motivating reward seeking as a stress-coping strategy. However,
neuronal sub-populations underlying this effect are unknown as are the IPN efferents and afferents that mediate
effects of stress on motivated reward seeking. Thus, the goal of this application is to build off these data and test
the hypothesis that IPN neuronal sub-populations, IPN efferents, and IPN afferents drive reward seeking as a
coping mechanism for stress reduction. In Aim 1, we will combine GCaMP expression with fiber photometry and
optogenetics to test if an IPN GABAergic neuron sub-population activated by acute stressors exhibits reduced
activity during reward behaviors and contributes to stress-induced increased motivation for sucrose seeking.
Aim 2 will test if a sub-population of IPN neurons that project to the laterodorsal tegmental area contributes to
reward seeking during stress through modulation of dopaminergic reward circuits. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis
that acute stress engages IPN afferents that are critical for the effects of stressors on reward behavior and
seeking. It is anticipated that elucidating circuitry and mechanisms underlying coping behaviors and effects of
stressors on reward seeking and consumption in an understudied brain region will yield great insights into
behaviors that may be dysregulated in neuropsychiatric disorders and set the foundation for therapeutic
strategies for new treatment."

availability of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP), the current system's requirement for women to visit specific
AIDS centers creates a substantial barrier to access. This proposed study aims to build upon the parent grant's
goals to establish an HIV implementation center in the Caucus region by addressing the research gaps in
women's preferences for PrEP delivery. The focus will be on partners of people who inject drugs, women who
inject drugs, sex workers, and transgender women residing in Tbilisi and Batumi, with a total sample size of 540
women. The recruitment strategy will involve social workers from HIV prevention services, such as needle and
syringe programs and methadone therapy centers, as well as peer workers from partner organizations. The
study will employ a combination of focus groups (with 40 women) and computer-assisted personal interviewing
(with 500 women) using a choice-based conjoint approach. This methodology will explore key aspects of PrEP
delivery that are most important to women, including location, eligibility screening, and adherence support. The
insights gained from this study will be used to design a more women-friendly and accessible PrEP program. The
ultimate goal is to increase the involvement of women at elevated risk of HIV in PrEP, thereby enhancing the

between PR-REACH and the FDA OMHHE. To this end a PR-REACH leadership team, three research cores,
a training and mentoring core, and an advisory team will be created to: 1) employ innovative strategies,
trainings, education, and communication methods to understand Puerto Rican individuals preferences,
experiences and unmet needs regarding FDA approved treatments and medications, 2) leverage big data,
machine learning and artificial intelligence data analysis and local health data sources in PR to be able to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved products (therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines) and
products subject to EUAs/EUA expansion, and 3) identify barriers to clinical trial enrollment for Hispanic Puerto
Ricans and develop innovative strategies to address such barriers. Finally, a pilot study under this consortium
will be conducted (aim 2) to advance the understanding of substance use disorder patients’ journey as
perspectives, preferences and unmet needs regarding substance use disorder (SUD) treatment with FDA
approved medications in PR to be able to improve its outcomes. The PR-REACH will initiate with Hispanics
living in Puerto Rico as a model than can inform and guide subsequent extrapolation to Hispanics in the US.
These activities will be conducted in a 2-year period."

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and diabetic foot infections (DFI) are one of the most challenging complications of
diabetes due to high morbidity and associated mortality and precede the majority of non-traumatic lower limb
amputations in the adult population. Diabetic foot microbiome of intact skin, prior to the onset of the ulcer, is
characterized by the low level of Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE) and high levels of Staphylococcus aureus
(SA). Persistent level of bacteria in ulcer tissue, resulting in prolonged and deregulated inflammation is one of
the leading causes of lower leg amputations in patients suffering from DFUs. To gain greater insight into
relationship between innate immune responses and wound healing outcomes, we propose to study how
commensal microorganism SE prevents intracellular accumulation of SA and accelerates the diabetic wound
healing process. The long term goal of this project is to prevent DFI by understanding the mechanism and
developing new therapeutic strategies targeting cutaneous intracellular pathogens in patients with DFUs. We
have already shown that downregulation of an innate-antimicrobial protein P-2 in keratinocytes and gamma
delta (GD) T cells results in accumulation of intracellular MRSA in DFUs, contributing to persistent unresolved
inflammation. Furthermore, loss of P-2 in murine models is associated with both, lower antimicrobial activity
and accumulation of intracellular MRSA, and impaired epithelialization. Importantly, we have shown that killing
of intracellular MRSA is enhanced in skin after exposure to SE. Based on robust preliminary data we postulate
that SE colonization modifies diabetic skin and wound environment to prevent intracellular infections by
pathogenic SA. Our hypothesis is that intracellular bacteria modify expression and function of P-2 to affect
bacterial clearance and inflammatory response, directly impacting healing in DFU. The objective of this project
is to determine mechanism by which SE prevents intracellular infections by pathogenic SA in a diabetic mouse
and human wounds. We hypothesized that SE colonization modifies wound environment in order to prevent or
resolve persistent bacterial wound infections. To test our hypothesis, we will evaluate SE-mediated induction of
P-2 in professional and non-professional phagocytes during acute diabetic and non-diabetic wound healing
process in vivo, using multiple animal and human models and samples obtained from DFU patients. We will
also identify gene expression signatures and pathways in these cells that are differentially regulated in “low
intracellular SA non-healing” vs “high intracellular SA healing” DFU (Aim 1). We will characterize SE protective
mechanisms against intracellular MRSA in diabetic wound infections (Aim 2). Our findings will provide
important new knowledge regarding the role and mechanisms by which commensal SE may prevent persistent
diabetic wound infections. Targeting intracellular bacteria niche to accelerate healing in diabetic patients at risk
of cutaneous and wound infections has potential to achieve a major clinical impact in promoting healing and
reducing amputations."

HIV-1 vaccines that can elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) are a primary goal. To date, it has been
demonstrated that a single bnAb lineage (VRC01-class) can be specifically activated in human trials. Antibodies
from this trial do not neutralize HIV-1 and heterologous sequential immunization is thought to be required to
develop bnAbs. Heterologous sequential immunization has been employed to generate bnAbs in pre-clinical
models. While VRC01-class antibodies isolated from infected individuals can be quite broad, the limit of breadth
for VRC01-class antibodies induced by these types of vaccination strategies in people is unknown. Therefore,
we are developing an alternative bnAb lineage targeting vaccine (VH1-46 class) through advanced protein
engineering approaches and assessment in newly generated human immunoglobulin knock-in mice harboring
VH1-46 germline antibodies. Further, we are pursuing innovative approaches to develop a dual bnAb lineage
targeting vaccine which could synergize with current VRC01-class vaccines. Individual lineage targeting
vaccines may not succeed at fully maturating these lineages, thus severely limiting the neutralization breadth
and ultimate effectiveness of these vaccines. Dual lineage targeting may be critical for success of the first bnAb-
eliciting HIV-1 vaccine."

applications. While recent years have witnessed breakthroughs in lineage-specific differentiation of hiPSC, the
effect of matrix stiffness, viscoelasticity, and integrin ligand presentation during multi-stage exocrine pancreatic
organoid (exoPO) development remain largely unexplored. Furthermore, current three-dimensional (3D)
matrices for hiPSC culture and differentiation do not provide sufficient controls over matrix biophysical
properties (e.g., viscoelasticity, stiffness) and biochemical motifs (e.g., cell-adhesive ligands). Additionally, no
prior work has employed dynamic xeno-free hydrogels to study the effect of matrix mechanics and cell-
adhesive ligand presentation on the development of hiPSC-derived exoPO. We hypothesize that exoPO
differentiation can be drastically improved by presenting the cells with fine-tuned 3D matrix properties during
the developmental stages. To achieve this goal, we will develop a viscoelastic dynamic double network (DDN)
hydrogel platform with unprecedented tunability in matrix mechanical properties and biochemical motifs.
Specifically, we will control matrix stiffness by forming an elastic hydrogel network with inverse Electron
Demand Diels-Alder (iEDDA) click reaction. We will tune matrix stress-relaxation through a set of linear
polymers complexed by reversible boronate-diol bonding. Uniquely, the elastic iEDDA click hydrogel network
will be engineered to exhibit tunable hydrolytic degradation. On the other hand, the viscoelastic network will
allow conjugation of cell adhesive ligands to permit viscoelasticity mediated engagement of integrins. With this
viscoelastic DDN hydrogel platform, we will define the impact of matrix viscoelasticity, stiffness, and integrin
ligand presentation on multipotent pancreatic progenitor cell differentiation and exoPO formation. In Aim 1, we
will study the role of matrix viscoelasticity on pancreatic progenitor differentiation. In Aim 2, we will describe the
requirements of matrix stiffness during pancreatic progenitor differentiation. In Aim 3, we will identify the role of
cell adhesive ligands on pancreatic ductal/acinar cell specification. In the long-term, this project will produce a
dynamic hydrogel platform to advance the use of chemically-defined matrices as xeno-free artificial stem cell
niches for organoid development and tissue regeneration applications."

Francisco (UCSF), UC San Diego (UCSD), UC Los Angeles (UCLA) and UC Davis (UCD), along with a
network of 21 collaborating institutions in low- to middle-income countries (LMICs), proposes to continue our
successful GloCal Health Fellowship (GloCal). Our LMIC sites are well-established, work in regions with some
of the highest burden of disease, and stand to benefit from our program’s capacity building, mentorship training
and alumni support. GloCal is the only UC-wide global health training program, and our track record shows that
we: 1) Recruit pre- and postdoctoral trainees diverse in discipline and race [39% of U.S. trainees over the past
5 years identify as an underrepresented minority (URM)] who aspire to build interdisciplinary academic
research careers in global health; 2) Provide outstanding, interdisciplinary education and training in global
health in collaboration with faculty mentors from participating UC campuses and collaborating LMIC
institutions; and 3) Provide each trainee with a rich and enduring mentored research experience that fosters
scientific and career development in global health. The program also advances long-term objectives to 1)
Develop models of interdisciplinary, innovative global health research and training designed to ensure healthy
lives and promote well-being for all; 2) Enhance global health networks between the UC and our LMIC partners
and recruit faculty leading innovative global health research; and 3) Strengthen a sustainable and equitable
model of collaboration between the UC and our LMIC partners that develops research capacity that advances
locally-led and locally-relevant research. GloCal will recruit candidates from a pipeline of 65 T32 and 13 D43
programs. GloCal trainees are at different career stages, but all receive: 1) A 9 or 12-month, hands-on
research experience onsite with one of our LMIC partners—LMIC fellows will spend their first 2 to 3 months of
the program at UC and earn a certificate in ‘conducting global health research’; 2) A strong, interdisciplinary
mentored research experience; 3) Instruction in global health through onsite and online courses; and 4) Career
development to ensure that they attain their short-term goals and succeed in transitioning to the next career
stage. GloCal leadership and standing committees ensure that these program components form a seamless,
integrated experience supported by evaluation and continuous improvement. Strengths and innovations of the
program include: 1) A unified consortium under UCGHI that includes four UCs at the leading edge of global
health 2) Recruitment of diverse U.S. trainees across UC and the UCLA-Charles Drew University partnership;
3) Mentors offering training across diverse disciplines (e.g., medicine, nursing, dentistry, public health,
veterinary science, environmental and social sciences) and in research methods; and 4) Leveraging common
resources across the four participating UC campuses (UCGHI, CTSAs and CFARs). UCGHI is committed to
supporting the success of GloCal, as evidenced by their pledge of $600,000 in co-funding."
11126405,"PROGRAM SUMMARY
The objective of our LAUNCH program is to continue our global health research training program called the
Global Health Equity Scholars (GHES) designed to create a new community of researchers, educators, and
professionals who are prepared to address new and emerging global health challenges. We will build on the last
nine years of this training program to create a cadre of new researchers who will dedicate their research careers
to address the health problems that arise out of the inequity of human conditions prevalent in informal human
settlements, also known as slums. Rather than addressing one disease at a time, we propose to provide a
comprehensive, multidisciplinary, and integrated approach to deal with urban and rural informal human
settlement health issues, developed over many years by the participating faculty members of this program. This
program will comprise four US partner institutions (Consortium) - Yale University, Stanford University, University
of Arizona, and University of California at Berkeley, each led by a leader in global health research with more
than 10 years of collaboration among themselves. Together, core faculty mentors from these institutions conduct
research at 25 institutions in 21 countries, representing regions of Africa, Central and South America, the
Caribbean, Asia, the Pacific, and Eastern Europe. The GHES program will address a wide range of health
research topics including HIV/AIDs, emerging and high-consequence infectious diseases, non-communicable
diseases (NCDs), women's health, environmental health, mental health, interpersonal violence, substance
abuse, injuries, and the interaction of all of these health issues within the framework of slum health. Training will
target US postdoctoral fellows and pre-doctoral students and low and middle-income country (LMIC) postdoctoral
fellows. We plan to recruit 9-10 trainees/year with 60% of them as US postdoctoral fellows. The trainees will
spend 10-12-months at an LMIC site under the supervision of the Consortium and their collaborating LMIC
mentors. Workshops on global health research methods, skill development and career development will be
conducted both in-person and online. LMIC trainees will spend 2-3 months at US institutions to undergo training
in methods not provided at their institutions. All of the trainees will be provided with research and career
mentorship throughout their training and tracked for career development after completion of their GHES-
supported research work. Thus, under this program, we expect the trainees to be exposed to one important
theme in global health research - health equity - through research that deals with health concerns of vulnerable
populations residing in informal human settlements and provide them with an opportunity to become experts in
this new global health discipline. The overall impact of this training program is, therefore, to create a new cadre
of global health researchers and leaders who address the emerging health issues arising out of ever-expanding
informal human settlements of LMICs."

Despite the importance of smoking withdrawal symptoms (e.g., craving, negative affect, disrupted cognition)
for understanding tobacco/nicotine dependence and elucidating intervention targets, the parent study is the
first-ever prospective, controlled comparison of abstinence-induced withdrawal between people who use
electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) and those who smoke cigarettes. However, like most research in
the field, we currently exclude people with schizophrenia (SCZ). Lack of representation of people with SCZ is a
major problem in nicotine/tobacco research, contributing to greater tobacco-related health disparities than
perhaps any other population segment, with extremely high rates of use and low rates of cessation, which
contributes to a marked excess in morbidity and mortality. A burgeoning literature is examining ENDS as a
harm reduction approach to tobacco smoking. However, there are major concerns with this direction of
research, particularly for people with SCZ. Though ENDS appear much less harmful than cigarettes, they still
carry neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular consequences, and research on interventions for vaping cessation is
in its infancy. Indeed, the addiction liability of ENDS in people with SCZ is unknown. It is critical that we
understand how withdrawal from ENDS compares to that of cigarettes. Notably, results from the general
population (like the parent study) may not generalize to SCZ as they may be more vulnerable to ENDS
dependency and experience different or more severe withdrawal due to multiple disease-related factors. The
proposed supplement leverages the strengths of the parent study, which focuses on the general population, and
enhances its overall project impact and relevance to health disparities by recruiting a sample of people with
SCZ, half of whom vape ENDS daily and half of whom smoke daily. The supplement will provide novel data on
the effects of 24-hr abstinence from vaping vs smoking on self- report and objective assessments of major
facets of withdrawal in people with SCZ, as well as changes in neuropsychiatric symptoms. It will also provide a
novel comparison of vaping/smoking withdrawal in people with SCZ (the supplemental data) to a matched
group of people without SCZ (from the parent trial) and explore candidate moderators (e.g., antipsychotic
class, sex). Results will provide the first literature on ENDS withdrawal in people with SCZ, who continue to be
an under-represented group in nicotine/tobacco research, despite their facing marked tobacco-related health
disparities (a NIDA strategic plan cross-cutting theme). Results will directly inform the suitability of ENDS for
tobacco harm reduction (NIDA strategic plan priority area #2) in people with SCZ. Moreover, the
comprehensive, multi-modal assessment of withdrawal facets will directly inform the development of ENDS
cessation interventions for people with SCZ."
11125013,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
The viruses belonging to the family Arenaviridae contain several causative agents of hemorrhagic fever in
humans. For instance, Lassa virus causes Lassa fever, which is a major public health threat in endemic regions
of West Africa. Junin virus, Machupo virus, Guanarito virus, Sabia virus, and Chapare virus cause South
American hemorrhagic fevers, severe diseases in humans resulting in high fatality rates. These highly
pathogenic arenaviruses are classified as Risk Group-4 agents, which need to be handled in biosafety level-4
facilities due to their high pathogenicity and lack of vaccines or therapeutics. Additionally, arenaviruses causing
hemorrhagic fevers are listed on Category A Priority Pathogens because of the highest risk to national security
and public health. Thus, countermeasures, such as vaccines or antivirals, against arenavirus infections are
crucial medical needs globally.
Most antiviral agents are inhibitors of proteases or inhibitors of virus replication. In a search for alternative
approaches, we propose to study in more detail the dependence of arenavirus on metabolism of two key
monosaccharides, D-glucose and D-mannose. Our focus will be on using carbohydrate mimetics/antimetabolites
as antivirals. Specifically, we will employ isotopically labeled monosaccharides and molecular probes that
include 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), a D-glucose, and also a D-mannose analog as a reference compund, and
WP1096, a 2-iodo-D-mannose as a novel prototype carbohydrate antimetabolite antiviral. Our results will
enhance the success of designing future carbohydrate antimetabolite antiviral compounds as therapeutics to
alleviate suffering and contain arenaviral outbreaks.
We will address this goal through three specific aims.
Specific Aim 1. Determine the effect of WP1096 and 2-DG (as a control) on glycolysis pathways and viral
glycoproteins of tissue culture cells infected with arenaviruses (LASV, JUNV and MACV).
Specific Aim 2. In vivo evaluation of WP1096 that includes preclinical toxicology, tissue distribution,
pharmacokinetics, and analysis of active metabolites.
Specific Aim 3. Determine the in vivo protective efficacy of WP1096 and 2-DG (as a control) and analyze
their effects on glycosylation patterns and the host glycolysis pathway.
Taken together, we hope to develop promising pan-arenavirus therapeutics and gain the insight for development
of broad spectrum antivirals effective against multiple viral families."
11125014,"Nearly two-thirds of all hospital-related infections are associated with biofilms, and Staphylococcus epidermidis
biofilms are responsible for 40% of infections in hip and knee replacements. The first step in biofilm formation is
bacterial attachment to a surface. This process is mediated by components on the cell wall and the implant
surface. Understanding the mechanism of bacterial surface attachment and methods to prevent it could lead to
novel and innovative approaches for preventing biofilms. The extracellular autolysin protein (AtlE) strongly binds
with polystyrene and serum-coated surfaces, and inhibiting this binding reduces surface attachment and biofilm
formation. Moreover, the R2ab subdomain of AtlE, binds not only polystyrene but also staphylococcal cell wall
components. While polystyrene is a valuable model for studying surface attachment, it is brittle and unsuitable
for biomedical implants. This project will extend prior investigations to a more clinically relevant surface, poly-
methylmethacrylate (PMMA), a material used in orthopedic and dental implants (bone cement). Prior work has
shown that nanoparticles are a valuable model for studying many aspects of protein-surface interaction. Their
colloidal stability and high surface-to-volume ratio enable studies of protein behavior when nanoparticles are
present. By examining protein binding to PMMA nanoparticles, the structural and biophysical determinants that
influence bacterial attachment during biofilm formation will be identified. Strong preliminary data demonstrate
that structural rules for these protein-surface interactions can be determined and manipulated to reduce bacterial
attachment and subsequent biofilm formation. In Aim 1, these “rules of PMMA surface attachment” will be
established using biophysical experiments. The structure and orientation of extracellular S. epidermidis proteins
on PMMA surfaces and serum-coated PMMA surfaces will be determined. In Aim 2, a novel biomaterial surface
functionalization strategy will be developed that reduces protein binding and could dramatically slow biofilm
formation on PMMA surfaces. This strategy will be developed using PMMA nanoparticles and tested on
commercially available bone cement in an in vitro biofilm reactor. Finally, in Aim 3, the R2ab domain will be used
to localize photothermally active nanoparticles to biofilms in an in vivo animal model, testing whether targeted
near-infrared photothermal therapy is a viable treatment for biofilms. Two models will be tested, including a
wound model and an osteomyelitis (bone infection) model. The goal of this basic and preclinical research is to
understand how S. epidermidis surface proteins lead to biofilms on medically relevant surfaces. The mechanistic
details of biofilm formation on PMMA surfaces will improve the understanding of how biofilms form; the new
surface treatments will establish a practical approach for slowing down biofilm development; and the targeted
nanoparticles will lead to more practical strategies for treating established biofilms. Each aspect of this project
addresses a significant challenge in the biofilm field with an innovative and biophysically motivated approach.
Ultimately, this research will lead to a more favorable outcome for patients facing a biofilm infection."

The parent project, UZIMA-DS (UtiliZing Health Information for Meaningful Impact in East Africa through Data
Science), aims to create a scalable and sustainable platform that leverages novel data assimilation
approaches and advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods to improve health
outcomes in two key domains: maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH), and mental health (MH). Led by
the Aga Khan University in East Africa (AKU) and the University of Michigan, UZIMA-DS is a U54 Research
Hub funded under the NIH Data Science for Health Discovery and Innovation in Africa Initiative.
Projects in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) encounter significant challenges with cloud utilization,
such as limited resources, tight budgets, and a lack of expertise in cloud infrastructure. These obstacles hinder
the ability to scale research collaborations within the consortium and beyond. To address these issues, we
propose developing and documenting good practices for building efficient and cost-effective cloud-based data
pipelines for research. We will also address scaling cloud infrastructure responsibly, ensuring that as we
expand, we do so without proportionally increasing our carbon footprint.
We will utilize data pipelines from the ongoing UZIMA-DS project, which processes daily Fitbit data from 500
healthcare workers on a Microsoft Azure instance. This use case will serve as a foundation for building and
evaluating data pipelines using three tools and approaches within the Azure environment. Our primary goal is
to develop and implement good practices for constructing efficient, cost-effective cloud-based data pipelines
that minimize environmental impact. By doing so, we aim to promote sustainable and scalable research
practices in LMIC settings, captured in our motto, “Efficient Data, Sustainable Future for Research.”
The impact of this work includes enhanced research efficiency, cost savings, environmental sustainability, and
empowering the DS-I Africa consortium to adopt sustainable cloud practices."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This application is to request supplement funds for FY25 for CTN-0121: Integrated Care and Treatment for
Severe Infectious Diseases and Substance Use Disorders (SUD) among Hospitalized Patients. The CTN 0121
study is a two-group, randomized controlled trial conducted in six hospitals across the U.S. designed to test the
effectiveness of an integrated infectious diseases (ID)/substance use disorder (SUD) clinical team intervention
approach on improving health outcomes for patients hospitalized with severe injection-related infections (SIRI)
and who endorse injection drug use. The single primary objective of this trial is to determine whether an
integrated SUD and ID care team intervention (SIRI Team) that begins in the hospital and extends after
hospital discharge will be associated with lower mortality and fewer hospital readmissions for patients with the
SIRI Team than with Treatment as Usual (TAU). The primary hypothesis is that the proportion of participants
alive with no hospital readmissions will be higher in the SIRI Team intervention group vs. TAU group at four
months post-randomization. Secondary objectives are to examine differences between the two study groups in
important milestones that may contribute to post discharge recovery, harm reduction, and sustained health:
proportion of participants alive with no hospital readmissions utilizing all time points (4, 8, and 12 months post-
randomization) to ascertain whether differences maintain during longer-run follow-up, completion of antibiotic
course, initiation of other treatment by hospital discharge, receipt of outpatient care post-discharge, retention in
or completion of outpatient care, and change in substance use severity and frequency. The CTN 0121 study
has been developed and is led nationally by the Florida Node Alliance (FNA). The study builds on the FNA’s
record of success in leading and implementing trials in healthcare settings and integrating substance use into
mainstream healthcare and is consistent with the FNA’s aim of delivering integrative models of care for
comorbid SU and HIV in hospital settings (AIM2). The FNA collaborates with other Nodes on the design and
implementation of CTN trials by providing the infrastructure and capabilities required for successful study
execution."
11123644,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Progressive disorders of airway protection, such as swallowing disorders (dysphagia) and cough
disorders (dystussia), are highly prevalent in PD and have significant negative implications for health and quality
of life. In fact, aspiration pneumonia, commonly associated with dysphagia/dystussia, is a leading cause of death
in PD. Despite this, there is currently no established standard of care for the treatment of airway protective
disorders in this population. Even more critically, approximately 40% of individuals with PD in the United States
do not access rehabilitation services or receive specialized care for these potentially life-threatening airway
protective deficits. Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST) and Cough Skill Training (CST) have been found
to improve airway protective disorders in PD and be feasible via telehealth. However, a significant clinical-
research gap remains in that no one has demonstrated that clinical outcomes are comparable (non-inferior)
when these treatments are delivered via telehealth versus in-person – a gap that we are currently working to fill
with our ongoing parent R01(R01 NS126319-01). Furthermore, it is important to assess the impact of patient
burden on treatment adherence and clinical outcomes in the short- and long-term in both modalities. This gap
limits access to these important services with detrimental effects to health, quality of life, and healthcare
disparities. An additional significant gap that impacts the advancement of this important work is a major lack in
doctoral level scholars with strong training and mentorship in the area of clinical-translational work in airway
protection (i.e., swallowing and cough) and its rehabilitation. This challenge is compounded by an especially low
number of trainees from underrepresented backgrounds. Our long-term goal is to improve the health outcomes
of individuals with PD and other neurodegenerative diseases, specifically as they relate to airway protective
dysfunction. This long-term goal will be achieved through validating and improving access to efficacious
interventions and through the effective training and mentorship of a diverse workforce of scholars with expertise
in airway protection and its rehabilitation. The objective of this Landis Mentorship award supplement is to provide
key support to enrich the training experiences of current and future trainees in airway protection. Our current
parent R01 will serve as a living classroom from and through which research and enriching training opportunities
will be developed."
11125008,"During the early phase of infection, Mycobacterium tuberculosis proliferates in macrophages and other
cells, preventing apoptosis by the induction of proteins such as from the Bcl-2 family, leading to necrosis of the
infected cells. Necrosis increases tuberculosis (TB)-associated morbidity by causing tissue destruction,
inducing inflammation, promoting fibrosis, and impairing vascular supply, thereby reducing the penetration of
antimicrobials and immune cells to the areas where they are needed most. We have recently demonstrated
that adjunctive use of navitoclax, an orally bioavailable, pro-apoptotic small molecule Bcl-2 inhibitor (in clinical
trials for cancer treatments), improves bacterial elimination and decreases lung damage in animal models of
TB. Additionally, navitoclax has anti-fibrotic effects, which can reverse and prevent lung fibrosis as well as
promote antibiotic penetration. In fact, post-TB lung damage is a recognized consequence of pulmonary TB,
with associated chronic adverse outcomes beyond the TB treatments, including bronchiectasis, poor lung
function and respiratory symptoms in both adults and children. Our central hypothesis is that navitoclax (or
similar pro-apoptotic drugs) could be used as a cell death mechanism (CDM)-based small molecule, host-
directed therapy (HDT) approach to shorten TB treatments, and prevent post-TB lung damage. To understand
how these novel therapeutics impact the lung immune landscape, remodeling and bacterial clearance, we have
developed several novel, clinically translatable positron emission tomography (PET)-based imaging biomarkers
to longitudinally profile lesional characteristics in live animals: 18F-ICMT-11 for apoptosis, 18F-FAPI-74 for
fibrosis, 11C-rifampin and 18F-pretomanid (both chemically identical to the parent antibiotic) for tissue antibiotic
exposures as well as advanced magnetic resonance and computed tomography imaging to visualize
pulmonary damage and necrosis. Finally, we have developed complementary high-dimensional
immunophenotyping by flow cytometry to assess the lung immune landscape, remodeling and fibrosis. We will
develop CDM-based small molecule HDT approaches for TB treatments, which brings together cutting-edge
technologies and cross-disciplinary expertise in TB pathogenesis (Jain), pulmonary immunology (D'Alessio)
and oncology (Carroll). There are currently no HDTs approved for clinical use for the treatment of pulmonary
TB. Therefore, in this proposal, we will leverage our expertise in animal models of TB, advanced whole-body in
vivo imaging and high-dimensional immunophenotyping to gain mechanistic insights on the role of pro-
apoptotic drugs to shorten treatments for drug-susceptible and multi-drug resistant (MDR) pulmonary TB as
well as to prevent post-TB lung damage. Our goals are to utilize novel pro-apoptotic HDTs to develop short (2-
3 months versus current 4-6 months or longer), and efficacious TB treatment regimens which also prevent /
improve post-TB lung damage, as well as develop novel clinically-translatable imaging approaches to expedite
the development of pro-apoptotic drugs for shortening TB treatments."

The Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) recently published a “roadmap” for the types of medicines that are
needed to support the long-term goal of malaria elimination and eradication. The roadmap consists of a wish list
of target candidate profiles (TCP) and medicines (target product profiles, i.e., TPP). With the most recent revision
to the anti-malarial target candidates and product profiles the MMV highlighted the need for identifying new rapid
acting medicines for active case management while other drugs are needed for chemo-protection and chemo-
prevention with long-acting molecules, and/or parenteral formulations (i.e., TCP-2) (Burrows, JN et al., 2017,
Malaria Journal, 16:26). According to their updated roadmap new drugs are needed to protect populations
entering areas of high endemicity during the final stages of malaria elimination. And drugs with causal liver-
stage activity are needed for chemoprevention to prevent infection or outbreak of resistance during malarial
seasons. This TCP has been modeled on the combination drug atovaquone + proguanil.
As a potent and selective inhibitor of the parasite’s cytochrome bc1 complex ELQ-300 selectively targets
Plasmodium falciparum in the blood and liver stages and even kills parasites developing in the midgut of the
mosquito vector. Unlike atovaquone, ELQ-300 is a selective inhibitor of the Qi site of the targeted enzyme
complex. With support from the NIH and US DOD we created a prodrug, ELQ-331, that is more effective in vivo
due to improved oral bioavailability. This drug has been accepted by the MMV as a Preclinical Candidate for
once-weekly dosing for disease prevention. We have now identified ELQ-596 with significantly improved intrinsic
anti-plasmodial activity in vitro, enhanced efficacy in vivo in a mouse model of the disease and a more extended
bloodstream half-life relative to its progenitor. This application seeks support for optimizing the structural features
of ELQ-596 to provide a Next Generation of ELQs for once-monthly oral prophylaxis in humans. This would
simplify the dosing regimen, improve compliance, decrease the dose and associated costs, and improve
outcomes. Superior molecules will advance through a down-selection test cascade for assessment of selective
potency and lack of mammalian cytotoxicity, metabolic stability, solubility in simulated intestinal fluids, resistance
propensity and mode of action as well as efficacy against blood and liver stage malaria in mice. Prodrugs of
superior molecules will be explored to assess for enhanced oral bioavailability and antimalarial performance over
parent molecules.
Scientists with expertise in the following areas make up the collaborative investigational team: medicinal
chemistry, malaria, molecular parasitology, biochemistry, structural biology, and pharmacology."
11125010,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Respiratory virus infection and intranasal immunization generates antigen-specific T cell and B cell memory
throughout the respiratory tract. This includes a population of tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) that are
uniquely positioned within the mucosa to rapidly recognize and respond to re-exposure with a similar
pathogen. Often these TRM are specific for highly conserved epitopes that are shared across many viral strains
and can therefore provide protection against viral variants. While previous studies have shown that TRM can
mediate protection by limiting viral replication and immunopathology following direct inoculation, it is not known
whether TRM alone can effectively surveil the large surface area of the respiratory epithelium to rapidly identify
and eliminate rare, infected cells during natural transmission events prior to propagation of the infection
throughout the respiratory tract. Furthermore, the TRM antiviral mechanisms that are important for limiting
transmission are unknown, and how these mechanisms impact local innate and epithelial cells inhibit viral
propagation are not well characterized. To address these deficiencies, we have developed a murine model of
Sendai virus transmission, and new experimental tools to establish Sendai virus-specific respiratory tract TRM
without generating Sendai-specific antibody. Our preliminary data show that Sendai-specific respiratory tract
CD8+ TRM protected mice from propagation of infection following transmission events, whereas mice with only
circulating Sendai-specific CD8+ memory T cells were not protected. Finally, in collaboration with Dr. Anice
Lowen (co-I), we have developed a guinea pig model of heterosubtypic influenza virus transmission to
investigate the efficacy of T cell-mediated immunity in limiting transmission of a relevant human pathogen. This
proposal will investigate the characteristics, durability, and molecular mechanisms of respiratory tract TRM that
protect against natural respiratory transmission."

Noroviruses are the leading global cause of acute gastroenteritis, responsible for 685 million total
cases, 200 million pediatric cases, and up to 200,000 deaths in children annually. The long-term
goal of this research project is to define the mechanisms by which intestinal microbiota influence
norovirus pathogenesis and host immunity, and thus identify critical targets for novel therapeutics.
Bile acids are a class of metabolites regulated by microbiota that play opposing roles in norovirus
infections: Host-derived bile acids promote human and murine norovirus infections whereas
microbiota-derived bile acids inhibit infection. Considering that neonates are more susceptible to
norovirus infections and they have a distinct bile acid pool compared to adults that is dominated
by host-derived (proviral) species, our central hypothesis is that altered homeostatic bile acid
metabolism is the central determinant of the increased vulnerability of neonates to norovirus
disease. This will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Test the effect of perturbing the
neonatal bile acid pool on norovirus disease; 2) Determine the mechanism by which microbiota-
metabolized bile acids protect neonates from norovirus disease; and 3) Determine the role of
maternal breast milk bile acids in regulating neonatal susceptibility to norovirus diarrhea. The
proposed research is significant because it will provide mechanistic insight into the role of bile
acid metabolism in norovirus pathogenesis and test therapeutic strategies to reduce disease
severity in infected infants based on this insight. Our studies will also explore the innovative
concept that maternal gut metabolites delivered to neonates via breastfeeding determine neonatal
susceptibility to norovirus diarrhea, laying the groundwork for developing novel infant-specific
therapeutics that target the entero-mammary pathway in the lactating mother. Finally, bile acids
are being increasingly recognized as contributing to other pathologic conditions so understanding
basic aspects of their metabolism and trafficking in the mammalian host has broad applicability."

was designed to recruit all participants from the metropolitan Cleveland area. We began recruitment in October
2021 intending to complete enrollment by the end of April 2024. Midway through the recruitment process, it
was realized our recruitment goal would not be met if recruitment was restricted to the metro Cleveland area.
We decided to conduct a nationwide search for participants meeting the inclusion criteria. Nationwide
recruitment has been successful and will result in enrollment completion by July 2024. The original budget,
however, did not include the additional travel costs associated with a nationwide search. In this proposal, we
are requesting supplemental funding to cover the travel costs associated with the nationwide

11123595,"Project Summary/Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic represents the 3rd outbreak caused by zoonotic transmission of a beta-coronavirus
(beta-CoV) in the last 20 years. Hence there is an urgent need for new vaccine strategies to control the ongoing
pandemic and prevent future CoV outbreaks. mRNA vaccines have emerged as an ideal platform for the
development of rapid-response vaccines, but clinical studies have shown that neutralizing antibody titers elicited
by mRNA vaccines are ~10-fold lower than titers elicited by protein nanoparticle (NP) vaccines. This is a concern
with regards to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) that are less sensitive to vaccine-
induced antibodies. In addition, less than 25% of the world population is fully vaccinated. Thus, rapid-response
vaccine technologies are needed that elicit potent antibody responses with a single injection and/or lower doses,
to ensure lasting protection against VOCs, reduce costs, and accelerate global distribution. Moreover, prevention
of future CoV pandemics requires the development of a universal CoV vaccine that elicits cross-reactive immune
responses against a broad spectrum of CoV strains by focusing responses to conserved epitopes. The scope of
the proposed research is to design and evaluate new vaccine strategies to enhance the potency of mRNA-based
rapid-response vaccines and facilitate universal CoV vaccine development. The proposal is based on the EBR
NP technology, which modifies membrane proteins such as CoV spike (S) proteins to self-assemble into virus-
resembling NPs that bud from the cell surface. NP assembly is induced by inserting a short amino acid sequence
into the cytoplasmic tail designed to recruit proteins from the endosomal sorting complex required for transport
(ESCRT) pathway. Initial studies in mice showed that low-dose injections of EBR NPs presenting the SARS-
CoV-2 S protein elicited 10-fold higher neutralizing antibody titers than soluble S protein and protein-based NPs
that displayed the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein. The EBR NP technology will be applied to
accomplish three goals: i) Design a hybrid mRNA vaccine encoding the modified SARS-CoV-2 S-EBR construct
that would be expressed at the cell surface and self-assemble into virus-resembling NPs to elicit more potent
antibody responses than the approved Pfizer/Moderna vaccines, while retaining the manufacturing properties
and T-cell activation of mRNA vaccines. ii) Engineer S-EBR NPs to package and deliver S or S-EBR mRNA
vaccines as an alternative to lipid NPs. This delivery approach would enhance mRNA vaccine potency as S
proteins presented on S-EBR NPs induce potent antibody responses, facilitate efficient intracellular delivery, and
target mRNA vaccines to tissues that are naturally infected by SARS-CoV-2 to induce local immune responses.
iii) Design and evaluate mosaic S-EBR NP-based universal CoV vaccine candidates that present full-length
membrane-associated S proteins from multiple CoV strains to elicit cross-reactive immune responses against a
broad spectrum of CoVs and protect against future outbreaks. The proposed vaccine strategies could have direct
impact on the COVID-19 global health crisis and advance our emergency preparedness for the next pandemic."

editing
PROJECT SUMMARY:
New mutations are a source of adaptive evolutionary novelty but can also cause genetic diseases and cancer.
While we can now correct detrimental mutations using CRISPR/Cas9 technologies, DNA modifications can have
unintended consequences through seemingly unpredictable epistatic and environmental interactions, as could
well be the case for the presumed HIV-resistance mutations in CCR5 recently CRISPRed into humans. In higher
eukaryotes, fitness or health traits such as adaptability or disease susceptibility appear to be controlled by
numerous mutations acting in concert – they are so-called polygenic or complex traits. Such mutations might
even manifest detrimental in some environments while beneficial in others, therefore also called antagonistic
pleiotropic. The main goal of the proposed work is to use the versatile model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to
enhance the predictability and control of the polygenic and antagonistic fitness effects of mutations.
Results from this project will provide universal principles to deepen our understanding of complex human genetic
disease and inform the safe correction or avoidance of harmful mutations in the future.
 Specifically, I will pursue the following aims: 1) predicting polygenic fitness effects across
environments, 2) improving fitness by controlling deleterious and beneficial mutations using
multiplexed genome editing and mutator alleles. Arabidopsis thaliana is an ideal model to tease apart the
fitness effects of mutations in complex environments due to its high malleability to engineered mutations, and its
extensive community and resources. The 1001 Arabidopsis Genome Project and a genome-wide Knock-Out
(KO) collection allow for quantifying fitness of thousands of publicly available natural and artificial mutations
across environments. Building a global network of Arabidopsis researchers, we have started an experiment with
the same natural strains in 45 locations, which I will use to quantify environment-associated mutation effects.
Integrating this with information of relevant KO lines, I will build on my previous predictive models to understand
the effects of mutations on fitness across environments, and the features that make them deleterious. Such a
deep understanding of mutation effects will ultimately allow us to alter fitness in predictable ways. I will test this
in two ways: First, using multiplexed CRISPR base-edits, I will substitute detrimental for beneficial mutations.
Second, to study how accumulating mutations impact fitness and to learn how to correct this, I will engineer
plants with known mutator and anti-mutator alleles. These alleles, associated with the DNA repair machinery
and cancer susceptibility, can increase or decrease the mutation rate in A. thaliana, helping us explore mutation
accumulations up to lethal levels in many mammals. Overall, my research will provide fundamental insights into
the genetic control of complex fitness traits, ultimately paving the way to improving personalized genomic disease
risk predictions and safely probing the limits of poly-gene therapies."

Estrogen-containing hormonal contraception and injectable progestin-only contraception have been associated
with venous thromboembolism (VTE) and stroke in the general population. However, little is known about the
safety of these contraceptive methods among people with sickle cell disease (SCD) even though around 25%
of people with SCD experience VTE with a mean age at diagnosis early in the reproductive lifespan. This
critical gap in knowledge affects contraceptive counseling from both the clinician and patient’s perspectives. In
fact, unplanned pregnancy is more common among people with SCD than the general population suggesting
this population faces multifaceted impediments to contraceptive access. Further, the burden of having a
serious chronic disease is compounded by the fact that, in the United States, SCD disproportionately affects
people with African ancestry (1 in 365 births) and the responsibility of contraception largely falls on women.
Thus, people with SCD are more likely to experience a high burden of social stressors, socioeconomic
disadvantage, and poor quality of life; all of which may contribute to sub-optimal contraception use. Our
overarching goal is to improve the quality of care for people with SCD by assessing the safety of different
hormonal contraceptive methods in this population and by holistically evaluating patient and provider factors
that affect the use of different contraceptive options. To address this goal, we will leverage health system data
from Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States, which includes approximately 1,642 women with SCD enrolled
from 2001-2022. We will augment these data with patient surveys and semi-structured interviews of their
providers. Our research will be guided by a Patient Advisory Board. Aim 1 will use health system data to
compare the risk of SCD complications (VTE, stroke, myocardial infarction, and SCD pain crisis) for people
initiating estrogen-containing contraception versus progestin-only contraception. We will use the state-of-the-
art target trial emulation framework to compare people initiating different contraceptives methods (new user-
active comparator design). Aim 2 will evaluate which patient characteristics are associated with the use of
different types of hormonal contraception using health system data and patient survey data (n=250) that
address the knowledge and attitudes of people with SCD towards different contraceptive methods. Aim 3 will
use semi-structured interviews, informed by a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design, to evaluate the
knowledge and beliefs of clinicians (n=25) regarding hormonal contraception for people with SCD. Impact: This
work addresses the NICHD priority Effects of Long-Term Contraceptive Use on Health with a special focus on
racial minorities and people with chronic conditions by directly assessing the safety of different contemporary
contraceptive methods in an historically understudied population. Further, by examining patient and clinician
factors that affect contraception choice, this work will provide the foundation for a future study evaluating how
best to integrate our findings about contraceptive safety and preferences into clinical practice."
11125015,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rodent-borne orthohantaviruses (hereafter, hantaviruses) are an important group of zoonotic bunyaviruses
associated with over 50,000 annual diagnosed cases of disease worldwide, primarily caused by rodent-to-human
transmission, but also by direct human-to-human contact. Infections by some hantaviruses are associated with
severe disease with up to 40% case-fatality rates. No FDA-approved countermeasures are currently available to
prevent or treat hantavirus infections and disease. Hantaviruses and other members of the order Bunyavirales
(bunyaviruses) encode complex membrane polyproteins that undergo processing and maturation to liberate
virion-incorporated glycoprotein complexes (Gn/Gc). The Gn/Gc complexes mediate viral entry and are the major
targets of the antiviral host antibody response and therapeutic antibodies. Despite their critical roles and the
likelihood that their interactions with host factors provide conserved Achilles’ heels for the development of broadly
acting antivirals, the biogenesis and vesicular trafficking of Gn/Gc complexes remain poorly understood. Here,
we propose to delineate the mechanisms of intracellular assembly, maturation, trafficking, and activity
of glycoprotein complexes from four rodent-infecting hantaviruses representing the Old and New World
clades and causing two distinct human diseases. These complexes are assembled in the ER and then transit
to the Golgi complex, where they are retained to assemble into virions. Our previous studies have identified a)
key mutations in the Old-World Hantaan virus (HTNV) Gn/Gc that relocalize a substantial amount of Gn/Gc to
the plasma membrane, and b) multiple members of the ER membrane complex (EMC) as hits in a haploid genetic
screen for host factors for the New-World Andes virus (ANDV). Using a combination of genetic, virologic, and
mass-spectrometric approaches, our interdisciplinary team plans to identify and define virus-host interactions
required for ER/Golgi retention of Gn/Gc proteins and elucidate the role(s) of the EMC in viral entry and
replication. Our long-term goals are to generate fundamental knowledge about the mechanisms of glycoprotein
biogenesis and function that drive hantavirus infection and create novel avenues for therapeutic intervention
against these agents."

Viral Immunity and Vaccination (VIVA) Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) will carry out a
comprehensive program for assessing the dynamic human immune responses to vaccination. The VIVA HIPC
will leverage recent advances in human immune profiling methods to characterize the diverse states of the
human innate immune system before and after vaccination against these infectious diseases using novel
immune phenotyping and genomics strategies that generate data and tools to be used for downstream data
analysis and functional investigations. We will generate human immune profiles and signatures for vaccinations
against SARS-CoV-2 (Project 1), seasonal influenza (Project 2) and dengue viruses (Project 3). We will use
holistic approaches to provide cutting-edge standardized and qualified `omics' assays to assess cellular and
serological Immune responses to vaccinations, genomics/transcriptomics, including scRNAseq, CITEseq and
spatial tissue transcriptomics, and experimental vaccinations in primary human tonsillar histocultures in Projects
1, 2 and 3. We will perform data mining, bioinformatics analyses across data sets, and modeling for integration
of the `omics' datasets to identify the network components and infer their interactions and correlations important
for outcomes. The VIVA HIPC will make the data available for use by the research community and provide the
analyses and immune profiles generated to the scientific community. We will couple our local data infrastructure
to ImmPort to ensure full and timely release of clinical, sample, and experimental meta-data in synchrony with
genomic data releases to standard data repositories. The multi-disciplinary team of investigators with
complementary expertise in viral immunology, viral pathogenesis, vaccinology, genomics and data analysis, will
ensure the success of the VIVA program."
11127080,"Project 2 will determine the extent to which metabolic conditions and immunometabolic programming
impact the ability to recruit new T-cell clonotypes with memory-like features. HIV-infected individuals
harbor pre-existing HIV-specific T cells that were insufficiently potent to control initial infection and that will
likely remain ineffective even after expansion in number following therapeutic vaccination. We propose that
metabolic control over the response to vaccination can positively bias the response by limiting expansion of
exhausted T cells and allowing expansion of long-lived memory cells that can control viral replication after
treatment interruption. If so, then control over host and specifically T-cell metabolism may be required to
design impactful therapeutic T-cell vaccines that transform the host immune response to HIV.
We believe that fully understanding T-cell responses in human populations will require better understanding of
how host metabolism controls T-cell differentiation. Furthermore, manipulation of metabolic pathways,
especially amino-acid sensing pathways, may offer a mechanism for greater control over the quality of the T-
cell response elicited by therapeutic vaccination.
This project will use metabolic profiling via plasma metabolomics, RNAseq, and SCENITH to (i) understand the
extent to which metabolic profiles are associated with success in completed therapeutic-vaccine trials, and (ii)
test if metabolic regulation can alter the trajectory of T-cell development in response to therapeutic vaccines.
We hypothesize that successful vaccines leverage immunometabolic programming to restrain pre-existing
memory CD8+ T cells from expanding and promote outgrowth of broadly reactive new CD4+ and CD8+
clonotypes with stem-like qualities.
Aim 1: Using samples from therapeutically vaccinated humans and non-human primates, identify
metabolomic features that predict T-cell differentiation patterns, breadth, and/or control over viremia in
ATI. In this aim, we test if rich metabolomic data (plasma analytes, bulk RNAseq, and SCENITH) from
macaques and humans can predict both the quality of T-cell responses generated by therapeutic vaccination
and the virus control achieved after ATI.
Aim 2: Examine the systemic and T cell-specific metabolomic impact of SIV vaccines co-delivered with
either supplemental arginine or the arginine-catabolizing enzyme, arginase 1, and the effect on viremia
after ART cessation. mTOR regulates cellular metabolism based on integration of nutrient-sensing systems,
including those that measure availability of amino acids. Vaccine-mediated modulation of amino-acid
catabolism could therefore provide a route to local and limited metabolic regulation that encourages a
transformative and effective T-cell response."
11127795,"Abstract
Cervical cancer is the most common cancer among women in many low- and middle-income countries,
including Kenya. This is mainly due to the lack of screening, which remains the cornerstone of prevention for
the over one hundred million reproductive-aged women who fall outside the target age group or live in
countries where the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is not available. While HPV-based screening has
the potential to be incorporated into simplified protocols, the laboratory testing component requires programs to
have capacity to track specimens, results and patient follow-up, which can be a challenge in settings with
limited healthcare infrastructure and no electronic medical records. Further, low baseline knowledge of HPV
and cervical cancer risk in the community is associated with low rates of screening and follow-up, making
effective outreach and education a key component of screening programs. This work is often done by
community health volunteers (CHVs) with limited content-specific training. We propose to fill these gaps
through an integrated digital platform that includes a mobile app (mSaada) that supports CHVs with patient and
specimen tracking and follow-up, and counseling and protocol support. In the R21 phase of this project, we will:
(1) work with key stakeholders and local and international developers to finalize the mSaada platform, building
on the existing prototype to add patient and specimen tracking functionality; and (2) carry out a pilot study to
identify the patient, provider and health system factors necessary to design a trial to evaluate mSaada
effectiveness and implementation factors. We will carry out a six-month pilot in two health facilities providing
HPV-based screening, and use performance metrics including system usage rates, workflow observations and
qualitative data to guide the planning of a cluster-randomized clinical trial (c-RCT) to determine effectiveness of
mSaada. In the R33 phase of the project, we will use a hybrid implementation effectiveness design to: (1)
conduct an 18-month c-RCT across 12 health facilities to determine the impact of mSaada on cervical cancer
screening uptake, treatment acquisition and cervical cancer knowledge levels among women in the community;
and (2) measure the requisite implementation factors for mSaada effectiveness, sustainability, and scale-up.
The rigorous study design will allow us to determine the clinical impact of mSaada, ensure the local and
regional infrastructure has the capacity necessary for sustainability and develop strategies for widespread
implementation and scale-up. Collaboration with key stakeholders from the Kenya Ministry of Health will
facilitate the development of a long-term sustainability plan as the country moves toward HPV-based cervical
cancer screening. We anticipate the mSaada platform will play a pivotal role in facilitating the introduction of
HPV-based screening programs that can reach women in settings with limited health care infrastructure."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as “NOT-CA-
24-044”.The ultimate goal of this proposal is to address a fundamental gap in knowledge on the role of CCNE1
driving metabolism in uterine serous carcinoma (USC). The results from these studies could have a significant
impact on the mechanistic understanding of the ~20-30% of USC tumors with CCNE1 amplification. This re-
search plan focuses on assessing the homologous recombination (HR) proficiency of CCNE1hi USC and the
contribution of nucleocytoplasmic acetyl-CoA metabolism and its associated histone acetylation to this pheno-
type. Moreover, they will provide a more global understanding of metabolic reprogramming in CCNE1hi USC and
identify novel therapeutic strategies to synergize with standard-of-care DNA damaging chemotherapies. The
completion of the scientific aims of this proposal will not only provide new mechanistic insights into the interplay
between the acetyl-CoA-mediated metabolic-epigenetic axis in USC, but will also establish targeting metabolism
in this highly aggressive disease. The proposed research is of high impact because little is known about molec-
ular mechanisms driving CCNEhi USC. Moreover, these studies have the potential to impact the management of
CCNEhi USC."
11123076,"Of the millions of patients who live through critical illness annually, Intensive Care Unit (ICU)
survivorship is marked by a dementia-like brain injury called post-ICU long-term cognitive impairment
(ICU-LTCI) that creates grave difficulties with managing medications, handling finances, living
independently, and maintaining employment. Data from our group and others show that 50% of ICU
survivors suffer from ICU-LTCI and that the number of veterans who develop ICU-LTCI is as high as
the number of patients with new traumatic brain injury diagnoses among all Active Duty, National
Guard, and Reserves. Our pilot randomized “Returning to Everyday Tasks Utilizing Rehabilitation
Networks-I” (RETURN-I) study showed that a 12-week cognitive rehabilitation intervention (versus
controls) improved executive dysfunction. We then transformed this non-computerized resource-
intensive strategy into a novel, efficient, and scalable Computerized Cognitive Rehabilitation (CCR)
approach. This plasticity-based adaptive CCR was applied to ICU survivors enrolled in our
uncontrolled case-series (RETURN-II) that signaled improvements across multiple cognitive domains.
 Building on nearly two decades of aging brain research with the VA-Tennessee Valley
Healthcare System Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center (VA-TVHS GRECC), we
propose this randomized controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of CCR for survivors with ICU-
LTCI. The RETURN-III Study will be the next logical data-driven approach to create real-world
solutions for Veterans and civilians surviving critical illness with disabling ICU-LTCI.
 The RETURN-III Study will test the hypotheses that a 12-week CCR intervention in medical
and surgical ICU survivors will reduce the severity of cognitive impairment (Aim 1), and result in
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) changes of decreased brain atrophy, greater functional
connectivity, and greater cerebral blood flow (Exploratory Aim 2).
 To test these hypotheses, the RETURN-III study will randomize 160 medical and surgical VA
ICU survivors with documented ICU-LTCI up to 14 days post-hospital discharge to either 12-weeks of
intervention using CCR (n=80) vs. control of non-specific computer games (n=80). At 3, 6, and 12
months post-randomization, trained research personnel blinded to group assignment will use a
validated battery to assess global cognition [primary outcome] (Aim 1: domains of processing
speed, working memory, episodic memory, executive function), and to investigate 12-month MRI
imaging metrics [exploratory outcome] (Aim 2: standard structural and anatomic protocols, baseline
blood oxygenation level dependent responses, pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling)."

11126521,"The incidence of melanoma is increasing rapidly in the VA population in the United States, and sun
exposure during US military service has been linked to increased melanoma incidence. The standard of care
for advanced melanomas includes molecular-targeted therapies of BRAF and MEK inhibitors, as well as
immunotherapies with checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD1. However, between 25% to 70% of advanced
melanoma patients either do not respond or relapse from the current treatments. Therefore, discovering
effective new therapies for malignant melanoma is still a pressing issue in the VA patient care mission.
 BH3 mimetics are a potent new class of cancer treatments that inhibit the BCL-2 dependent anti-apoptotic
defenses inherent in cancer cells. Standard care plus an inhibitor against BCL-2 (Venetoclax) gave a
response rates as high as ~80% in hematological malignancies. However, treatment with a single BH3 mimetic
is insufficient to kill solid tumors, likely due to the presence of uninhibited BCL-2 family members. MCL-1
inhibitors, currently in clinical trials, can potentially boost treatment effectiveness when paired with clinically
established BH3 mimetics. Further, most studies with BH3 mimetics focus on their ability to kill tumor cells
directly, while their potential to enhance immunotherapies remains to be explored. The objective of this
project is to test the combination treatment of MCL-1 inhibitors with other BH3 mimetics or with
immunotherapy (anti-PD-1) in the treatment of melanoma, especially for melanoma tumor cells
unresponsive to current treatments.
 Our preliminary data have indicated that MCL-1 inhibitors, when combined with ABT-263, can
synergistically kill both the bulk of melanoma tumor cells and the melanoma initiating cells (MICs). The
melanomas included those relapsed from current therapies. Further, in an immune competent model for
melanoma (B16 in C57BL6 mice), a MCL-1 inhibitor increased the efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy (Preliminary
Studies). We hypothesize: 1) MCL-1 inhibitors, as part of combination therapies, can overcome the resistance
of melanoma patients to current treatments. 2) This elimination of tumor cells can be achieved either through
direct killing or through modulating the antitumor immune response of tumor microenvironment. We also have
access to a large collection of melanoma short-term cultures and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models from
the University of Colorado Melanoma Tissue Bank. Most of these materials were derived from melanomas of
patients who had relapsed from the current treatments, with whole exosome and RNA-seq data available; they
will provide the unique opportunity to test our hypotheses. Aim 1 will determine the mechanism(s) at play in the
combination of MCL-1 inhibitors and ABT-263. We will further test the hypothesis that the combination of
multiple BH3 mimetics, targeting MCL-1 plus other pro-survival BCL-2 family members, will overcome the
resistance of melanoma cells to current therapies, in vitro and in vivo. Aim 2 will determine the efficacy and
mechanisms of MCL-1 inhibitors to potentiate immunotherapies. We will test the hypothesis that MCL-1
inhibitors potentiate immunotherapies through blocking suppressive immune cell populations and increasing
antitumor immunity in immune-competent mouse models.
 In summary, this proposal extends our promising preliminary studies using MCL-1 inhibitors as partners in
drug combinations designed to overcome melanoma resistance to standard therapies. The expected
outcome of exploring these new clinical-trial-ready BH3 mimetics will likely improve patient outcomes,
especially for patient groups in dire need for alternative strategies. Results will likely lead to a positive
impact on melanoma treatments, identifying new therapies for treating melanoma patients who have
exhausted their other options."
11126910,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurogenerative disorder characterized by early deposition of amyloid-beta
protein (Aβ) followed by tauopathy and impaired cognition. Innovative treatment strategies are needed. Recent
studies in amyloidosis and tauopathy model mice have shown that chronic 40Hz gamma entrainment using
sensory stimuli (GENUS) improves pathological and behavioral outcomes. However, these exciting studies
have not been independently replicated and optimal methods to reduce pathology by gamma entrainment are
unknown. Thus, here, we test whether optogenetic excitation of non-cholinergic basal forebrain parvalbumin
neurons (BF PV) enables widespread control of gamma oscillations throughout cortex and hippocampus to
treat amyloidosis/tauopathy and restore hippocampal-cortical oscillatory functions that support memory.
 The mentored (K99) phase of this proposal will use 5XFAD mice to test benefits of 40Hz optogenetic BF
PV excitation in preventing amyloidosis. All experiments record ipsilateral local field potentials (LFP) in medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HPC). The first experiment directly compares the efficacy of 40Hz
BF PV excitation treatment against GENUS in reducing plaque pathology. The second experiment uses
chemogenetics to model pharmacologically targeting of BF PV and tests whether chemogenetic BF PV
excitation and GENUS synergize to improve outcome. The third experiment assesses the hypothesis that
chronic 40Hz BF PV excitation repairs gamma generating mechanisms in hippocampus and cortex to restore
oscillatory communication and rescue working memory. The fourth experiment will use a closed-loop
stimulation method to deliver two brief (10ms) laser pulses at the peak or trough of hippocampal theta phase to
assess whether theta-phase specific timing of BF PV excitation matters.
 The independent (R00) phase studies will apply methods learned during the K99 phase to 3xTg
amyloidosis/tauopathy model mice to strengthen the case for BF PV targeted treatments of moderate to severe
AD. The same four experiments as above are proposed for these studies in 3xTg mice. Further, important
preclinical behavioral experiments will assess the hypothesis that BF PV excitation can be used to enhance
cognition in 3xTg mice without affecting motivation (a potential side effect) or reinforcement (abuse potential).
 The training plan for this award includes mentorship from an expert team of Harvard Medical School
professors specializing in BF regulation of cortical oscillations and cognition. AD-directed training will be
provided by additional members of the mentorship team from Boston University and through the candidate's
participation in the Massachusetts AD Research Center Research Education Component program. The
proposed AD research and didactic activities and training on the study of neural oscillations will facilitate the
applicant's goal of becoming an independent investigator studying preclinical treatments for AD."

Since its inception in 2012, the UJMT Fogarty Global Health Fellows Program—led by the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, Johns Hopkins University, Morehouse School of Medicine, and Tulane University—has
provided a critical pathway to global health research careers. Our 252 trainees have collectively secured $88.5
million in grant funding, a nearly 600% return on the NIH’s investment. During the current grant cycle (2017-
present), our 110 doctoral scholars and postdoctoral fellows have published a collective 287 manuscripts,
including 109 as primary author. The vast majority remain involved in global health research and many have
already obtained independent grant funding. In the coming grant cycle (2022-2027), under the new LAUNCH
initiative, we build upon these strengths to further improve and expand our program. First, we will provide
enriching 12-month mentored training opportunities at affiliated research sites in 16 countries. We draw upon a
talented pool of US and international candidates, jointly recruited from 12 domestic and 17 international training
programs funded by the NIH. Our expert mentors support experiential learning on site, while the program
provides a central training framework that monitors progress through individual development plans, core skills
checklists, and regular group check-ins. Over the course of the five-year award, we expect to support at least 60
positions via base funding; in line with the RFA, 60% will be US postdoctoral fellows. Second, we will continue
to foster research in scientific areas identified by in-country stakeholders. This includes topics described in the
RFA (e.g., HIV/AIDS, non-communicable diseases, cancers, mental health, neurologic disorders), as well as
other longstanding priorities within our host countries (e.g., infectious diseases, women’s health, child health,
environmental health). Third, we will enhance our training curriculum. We have developed a new Research
Leadership Academy for Global Health, building upon our team’s experience in global health and leadership,
institutional resources, and collaborations with other US government programs. We also provide individually
guided research methodology training and scientific writing support, using proven approaches. Fourth, we will
increase the participation of underrepresented groups in global health research, by identifying and addressing
barriers, emphasizing diversity in recruitment efforts, fostering diversity during the fellowship year, and
supporting a pipeline of future candidates. Fifth, we will monitor, evaluate, and learn from our activities to
iteratively improve the quality of our trainee experience. We utilize a conceptual framework that considers both
process and performance to ensure that the specific aims of the program are met. Finally, the UJMT LAUNCH
initiative will be led by a team of committed global health researchers—and a broad network of engaged
collaborators, both in the US and abroad—with the expertise and experience to carry out its ambitious aims.
Through this program, we will train a diverse group of productive, independently funded, research leaders who
are prepared to tackle the most pressing global health issues in the years to come."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-
24-044. Uterine cancer (UC) is the fourth most common cancer in women and the most common gynecological
malignancy. Unfortunately, both incidence and mortality are rising for UC, while survival rates are falling. In fact,
UC is the only cancer type in which patients had a worse 5-year survival rate in 2012 than they did in 1975, and
in 2024 UC is projected to surpass ovarian cancer as the deadliest gynecologic malignancy. Uterine serous
carcinomas (USC) are a particularly aggressive form of UC, making up only 10% of UC cases but accounting for
approximately 40% of deaths that disproportionally impact Black women. Although some progress has been
made to improve therapies in this aggressive and lethal subtype of UC, there is much work to be done to improve
the outcomes of women diagnosed with this terrible disease. One treatment avenue that shows particular
promise is modulation of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which includes diverse cell types that support the
tumor such as immune cell populations, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. The TME in UC is
likely to change with patient age, as ovarian hormone levels are drastically lower, tumor stage, as tumor cells
encounter new cell types as they invade further from the endometrium, and tumor subtype, as changes in tumor
cell behavior alter the surrounding TME. To determine these important features of the TME in USC, we will use
single cell RNA-seq on freshly collected USC and UEC tumors as well as normal uterine samples. This rich
dataset will provide an atlas of cell types and gene expression patterns found across UC tumors, which will be
valuable for the community as a whole. We will use this dataset to ask 3 key questions:
 1) How does patient age impact the microenvironment of the normal endometrium and USC?
 2) What are the TME differences across different stages of USC?
 3) How does the TME of USC compare to the TME of UEC?
The resulting data and analyses will provide a portrait of the different cell types in the TME and the gene
expression patterns that each cell type exhibits. The findings will provide a strong foundation for further study of
the TME in USC, which will hopefully lead to novel treatment approaches that target the TME, biomarkers that
predict therapy response, and strategies to improve current TME targeting therapies."

dementias via impaired mitochondrial function and/or a reduced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF). Our previous work indicated that enhancing the availability of nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD+) improves physical performance and cognition in aged mice and may reduce
cognitive decline and support sleep quality by boosting mitochondrial function and enhancing BDNF
expression. We propose to build upon a VA-funded randomized clinical trial investigating the effects of
supplementation with the NAD+ precursor, nicotinamide riboside, a form of vitamin B3, upon physical
performance in older adults, by examining the benefits of NR on sleep quality, objective sleep duration,
and cognition in older adults. To accomplish these goals, we will assess sleep quality, objective sleep and
cognitive function, as well as examine serum levels of BDNF of participants who receive a three-month
supplementation with NR or placebo. This proposal will confirm the potential of NR as a low-risk and
low-cost intervention for both healthy sleep and optimized cognitive function."
11126975,"Project Summary: Anti-cancer drug treatments often do not completely eradicate all cancer cells in the body,
leaving behind “drug-tolerant persister” cancer cells (DTPs) that can ultimately develop drug resistance to
cause tumor recurrence. The long-term goal of this line of investigation is to identify therapeutically targetable
vulnerabilities in DTPs to drive the development of treatment strategies for human malignancies. In estrogen
receptor alpha-positive (ER+) breast cancer, DTPs can persist for years despite endocrine therapies that
inhibit ER activity directly or via estrogen deprivation, causing tumor recurrences over a >20-year period. The
overall objective of this project is to determine how ER+ breast cancer cells utilize metabolic reprogramming to
tolerate and eventually overcome endocrine therapy. The central hypothesis is that ER+ breast cancer cells
survive endocrine therapy through a reversible metabolic switch that increases fatty acid metabolism,
mitochondrial respiration, and a protective oxidative stress response. The rationale for this project is that
definition of the metabolic vulnerabilities of DTPs in ER+ breast cancer will enable the rational development of
therapeutic strategies to suppress or eradicate DTPs and prevent cancer recurrence. The central hypothesis
will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) Identify vulnerabilities in fatty acid metabolism and respiration
in DTPs surviving endocrine therapy in ER+ breast cancer; (2) Define the role of the oxidative stress response
in the persistence of DTPs in ER+ breast cancer; (3) Determine the degree of plasticity of metabolic
reprogramming in ER+ breast cancer during disease progression from endocrine tolerance to resistance. In the
first aim, endocrine therapy-induced changes in respiration and fatty acid metabolism will be measured in ER+
breast cancer cells grown in vitro and in vivo as orthotopic cell line- and patient-derived xenografts that yield
spontaneous metastases. Using pharmacological inhibitors of key metabolic signaling nodes, these studies will
determine contributions of fatty acid metabolism and respiration to DTP survival. The second aim will identify
the timing and contributions of oxidative stress and the oxidative stress response to breast cancer cell
persistence during endocrine therapy. In the third aim, we will analyze the role of metabolic adaptation in the
acquisition and maintenance of resistance to estrogen deprivation in human tumor tissues and preclinical
models. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it focuses on (a) identifying
vulnerabilities in DTPs to be exploited therapeutically, and (b) determining how adaptations in DTPs enable
drug resistance, which will drive the rational development of drugs to prevent and manage recurrence. The
proposed research is significant because it will provide strong scientific rationale for the development and
future clinical trials of treatment strategies leveraging metabolic vulnerabilities in ER+ breast cancer, and yield
mechanistic insight into the metabolic plasticity of cancer cells."

Title: Synthetic glycosaminoglycan mimetics as regulators of megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis.
Key Words: Platelets, Glycosaminoglycans, thrombopoiesis, G6b-B, NSGMs
The Candidate is an NIH K12 postdoctoral scholar on an academic career path. His focus is on the roles of
glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in thrombopoiesis. He has significant research experience studying GAG–protein
interactions, and a strong background in organic synthesis notably, the preparation of aromatic-scaffold-based
GAG mimetics known as non-saccharide GAG mimetics (NSGMs), which are functional mimics of GAGs. Career
Development Plan: This proposal is well structured and involves 2 years of mentored research training, which
will ensure that the candidate develops advanced research skills critical for an independent academic career.
He has assembled an advisory committee of experienced and well-funded PIs, with proven track records of
mentoring young academic researchers. He also has a well-resourced environment for the proposed research.
Research Plan: The number of circulating platelets is tightly balanced through continuous production and
removal of platelets to prevent potentially detrimental thrombosis. Platelets are produced through sequential
processes, wherein hematopoietic stem cells commit to the formation of megakaryocytes (megakaryopoiesis),
which release cytoplasmic extensions into the blood stream to produce platelets (thrombopoiesis). While some
mechanisms and molecular regulators of these process have been identified, much remains to be elucidated. Of
these, the roles of extracellular matrix and GAGs are poorly characterized. Although GAGs are regulators of
various proteins, their heterogeneous nature and the challenges associated with obtaining homogeneous forms
of these complex biomacromolecules remain bottlenecks for elucidating their biological roles. Our lab has
developed a diverse chemical library of NSGMs which possess an aromatic scaffold carrying multiple sulfate
groups mimicking the sulfated sugar scaffold of GAGs. NSGMs bind and selectively modulate several GAG-
binding proteins involved in diseases, and thus serve as excellent chemical biology probes of GAG function. We
have identified G4.1, a flavonoid-based NSGM as having potent thrombopoietic potential in vitro and in vivo. Our
preliminary studies show that G4.1 binds with high affinity to G6b-B, an inhibitory receptor found on
megakaryocytes and platelets, involved in the regulation of platelet production. Our studies also show that G4.1
promotes G6b-B dimerization, which is required for downstream signaling. Based on this data, we hypothesize
that, G4.1 promotes thrombopoiesis, in part, by its highly selective interaction with G6b-B. We will determine the
nature of the interaction of G4.1 with G6b-B, probe the selectivity of G4.1 for G6b-B, and elucidate the structure-
activity-relationship (SAR) of this class of compounds. This research proposal benefits from; 1) the candidate’s
personal track-record, 2) robust preliminary data, 3) a highly experienced advisory committee with relevant
expertise to the proposed research, and 4) a supportive and well-resourced research environment. The three
aims of the proposal are : I) Determine the nature of interaction of G4.1 with G6b-B, II) Evaluate the selectivity
of G4.1 recognition of G6b-B, and III) Synthesize a library of G4.1 analogs and elucidate SAR."

Technology will be developed to enable future compact, mid-field (0.7 Tesla) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
systems, for improving human health worldwide. MRI is an indispensable imaging tool that provides 
measurement capabilities unavailable with other modalities. Yet, due to its expense, large size, and demand on 
facility infrastructure, high quality MRI remains inaccessible to a large fraction of the world’s population, 
particularly in remote and resource-limited settings. The existence of portable, affordable, high-performing MRI 
technology will substantially expand its accessibility for both clinical care and neuroimaging research. Although 
low field (<0.1 Tesla) MRI scanners are now commercially available, to date they have not produced images of 
similar quality as those of mid- and high-field MRI scanners unless relying on intensive post-processing based 
on machine-learning and AI, which makes the reliability of these low field images uncertain at this time. As an 
alternative approach for increasing portability, and thus increasing access to mid-field MRI (0.1 - 1 Tesla), in this 
project we will further develop new technology called FREE (Frequency-modulated Rabi-Encoded Echoes) that 
has potential to eliminate one of the most expensive and massive hardware components of an MRI system; 
namely, the pulsed field gradients that are conventionally used to encode spatial information in MRI. Instead, the 
MR signals will be encoded by spatially varying radiofrequency (RF) fields, using specialized multi-channel RF 
coils and a novel frequency-swept pulse technique that performs spatial encoding using RF field gradients, even 
when the magnet produces a highly nonuniform field. Further, this project will build upon the previous innovations 
by this same team in a U01 grant that led to: 1) the capability to perform MRI with extreme magnetic field 
inhomogeneity (~2-3 orders of magnitude greater than what is commonly perceived to be necessary), 2) a unique 
compact high temperature superconducting (HTS) head-only magnet, and 3) a state-of-the-art multi-channel 
digital spectrometer for programming and controlling the MRI scanner. The research in this R56 project will 
involve computer simulations and experimental tests using the HTS head-only MRI scanner operating at 0.7
Tesla. We will develop a multichannel RF coil and multi-echo 2D-FREE imaging with parallel RF transmission 
and reception. Products will include new MRI methods, software, and hardware to achieve highly portable midfield MRI. Future portable mid-field MRI scanners based on this new technology will help people in remote, 
resource-limited settings to address health inequities."
11124415,"As over 25 million people living with HIV (PWH) in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) reach older age, determining their risk for and causes of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s related dementia (ADRD) is emerging as a major public health priority. Although neuropsychological battery data exist, it has been limited to young populations and lacked specialist evaluations, brain imaging and biomarkers to confirm disease phenotypes. Moreover, social and clinical health determinants differ meaningfully in sSA, so risk factors for MCI and its impact on households require further study. This proposal is led by experts in the epidemiology of HIV in sSA, diagnosis and deep-phenotyping of MCI and ADRD with biomarker and brain imaging techniques, and machine learning methods to elucidate mechanisms. Their preliminary data include neuropsychological screening of 300 older PWH in Uganda on ART (mean age >60), and 300 demographically-similar HIV-negative comparators, showing that >30% of PWH have characteristics of MCI and that brain MRI and machine learning techniques add critical phenotyping data to standard batteries. Four specific aims are proposed: Aim 1: Determine the prevalence and classification of MCI and ADRD (1A) and compare trajectories of cognitive decline (1B) between older PWH in Uganda and demographically similar HIV-negative individuals. Comprehensive neuropsychological assessments will be completed among older adults with and without HIV in the Uganda Aging Cohort (n=600) in years 1 and 4, and MCI and ADRD type (ie vascular, Alzheimer’s Disease, HIV-related) will be defined using multi-disciplinary case consensus criteria to provide clinical diagnoses and etiologies. Aim 2: Identify pathophysiologic contributors to MCI and ADRD in older adults in Uganda by performing deep-phenotyping with novel plasma biomarkers and neuroimaging. Assessments will include Aβ42/Aβ40, p-tau217, GFAP, and NfL biomarkers of ADRD and brain MRIs to characterize MCI phenotypes among PWH in Uganda. Aim 3: Estimate the psychosocial and economic impacts of MCI and ADRD on adult household members in Uganda. Adult household members will be surveyed about employment/resource use, caregiving burden, quality of life, stigma, social participation, loneliness, and mental health to compare participants by the presence vs absence of MCI in the household. Aim 4: Discover and validate novel explanatory models of MCI and dementia among older PWH by employing ML methods with the full array of data collected in Aims 1-3. The elements collected in Aims 1-3 will be used to determine the combinations of highly dimensional features that most accurately and reliably classify individuals with MCI and ADRD. Completing these aims will advance our understanding of the epidemiology of MCI and ADRD, their phenotypes, and their societal impacts in Uganda. In doing so, it will lead to diagnostic and intervention approaches to address NIA research priorities."
11124444,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A vaccine is a promising approach for stopping the spread of HIV infections. Although vaccine regimens in clinical
trials show various levels of protection against HIV, there is no effective vaccine available for a large population
yet. Preclinical and clinical data demonstrate the importance of both adjuvants and antigens for an effective HIV
vaccine. Particularly, stimulation of toll-like receptors (TLRs) or stimulator of interferon genes (STING) boosts
the immune response of the HIV antigens in multiple animal models. Meanwhile, HIV immunogens are a critical
factor for both humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity such as broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs)
and cytotoxic T cells. Despite these important advances, significant challenges remain in immunogen design,
immunogen delivery, and adjuvant choice. To overcome these challenges, we propose to integrate adjuvant
derived nanoparticles and engineered mRNA for HIV vaccine discovery. In preliminary studies, we developed
adjuvant derived nanoparticles (ANPs) using TLR or STING agonists, which showed great potential for efficient
mRNA delivery as a vaccine platform. Moreover, we constructed glycosylated HIV immunogens that trigger
mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-mediated innate immune recognition, leading to enhanced antibody responses.
Additionally, we systematically investigated the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs in order to enhance
protein production. Through a comprehensive analysis of endogenous gene expression and de novo design of
UTRs, we identified the optimal combination of 5’ and 3’ UTR for mRNA engineering. Based on these results
and findings, the goal of this proposed project is to develop adjuvant derived nanoparticles as functional
nanomaterials capable of efficiently delivering HIV immunogens in vivo, consequently generating strong and
durable humoral and cell-mediated immunity against HIV. The following specific aims will be carried out to
accomplish our goal: 1) Synthesis and characterization of adjuvant derived nanoparticles (ANPs); 2) Engineering
of mRNA transcripts encoding various HIV immunogens with high translation efficiency; and 3) Determination of
immunogenicity and safety profiles of ANPs-mRNA in mouse and non-human primate models. Encouraged by
results from our preliminary studies, we expect the newly designed nanomaterials from this proposal to establish
a vaccine candidate, which can facilitate clinical translation and a new avenue for HIV vaccine discovery.
Knowledge gained from this study can also be extended to other types of vaccines for emerging pathogens."
11126332,"This proposal outlines the scientific agenda of the Leadership and Operations Center of the HIV Vaccine Trials
Network (HVTN), the collaboration of physician scientists at 64 clinical trial sites in 15 countries on 4 continents
dedicated to developing a globally effective HIV vaccine. During the current funding period, the HVTN has
transformed HIV prevention science by taking two HIV vaccine concepts and the broadly neutralizing monoclonal
antibody (mAb) VRC01 from phase 1 to efficacy evaluation. We have added over 35 clinical trial sites in sub-
Saharan Africa and now have over 12,500 participants enrolled in randomized controlled efficacy trials.
We propose to continue our scientific leadership in HIV vaccines. The scientific pipeline for vaccines with the
potential to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to HIV has markedly expanded. This proposal
describes a novel fast-track phase 1 program to assess, in an iterative fashion, candidate trimers, germline or
lineage-based vaccines designed to elicit bnAbs in adults. A phase 1 program to investigate these vaccines in
HIV-1–exposed infants is also proposed. The HVTN currently has five HIV efficacy trials in place. Two vaccine
trials (HVTN 702 & 705) are in progress; a third (HVTN 706) will start in August 2019; and we are collaborating
with the HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN) on two antibody-mediated prevention (AMP) trials evaluating the
infusion of passively administered mAbs. These efficacy trials will define the potential of neutralizing and/or non-
neutralizing antibodies to prevent HIV acquisition. The samples and statistical design of the efficacy trials are
developed around correlates of protection; we will continue to develop the robust integrated laboratory, statistical
and computational platform needed to define these correlates. We will also continue to expand our behavioral
sciences program to enhance our already successful recruitment and retention programs, and to continue to
expand the enrollment of persons of color and transgender persons into HVTN trials.
Vaccine clinical trials involve a complex interplay between clinical trial sites, HVTN laboratories, computational
scientists, and our operational, training, mentoring, and fiscal management teams; these interactions are
described in the application. The clinical, laboratory and statistical infrastructure we have built for HIV vaccines
will also be used to assist in tuberculosis (TB) vaccine development. Importantly, we will build on our success in
the unique community-based programs and integration of community representatives and community advisory
boards into HVTN research process and conduct. We will also continue to develop the next generation of vaccine
scientists and expand our scientific collaborations to engage the scientific community to utilize the extensive
specimen and data repositories we have established. The overall goal of the HVTN in this proposal is to develop
a vaccine regimen or combination mAb regimen that will reduce HIV acquisition in adults and infants by more
than 60 percent."

11127027,"Project Summary/Abstract
Vaso-occlusive events represent a major clinical burden in sickle cell disease (SCD). Vaso-occlusive events
recur in patients despite current treatments, including the use of hydroxyurea to increase fetal hemoglobin and
crizanlizumab that targets P-selectin for cellular adhesion. Oxidative stress in SCD increases the risk for vaso-
occlusion and current anti-oxidative treatments, including L-glutamine, show efficacy in decreasing these events.
However, antioxidants do not ameliorate vaso-occlusive crises. New treatment strategies for vaso-occlusion in
sickle cell disease based on an improved understanding of the redox mechanisms are required. Thiol isomerases
belong to a class of oxidoreductases that are secreted from platelets and endothelial cells and are required for
thrombus formation. The archetypal thiol isomerase, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), promotes
thromboinflammation in SCD, is sensitive to the redox environment, and can be targeted with flavonoids such
as isoquercetin. Our preliminary data that isoquercetin decreases cell-cell adhesion in SCD mice suggests that
PDI could be a potential target for vaso-occlusion. However, the mechanism by which PDI promotes vaso-
occlusion is unclear. This proposal will test the central hypothesis that thiol isomerases promote redox-sensitive
vaso-occlusion through cysteine electron transferring events in sickle cell disease. We will evaluate redox stress-
mediated vaso-occlusion in SCD in three integrated aims using cell and chemical biology approaches with
murine models of the disease. In Aim 1, we will mechanistically examine the capacity of PDI to sense the redox
environment in SCD to promote electron transfers in the form of cysteine disulfides. This aim will determine
whether reduced or oxidized PDI promotes platelet and neutrophil activation in SCD by catalyzing electron
withdrawal from their known redox targets. In Aim 2, we will transition our studies to evaluate the function of
electron withdrawal mechanisms catalyze by thiol isomerases using intravital microscopy to observe thrombosis,
hemostasis, and vaso-occlusion in SCD. We will also complement the studies by observing the function of thiol
isomerase-mediated electron withdrawal on leukocyte cell-cell adhesion events in vivo. Lastly, Aim 3 will utilize
carbon nucleophilic probes that tag specific cysteine sulfur oxoforms to probe the global function of electron
transferring events in SCD. The probes will identify new targets of thiol isomerases in an unbiased manner in
order to determine whether a characteristic set of cysteine disulfide scission or formation is required for vaso -
occlusion. The probes will also identify mechanistically the role of cysteine electron transferring events on
hemoglobin function for red blood cell sickling and leukocyte-mediated cell-cell adhesion for vaso-occlusive
events. The K99 phase will focus on Aims 1 and 2 whereas the R00 phase will focus on Aim 3. The additional
training afforded by this career development award will not only enable me to expand my skillsets, but will also
uniquely position me to build an independent research program focused on oxidative cysteine modification in the
redox-regulated vaso-occlusive events of SCD."

11125021,"Summary:
Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a β-herpes virus with high seroprevalence rates of 60-90% within the
population that can spread through bodily fluids, organ transplants, and from mother to fetus via the placenta.
Virus proliferation significantly increases the morbidity and mortality of immunocompromised individuals, such
as newborns, organ transplant recipients, AIDS patients, and the elderly. Approximately 30,000 solid organ
transplant and 23,000 bone marrow transplants operations are performed in the U.S. every year. CMV is the
leading cause of birth defects, affecting ~1% of newborns giving rise to ~30,000 new cases of CMV infection
reported annually in the US. While several drugs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of CMV
infections, including ganciclovir, foscarnet, letermovir, and recently maribavir, these compounds were found to
exhibit high frequencies of drug resistance and severe side effects, including bone marrow toxicity,
gastrointestinal disruption, and nephrotoxicity. Given the large number of patient populations at risk for CMV-
associated diseases and the estimated cost to treat CMV in the US ($4.4 billion/year by the National Academy
of Sciences), novel therapeutic strategies to treat CMV-associated diseases is needed. The development of
novel therapeutics that target different steps of the viral life cycle to limit virus propagation and dissemination
would provide therapeutic for treating CMV-related diseases. We developed a high-content screening assay
using a CMV AD169 reporter virus to screen >112,000 compounds in collaboration with Microbiotix to identify
inhibitors that block the early stage of infection. One compound, MBXC-4302, is a N-arylpyrimidinamine
(NAPA) that exhibited potent anti-CMV infection activity (IC50 ~3 µM), limited cytotoxicity (CC50 >100µM),
favorable in vitro ADME properties, and a responsive structure activity relationship (SAR). Commercial analogs
of MBXC-4302 identified MBXC-4992 with an improved selective index. Our general hypothesis is that the
NAPA compounds represent novel CMV entry inhibitors that can be developed into effective CMV
therapeutics. To evaluate our hypothesis, we plan to complete the following Aims: 1) Characterize the
mechanism of action and broad inhibition of the NAPA compounds; 2) Optimize the NAPA series through SAR-
driven analog generation; 3) Evaluate the ability of NAPA compounds to limit virus proliferation and
dissemination in diverse in vitro models; and 4) Evaluate pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and efficacy of
prioritized NAPA analogs in dissemination studies in vivo. We plan to develop several NAPA analogs as
effective CMV therapeutics that inhibit CMV dissemination as a single agent or in combination with FDA
approved CMV drugs."
11125022,"ABSTRACT
 Mosquitoes use their olfactory and gustatory systems to find and land on a human host’s skin for a blood
meal, and in the process transmit diseases like Dengue to hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Therefore,
the two chemosensory systems are excellent targets for behavior disruption strategies. The gustatory system, in
particular, plays the most critical role in avoidance of the synthetic topical insect repellent DEET, however it has
not been leveraged for discovery of improved repellents. There is a huge need for better topical repellents; the
poor cosmetic properties and high cost for frequent application on the skin preclude the use of DEET by high-
risk populations in tropical countries. We reasoned that new behavioral actives could be identified from human
skin-associated compounds, the rationale being that anthropophilic mosquitoes, such as Aedes aegypti, exhibit
different preferences for individual humans based on differences in skin chemistry. In a recent breakthrough we
developed a Machine Learning cheminformatic method to predict odorant and tastant repellents from in silico
screening of skin-associated compounds. In preliminary testing using behavior assays, we found powerful
repellent effects from components of skin volatiles, sweat and even microbiome metabolites. The overarching
goal of this proposal is to identify skin compounds that affect close-range mosquito landing behavior and perform
an analysis of the cellular and receptor pathways (Or, Ir, Gr or TrpA1) that are required to sense these
compounds in olfactory and gustatory neurons of Ae. aegypti. The objective will be achieved via three specific
aims. First, we will validate the computationally-predicted skin repellents in mosquito behavioral assays designed
to evaluate close-range (olfactory) and contact-dependent (gustatory) effects, which will create priority lists for
the following aims. Second, compounds that act upon contact or are non-volatile will be prioritized for surveying
gustatory responses with single sensillum electrophysiology and in assays to examine residency and probing
behaviors, which occur after landing in preparation for blood feeding. Testing Gr and Ir co-receptor mutants will
identify chemoreceptor pathways involved in sensing any taste-active repellents. Third, compounds that are low-
volatility and act at close range (like DEET) will be prioritized for surveying olfactory responses with
electrophysiology. Contributions of chemoreceptor pathways involved in sensing the olfaction-active repellents
will be identified by testing Orco and Ir co-receptor mutants. Finally, we will test if blends of predicted skin
repellents that act on both olfactory and gustatory pathways can alter host attractiveness. Successful completion
of this proposal will provide a foundation for understanding how aversive components of complex skin-associated
cues can alter mosquito-host interactions at close range."
11125029,"There is an urgent need for a better understanding of the propagation of encephalitogenic autoimmune
responses and the identification of relevant immune cells and their specific characteristics, which could serve as
biomarkers and therapeutical targets. CD4+ T cells show critical pathogenic roles in multiple sclerosis (MS) in
preclinical models and human disease. Within the central nervous system (CNS), the encephalitogenic
autoimmune CD4+ T cells infiltrate the MS brain lesions, and these T cells recirculate to the peripheral immune
system, where they can be maintained and activated. The mechanisms that support long-term maintenance of
the pro-encephalitogenic autoimmune CD4+ T cells remain a mystery. The long-lived stem-like CD4+ T cells
(CD4+ TSTEMS) with enhanced capacities for effector differentiation were proposed to contribute to the onset and
exacerbation of MS disease in humans and in the corresponding animal models. Unlike the well-characterized
CD8+ TSTEMS involved in anti-tumor and anti-viral immune responses, these MS-related autoimmune CD4+ TSTEMS
are still understudied. Moreover, the current markers of CD4+ TSTEMS are contextual, e.g., T cell factor 1 (Tcf1,
encoded by Tcf7) is expressed in non-stem cells, including naive T cells. A lack of precision analytical tools and
clearly defined markers hinders further progress in understanding the stem-like paradigm. Our published results
uncovered that pro-encephalitogenic CD4+ pre-effectors de novo induced from naive T cells become
programmed for diverse autoimmune TEFFS differentiation in an MS model, lending support to the stem-like
paradigm. We developed a strategy to overcome the lack of biomarkers issue by identifying a consensus
signature from the transcriptomes of various bona fide stem cells. We used this consensus signature and
identified a conserved stemness transcriptomic profile specifically in mouse pre-effectors and human T cells from
the peripheral blood of MS patients but not in MS-free controls. Furthermore, we have developed a new single-
cell sequencing analytical approach enabled by an advanced scoring method, which retrieves biologically
relevant information based on the cumulative expression of multiple genes involved in specific biological
processes. We extend these exciting research endeavors in this proposal and dedicate Aims 1 and 2 to rigorously
test the hypothesis that a continuing stemness and encephalitogenic TEFFS differentiation results in a functional
and transcriptomic diversification of CD4+ TSTEM lineages under evolving autoimmune conditions. Furthermore,
we have also found increased expression of the homeodomain-only protein (Hopx), in pro-encephalitogenic pre-
effectors. Mouse Hopx and human HOPX are well-established orchestrators of stemness in progenitor
populations. Intriguingly, we found that Hopx also critically enhanced the survival of Foxp3+ TREGS, suppressing
disease in MS models. Therefore, in Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that Hopx orchestrates independent
mechanisms in pro-encephalitogenic TSTEMS and anti-encephalitogenic TREGS, resulting in functionally opposing
outcomes impacting the autoimmune response."
11125032,"Project Summary/Abstract
“Necroptosis” is a form of cell death with roles in host defense, autoimmunity, and cancer. Necroptosis is
associated with inflammation and immunity, but how cells in which the necroptotic pathway is active alter the
immune response is poorly understood. Much of the prior research in this area has focused on the role of lytic
cell death and the release of “DAMP” molecules in necroptosis-induced inflammation. However, recent work
from our group and others has highlighted key roles for proteins of the necroptotic pathway—including RIPK1
and TRIF—in activating inflammatory transcription programs, and has demonstrated that activation of
“necroptosis” can drive cytokine production in the absence of cell death in some settings. The work proposed
here will test the hypothesis that transcriptional signaling, not lytic cell death, represents the most
immunologically significant output of the “necroptotic” pathway, and that necroptotic cell death may actually
reduce inflammation by eliminating cells in which inflammatory transcription programs are active. To do this,
we will focus on thee Aims: First, we will define the interactions and transcription programs activated by
necroptotic pathway components in cultured cells, using engineered proteins and natural ligands. Second, we
will study the role of necroptosis pathway activation in vivo, by delivering engineered, constitutively active
forms of necroptosis inducers to the lung epithelium of mice. Third, we will evaluate the roles of necroptotic
transcription and cell death in the immune response to influenza A virus, a potent activator of the necroptotic
pathway. The work proposed here will use novel experimental tools to understand the immune response to
“necroptosis” in vivo. Given the emerging roles of this pathway in infection, autoimmunity and cancer, and the
substantial efforts underway to target it therapeutically, we suggest that these studies are timely and potentially

Regulation of immune responses in the lung is a critical determinant of health. While the immune system must
respond to viral and bacterial pathogens, these responses must be finely tuned so as not to reduce organ
function. Aberrant immune responses to viral pathogens in the lung can result in significant morbidity and
mortality.
Control of maladaptive host immune responses occurs through a number of mechanisms including input from
the nervous system. Reciprocal communication between these two systems throughout the body has emerged
as a mechanism to detect pathogens and coordinate host-protective immune responses and control
inflammation. Although neuro-immune circuits in the lung are known to exist, the contribution of these to the
regulation of inflammation caused by virus-derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns is unknown.
Building on our preliminary data showing the regulation of lung inflammation by a unique neuro-immune circuit,
the overall goals of this project are to precisely determine the role of vagal afferent neurons, the neuro-immune
circuitry, signaling used, and how immune cell function is regulated.
By using complementary and unique tools, the role of vagal afferent neurons and the processes these neurons
evoke to suppress lung inflammation will be determined. To achieve this, we will use selective activation of
vagal afferent neurons, perform identification of lung-specific vagal afferents, and confirm the role of β2AR and
the source of catecholamines that regulate acute lung inflammation induced by a TLR agonist. Finally, we will
assess if this novel anti-inflammatory pathway can be evoked to control inflammation during influenza infection
(SA1). Understanding of the endogenous reflex triggered by lung inflammation will be performed using a
combination of optogenetic silencing of the vagal afferents, pharmacological antagonists, and novel mice with
conditional TLR7 deficiency in vagal afferents, to deduce if neurons sense viral components, and the
mechanisms of immune regulation elicited. Finally, the role of sympathetic lung innervation will be assessed,
and the requirement for specific neurotransmitter receptors tested (SA2). Together, these proposed studies will
decipher the contribution and components of a novel lung anti-inflammatory pathway that limits acute lung
inflammation."

AHRQ previously funded the development of Elder Tree (ET), a laptop-based eHealth system shown in a
randomized trial to improve quality of life and health factors among older adults with multiple chronic conditions
(MCCs) such as diabetes and hypertension. MCCs are pervasive and costly among older adults, reducing
quality of life and accounting for 90% of Medicare spending. Self-management can help patients control their
conditions, but these skills are rarely taught in primary care. ET provides tools and support for such self-
management and addresses the frustration, discouragement, and loneliness shared by all patients with MCCs,
regardless of specific disease. Despite positive results, though, many study participants did not use ET
extensively, a problem for all health apps. In a separate survey, we learned that more than 60% of non-users
abandoned ET because the computer was too hard to use. Voice-controlled ""smart"" technology may solve this
problem. Smart speakers, used by speaking and listening rather than typing and reading, avoid barriers to use
such as poor vision, tremors, and interface complexity; they have been adopted at a rate faster than the
Internet or TV, especially among older adults. Smart displays enhance the system with a visual element,
helping users remember content and creating access to media meant to be viewed.
This application proposes to test the ability of voice-activated technology to expand the implementation and
sustain the use of a proven electronic health system. Specifically, we propose to test whether older adults with
MCCs will use and benefit more from ET delivered by a smart system (speaker plus display), due to ease of
use, than from a laptop version of ET. The proposal has 2 aims: 1) develop the smart system platform (ET-SS)
and 2) test it against laptop ET (ET-LT) in a 2-arm RCT. The trial will randomize 220 patients age 65+ with 4 or
more chronic conditions to receive for 8 months either ET-LT or ET-SS. We hypothesize that:
 · patients with ET-SS (vs. ET-LT) will have greater ET use and better quality of life in month 8.
 · these clinical outcomes will improve: a) 30-day hospital readmissions), b) medication adherence, and c)
 composite score of HbA1c, mg/dL, mmHg, FEV-1, BMI, PHQ-8, FAS-GFR, and Brief Pain Inventory.
 · the amount of ET use at 4 months will mediate the effects of ET at 8 months (i.e. greater use at 4
 months=greater effects at 8 months), and negative affect and Self-Determination Theory constructs of
 competence, social relatedness, and intrinsic motivation will mediate the effects of ET use.
 · ET-SS will have better outcomes for women and for patients with 6+ (vs. 4-5) chronic conditions.
We, the investigators who developed ET, have conducted numerous RCTs of eHealth systems and published
extensively. To our knowledge, this will be the first large RCT of a smart system as a platform to implement
and disseminate a health intervention. The result could make ET more accessible and effective for older
patients, improve their quality of life, and point the way to more impactful delivery of future eHealth innovations."

The parent project, UZIMA-DS (UtiliZing Health Information for Meaningful Impact in East Africa through Data
Science), aims to create a scalable and sustainable platform to apply novel approaches to data assimilation
and advanced artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML)-based methods to improve health outcomes in
two health domains: maternal, newborn and child health; and mental health. Over the past few years, the Aga
Khan University (AKU) in East Africa has been leading the administration of several NIH grants in collaboration
with the University of Michigan (U-M), including the UZIMA-DS Research Hub. While AKU has successfully
established a global research administration office with critical components - a core dedicated team, a cloud-
based grants management system, and best practice processes - critical advances in optimization related to
training and operation are needed. Building on the institutional partnership with U-M, the overall objective of
this administrative supplement is to develop a more comprehensive and efficient research administration
function at AKU to support the development, submission, and successful administration of research grants. We
aim to foster international collaborations and bi-directional learning opportunities with our U-M partners and
explore ways to disseminate our work to other DS-I Africa partners and the broader community of researchers
through the following specific aims: Aim 1. To enhance the research administration function through training
and operational efficiency. We will create a tailored toolkit based on a needs assessment and site visits that
includes a hybrid curriculum (virtual and in-person trainings) to upskill current and future research
administration staff; standardized roles and responsibilities, flowcharts, and processes for a grant life cycle;
and established metrics to estimate current and future staffing needs. Aim 2. To develop a mentorship and
continuous learning network for research administrators. We will develop a community of practice between
AKU and U-M to serve as the cornerstone of broader engagement of the research administration community.
This established community can also leverage the DS-I network to facilitate organic engagement between
interested partners beyond the duration of this project. We will work with the DS-I Coordinating Center and
Research Administrators Working Group to disseminate developed materials and training modules to the
broader DS-I Africa community. The proposed work can serve as a framework for standard research
administration services that can be scaled/adapted to the needs of our DS-I Africa members. In addition, the
lessons learned over the next year through this project and the DS-I Africa Research Administrators Working
Group will help the DS-I Coordinating Center address critical joint administrative needs of the consortium and
enhance research administration functions. By leveraging the DS-I network, these synergistic activities can
build a more robust research administration network as projects plan for the next phase of DS-I Africa funding
and empower other African and global partners who face similar challenges regarding research administration."

The number of people impacted by Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (ADRD)
is 5 million in the US alone and is expected to grow, especially in Black communities. Black older adults have a
40-80% higher incidence of ADRD and approximately double the risk of underdiagnosis. Innovative use of
survey-Medicare Claims linked data holds promise to advance our understanding of disparities in timely ADRD
diagnosis and their contributing factors. However, no prior research has validated this approach. Also, prior
research on risk factors for delayed ADRD diagnosis has focused on individual-level characteristics that are
difficult to modify. I seek to fill this gap by validating the measure of timeliness of ADRD diagnosis with respect
to the survival benefits and examining placed-based structural factors associated with disparities in timely
ADRD diagnosis. Residential racial segregation and geographic features of health care access are important to
consider together. While unequal distribution of health care resources in segregated areas may be the primary
driver of the racial disparities in timely diagnosis, residential segregation may capture unobserved features of
structural racism influencing health care utilization patterns by race. These factors can be mutually reinforcing
drivers of poor diagnosis in the Black population. In the K99 phase, I will conduct a robust epidemiological
analysis to examine the timeliness of ADRD diagnosis related to survival using the Health and Retirement
Study and the National Health and Aging Trends Study. In the R00 phase, I will examine the association
between residential racial segregation or health care access features and racial disparities in the timeliness of
ADRD diagnosis while extending my inquiry to the cohort from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial
Disparities in Stroke study. I will also examine how the magnitude of the association between health service
characteristics and timely ADRD diagnosis differs by small-area characteristics (e.g., area deprivation) and
individual characteristics (e.g., education). This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on
my background in social work and sociology, and includes new training in (1) neurodegenerative diseases,
clinical assessment, and diagnostic pathways; (2) application of algorithm-based dementia assessment in
surveys; (3) utilization of Medicare claims data, and (4) gaining additional sociological knowledge in linking
data in residential segregation, health care access, and racial disparities related to timely ADRD diagnosis.
The combined research and training plans will prepare me for a successful independent research career
focused on identifying modifiable determinants of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias, and study of the
effects of policies and interventions to reduce racial disparities in ADRD. Together, these have the potential to
improve prevention and care in ADRD. My mentorship team is uniquely poised to assist me in achieving my
training and research goals and ensure my successful transition to independent investigator status."

Lipids are synthesized and modified primarily by integral membrane enzymes embedded, at least in part, in the
bilayer itself. These enzymatic reactions are essential not only for the biosynthesis of all cellular membranes,
but also for lipid-mediated signaling and for the export of soluble molecules as lipid conjugates to outer cellular
compartments for a wide array of basic cellular functions, which include protein and lipid glycosylation, and
modifications of the chemical properties of outer membranes. However, despite the advances in our
understanding of how membrane proteins function, our knowledge of how membrane enzymes interact with their
lipidic substrates at atomic level remains scarce, also hindered by the hydrophobicity of the ligands themselves.
The main focus of my lab is to use structural biology – mainly single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)
– to investigate at a molecular level the interactions between membrane enzymes and their lipidic substrates. In
a structural biology-centered integrated approach, our structures, combined with computational experiments, will
produce testable functional hypotheses. We are interested in understanding how hydrophobic and hydrophilic
substrates are brought into apposition for catalysis to occur, on how chemical reactions involving charged groups
and an aqueous environment can adapt to process lipophilic molecules, on what are the molecular determinants
of substrate specificity for hydrophobic ligands, and on the role that the membrane itself plays in these processes.
We expect common principles on the interactions between, membrane, membrane enzymes, and lipidic
substrates to emerge from our studies.
We will focus our attention on the subclass of membrane glycosyltransferases that utilize polyprenyl- mono- and
di-phosphate sugar conjugates as substrates. These enzymes play a role in a wide array of biological functions
including providing the sugars needed for protein glycosylation, modification of the lipopolysaccharide
component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria in response to antibiotics, biosynthesis of the
bacterial peptidoglycan layer, and assembly of the mycobacterial cell well. We will work on individual enzymes
deciphering their molecular mechanism across their entire catalytic cycle, as well as understanding how these
might function as part of larger macromolecular assemblies, in a physiological context.
To succeed, we will combine our expertise in membrane protein production, biochemistry, and structural biology,
to that of our collaborators that are leaders in their respective fields. These range from computational biology, to
chemical synthesis of sugar-lipid conjugates, to biochemical analysis of LPS, to functional analyses of membrane
proteins in reconstituted systems, to the generation of tools to allow cryo-EM analysis of small proteins and time
resolved cryo-EM, to native mass spectrometry, to genetic modification of bacterial strains, to in cell cross-linking
and proteomics."

HIV/AIDS is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children and adolescents, and it is well recognized
that HIV care and treatment among children (birth to 9 years) and young adolescents (10-14 years) lags behind
that of adults, leading to numerous calls to action. Despite a global consensus toward eliminating new HIV
infections in these age groups, assessing progress against targets is impeded, as current estimates do not
include substantial amounts of locally-available data. Additionally, new HIV infections in young adolescents have
not been quantified. The global HIV burden in these age groups is currently estimated by two groups: the Global
Burden of Disease (GBD) study and UNAIDS, both of which currently assume no new HIV infections for those
under 15. Both groups use the Spectrum child model, which relies largely on estimated HIV prevalence among
adult women, treatment for prevention of mother-to-child transmission, and other assumptions to estimate the
HIV burden among children and young adolescents. One of the assumptions is that new HIV infections among
those under 15 come from only one source – mother-to-child transmission – assuming no sexual activity and
zero HIV incidence in young adolescents. In addition to behavioral factors, evidence shows that the risk of HIV
transmission is influenced by biomedical factors (e.g., HIV testing rates, antiretroviral therapy coverage) and
structural factors (e.g., national wealth, access to education, health care quality and access). However, there
has been no systematic study of the impact of these factors on the trajectory of the HIV epidemic. Given the
complexity of the epidemic and the interplay of contributing factors, additional data and analyses are needed to
understand the relative impact of these factors. Developing methods to triangulate newly acquired data sources
is crucial to enhancing understanding of the drivers of the epidemic, and to generating more robust HIV burden
estimates for children and adolescents. Accordingly, the goal of this study is to address the limitations of existing
methods by triangulating empirical data sources to produce more accurate and comprehensive estimates of
pediatric HIV burden, including an understanding of how biomedical, behavioral, and structural factors impact
the burden among children and adolescents. Our proposal advances beyond existing work by providing the first-
ever estimates of new HIV infections among young adolescents, and by incorporating these results into an
interactive visualization platform to help key stakeholders understand the current and projected future burden of
HIV/AIDS among children and adolescents under different scenarios. This project is comprised of four Specific
Aims: (1) Incorporate currently unused data sources to estimate mother-to-child transmission and HIV burden
among children (0-9 years); (2) Estimate new infections among young adolescents (10-14 years); (3) Quantify
the impact of biomedical, behavioral, and structural factors on HIV transmission probabilities and mortality among
children and young adolescents; and (4) Forecast future burden of HIV among children and adolescents through
2040 based on current trends in incidence, prevalence, and mortality, and exposure to risk and protective factors."

10771220,"Recent studies reveal that immunosuppressive regions vary substantially throughout glioblastoma (GBM) tumors. These immune-restricted niches appear to correspond to specific extracellular matrix (ECM) components that are thought to drive regional mesenchymal transition. We hypothesize that these distinct GBM mesenchymal regions both coincide with, and are responsible for, monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell (M-MDSC) infiltration. Our project hypothesis predicts that changes in regional hyaluronic acid (HA) extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness induces the activation of proneural GBM cell surface CD44 that, in turn, drives simultaneous mesenchymal transition and increases an M-MDSC recruiting/differentiation transcriptional program.

CIBBR investigators and its evaluation model; (2) help recruit and support early-stage and senior-level tenure- 
track faculty as a cluster hire that is thematically focused on quantitative/computational biology and multi- 
omics; (3) enhance our multi-faceted Mentoring Program; and (4) strengthen the CIBBR ecosystem by 
expansion of its Research Cores and by outreach activities to other regional IDeA programs. We will attain 
these Administrative Core objectives by (1) enhancing the administrative operations of CIBBR and its 
programs, in part through the recruitment of two senior-level biomedical and bioengineering researchers; (2) 
recruiting new early-stage investigators supported by the CIBBR Mentoring Program, thereby attaining a 
critical mass of successful biomedical and bioengineering researchers; and (3) growing the CIBBR ecosystem 
through expansion of its Research Cores and coordination of outreach activities with regional IDeA programs 
and external partners. 
 Upon completion of these aims, CIBBR will have heightened its impact on the biomedical and 
bioengineering research environment at UNH by increasing the number of faculty at UNH conducting NIH- 
funded research, advancing the career development of early-stage faculty, and facilitating the pathway from 
basic biomedical research to clinical/translational research and commercialization in order to expedite the 
development of treatments for human diseases."

Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) is a leading cause of diarrhea, that continues to be associated with significant
morbidity, mortality and stunting, among children <5 years of age living in low and middle income countries
(LMIC). Although many ETEC vaccines are in clinical trials, none are currently licensed. To avoid further
morbidity and mortality due to ETEC, an efficacious vaccine given effectively is urgently required.
While the logical target group for ETEC vaccine would be infants, children in LMICs have been difficult to
effectively immunize with other oral vaccines. To address this critical problem of low oral vaccine immune
responses among infants in LMICs, an alternative strategy for protecting infants against ETEC needs to be
explored. We hypothesize that maternal immunity may contribute to protecting infants from ETEC. However, the
protective benefits and the components of maternal immunity associated with protection in infants from enteric
infections like ETEC has not been widely studied. Therefore, if this route of passive immunity is feasible for ETEC
is uncertain.
Our aim is to study natural infections of ETEC in the mothers and babies to determine if the maternal antibodies
to ETEC could prevent ETEC infections in children. We will also identify the ETEC antigens that are immunogenic
and whose humoral immunity is transferable and protective to the neonates. Our specific hypothesis is that the
antibodies to ETEC heat labile toxins, colonization factors and specific novel antigens transferred through breast
milk would protect the infants from ETEC diarrhea and asymptomatic infections. ETEC-antibodies in the cord
blood may also contribute to this protection. This passive protection may be enhanced by the bioactive factors
like cytokines in the breastmilk and cord blood. To address our aims, we will enroll pregnant mothers and
newborn dyads and follow them for two years of the child's age in Lima, Peru.
This study will uncover the possibility of a more effective immunization approach for protecting infants from ETEC
infections in the first year of life and beyond."

Bacterial pathogens encounter a multitude of chemical and biological insults during infection, including attack by
host immune cells. These stimuli shape the evolution of the pathogen and prompt the development of response
systems to swiftly counter these hostile environments. Two-component systems (TCSs) are the predominant
sensory system for perceiving these stimuli and mediating transcriptional responses to adjust metabolism and
virulence factor production to evade or subvert the host response. Not surprisingly, there is a great deal of interest
in understanding mechanistically how these TCSs function, and how they regulate their gene targets. The PI’s
laboratory studies intersections of metabolism and pathogenesis, with an interest in gene regulation. Several
years ago, the PI’s laboratory discovered that the global regulatory protein CodY regulates the production of
many of the virulence factors of Staphylococcus aureus indirectly through what is arguably one of the most
important virulence regulators in S. aureus – the SaeRS TCS. The SaeRS system has emerged as one of the
most heavily studied TCSs in S. aureus, mainly due to the non-canonical architecture of its membrane sensor
kinase. In recent years, the PI’s group has reported that the effect of CodY on SaeRS function is multifaceted.
CodY acts as a transcriptional repressor to prevent SaeRS activity from becoming unlimited. It also acts post-
transcriptionally to upregulate SaeRS activity. Both functions occur when key amino acids are limiting, reducing
CodY’s regulatory activity. The PI’s laboratory studies the nutritional regulation of pathogenesis in S. aureus.
The long-term goal of the work supported by R01-AI137403 is to understand how metabolism fuels infection,
and how metabolism and virulence are intertwined. The PI’s group will continue probe the mechanisms of SaeRS
control using comprehensive genetic, molecular biological, biochemical and system-wide approaches. Herein,
they propose to 1.) gain insights into the mechanism of SaeRS regulation by branched-chain fatty acids, 2.) to
define the pathways used to synthesize these fatty acids that are an essential component of staphylococcal
membranes, and 3.) to gain a better understanding of how branched-chain fatty acids are integrated into the
overall virulence regulatory network of S. aureus during skin and soft tissue infections. In doing so, the PI’s group
will provide the framework for potentially novel anti-virulence strategies."

Genetic studies of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related-diseases (ADRD) have identified over 72 loci
associated with susceptibility. Although some of the most penetrant variants have been studied independently,
the majority of sequence variants and features are unlikely to act in isolation. In addition, the range of
susceptibility loci cover coding, epigenetic, and regulatory regions of the genome, suggesting complex
relationships that cannot be captured by large-scale transcriptomic and proteomic profiling alone. With
this in mind, we systematically interrogate combinations of variants across validated AD loci in a cell
autonomous and non-autonomous manner using a combination of molecular, epigenetic, and functional
assays. This allows to create a functional network across AD loci, and identify nodal points where the effects
of individual loci interact to trigger the hallmarks of AD pathology and clinical phenotypes. As part of this effort,
we propose to establish a novel AD Locus Annotator interface that synthesizes information about AD-
associated sequence features from reference databases encompassing existing multi-omic and clinical
data, as well as new data sets that capture quantitative proteoform and cellular functional data; these latter two
data modalities have been under-characterized in AD research to date, but are crucial to identifying cross-loci
interactions. From this synthesized data analysis and portal effort, we then establish a set of gene editing
efforts to validate and extend our mechanistic understanding of multilocus functional networks from these
AD-associated sequence features. Taken together, these analyses and experiments allow us to link the
heterogeneity of AD-associated genetic variation and clinical manifestations into a coherent framework that
link AD loci with the temporal sequence of events in AD onset and progression."

The prevalence of Down syndrome (DS) or trisomy 21, the most common chromosomal abnormality
associated with intellectual disability (ID) has increased from ~50,000 in 1950 to ~250,000 in 2017. Most adults
with DS will develop pathology associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) beginning at ~ 30 years of age. By
age 65, the cumulative incidence of dementia exceeds 90% and is the leading cause of death in individuals
with DS. High prevalence of obesity (~81%) and the accompanying chronic oxidative stress may be associated
with increased risk for AD in adults with DS. The available data from trials in typically developed adults
suggests the potential for weight loss achieved through a reduced energy diet and/or consuming a low
glycemic load, low saturated fat, high fruit and vegetable (F/V) diet to prevent or delay the development of AD.
However, the potential of dietary interventions to prevent or delay AD in adults with DS has not been previously
examined. Our group has developed a multi-component intervention which includes a reduced energy
enhanced Stop Light Diet (eSLD), individual behavioral counseling/education, and daily self-monitoring that
has been shown to achieve clinically relevant weight loss (≥ 5%) and improved diet quality in adults with ID.
The eSLD includes daily consumption of 2 portion-controlled entrées (~200 kcal each), 2 low-calorie/high
protein shakes (~100 kcal each), a minimum of 5 servings of F/V, and ad-libitum non-caloric beverages.
Participants are asked to select additional low energy food, if desired, using the SLD system: green (low
energy), yellow (moderate energy), and red (high energy). Results from 2 completed (pilot + DK83539) and 1
on-going trial by our group (DK114121), including 335 adults with ID (78 with DS), have demonstrated
improved diet quality and clinically relevant weight loss at both 6 mos. (-6.2%) and 12 mos. (-6.8%) using our
multi-component intervention with the eSLD. The proposed 2 phase project (clinical readiness and randomized
pilot trial) will evaluate the impact of weight loss and diet intake on factors that may prevent or delay the
development of AD in adults with DS including biomarkers, cognitive function, cerebral antioxidants, and brain
volume. During the clinical readiness phase, we will complete 10 milestones to prepare for successful
administration of the RCT. During the RCT phase, adults with DS and overweight/obesity without dementia
(n=81) will be randomized (2:1) to a 12-month multicomponent weight management intervention using a
reduced energy eSLD + specific recommendations from the Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for
Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet or a health education control. We will calculate effect sizes for changes
in biomarkers related to AD, cerebral antioxidants and brain volume, and cognitive function in both intervention
arms across 12 mos. Additionally, we will assess the independent association of weight loss and changes in
dietary intake with changes biomarkers related to AD, cerebral antioxidants and brain volume, and cognitive
function"

 The long reach of early life remains one of the most enduring puzzles in human health. From famine to
poverty and neglect, adverse early life experiences lead to higher mortality and elevated risk for obesity,
diabetes, and chronic heart disease. These effects are likely mediated, in part, by the stress response, a
cascade of neuroendocrine, metabolic, and cardiac responses to challenge involving the hypothalamic–
pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and the autonomic nervous system. In support, several leading hypotheses
propose that repeated social and environmental stressors—both in early life and adulthood—cause over-
activation of the stress response, chronic stress, and accelerated aging. Long-term studies of natural animal
populations offer compelling models for testing these ideas because they often have fine-grained, prospective,
longitudinal data on social and environmental stressors from individuals across the life course. However,
natural animal models also face considerable challenges in measuring multiple facets of the stress response:
most are constrained to measuring glucocorticoids (GCs) as the sole measure of stress responses, reflecting
just one aspect of the HPA axis with no information on autonomic responses. This limitation has led many to
call for expanded tools to measure stress responses in natural animal models of aging.
 Our objectives in this proposal are to: (1) expand the tools for measuring the cardiometabolic
consequences of stress in natural animal models by validating insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs) with
accelerometry to measure heart rate, heart rate variability, and physical activity; and (2) test the social and
environmental drivers of the autonomic stress response and its metabolic consequences. We will develop and
validate ICMs using captive baboons at the Institute of Primate Research in Kenya, and a well-studied, natural
population of baboons in Amboseli, also in Kenya. Prior work in Amboseli has already shown that an
accumulation of harsh conditions in early life and social isolation in adulthood exert profound effects on adult
mortality, setting the stage to probe the stress responses underlying these links. While early life adversity and
social isolation lead to elevated GCs in adulthood, and animals with high lifelong GCs have lower survival, GCs
do not mediate the link between early adversity and life span. Gaining a broader perspective on individual
stress responses and their consequences is an essential next step. The results will contribute the first
prospective, longitudinal data in any species to understand how early life adversity and adult social conditions
interact to shape acute autonomic stress responses, chronic stress, and energy expenditure. This study will
provide a direct link between socio-environmental circumstances, stress responses, and adult health, helping
to identify key targets to mitigate the effects of stress over the life course on aging."

 Despite excellent short-term outcomes after transplantation, the long-term survival of transplanted organs
has stagnated for several decades. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that acute cellular rejection, which
is mediated by alloreactive T cells, is a risk factor for later graft failure. In order to effectively prevent acute
rejection, deeper understanding of how T cells response to allogeneic antigen are needed. The CD28 pathway
blocker belatacept (a CTLA-4 Ig derivative) offers significant long-term benefits versus calcineurin inhibitors for
kidney transplant patients, but has limited efficacy in restraining CD8+ T cells and acute cellular rejection. Despite
a great body of work investigating the programming of effector CD8+ T cells (TEFF) that respond to infections,
relatively little is known about CD8+ TEFF that respond to allogeneic antigen in the context of an allograft. We
found that after grafting, a subset of CD8+ TEFF expressing the activated CD43 isoform (defined by the 1B11
epitope) are formed during acute effector timepoints from day 7-21 post-graft. CD43 is a cellular receptor that
influences T cell receptor signaling cascades and cellular trafficking, but its role in transplantation is undefined.
Relative to other TEFF subsets, CD43+ TEFF appeared highly activated, displayed vigorous effector functions, and
drove accelerated graft rejection. In human renal transplant patients, CD43+ CD8+ T cells infiltrate the kidney
allografts of patients treated with belatacept, and CD43+ CD8+ T cells are functionally resistant to CTLA-4 Ig in
vitro. Together, these data form the premise for our hypothesis that CD43+ TEFF are a potent effector population
that can be targeted to limit acute rejection following transplantation. In this proposal, we will use an innovative
MHC Class I tetramer to characterize the role of CD43 on graft-specific CD8+ T cells. Specific Aims: First, we
will define the effector mechanisms that distinguish CD43+ TEFF function as a population from CD43- TEFF. Using
adoptive transfer approaches, we will investigate the differentiation pathways that lead from naïve CD8+ T cells
to CD43+ TEFF, the mechanisms by which CD43+ TEFF traffic from the draining lymph nodes into graft tissue, and
the role of the Inducible T Cell Costimulator (ICOS) receptor signaling in the fate of CD43+ TEFF. Second, we will
investigate the role of CD43 receptor signaling on CD8+ T cells. Using a CD43 knockout mouse model, we will
interrogate the requirement of CD43 signaling for graft rejection, how CD43 controls T cell at the clonal level,
and the role of CD43 in determining the quality of secondary memory responses. Third, we will explore the
potential of CD43 as a therapeutic target to limit alloimmunity in humans and mice. We will evaluate whether
targeted deletion of CD43+ TEFF in vivo with an antibody-drug conjugate can elicit tolerance in combination with
CD28 blockade. We will explore whether human CD43+ CD8+ T cells are a significant contributor to alloreactivity
and resistance to CD28 blockade. This proposal will generate deeper understanding of allogeneic TEFF that will
lead to new strategies to restrain CD8+ T cells that mediate acute rejection."
11125017,"Project Summary/Abstract
Plasmodium falciparum is the major global cause of malaria morbidity and mortality and is especially
devastating in pregnant women and children in sub–Saharan Africa. Anopheline mosquitoes are essential for
the spread of new infections, requiring ingestion of mature sexual stages from an infected person and then a
second blood meal once infectious sporozoites are in the mosquito salivary glands. Development of sexual
stages in an infected person’s blood cells requires a complex ~14-day development phase. Even with a lot of
recent progress, many processes essential for sexual stage development remain poorly understood. Our group
has developed a functional genomics approach using random piggyBac mutagenesis, which can be applied at
genome scale to identify the P. falciparum genes essential for gametocyte development. We used this
approach to complete the first saturation mutagenesis screen of P. falciparum to functionally annotate genes
essential and dispensable for asexual blood-stage development. We estimate many genes in the
cryopreserved saturation mutagenesis library are likely to be sexual-stage genes and this mutant library can be
used for a forward phenotypic screen to identify most genes needed for sexual stage development. Advanced
‘omics analyses of selected mutants will be used to validate phenotypes and elucidate the broader cellular
events that underlie the phenotypes during sexual stage development in infected human blood cells. The
project combines expertise in gametocyte biology, advanced computational genomics, and phenotype
comparisons with clinical isolates."
11126420,"Project Summary / Abstract:
This administrative supplement is in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Administrative
Supplements for the Study of the Diverse Aspects of Uterine Serous Carcinoma (Clinical Trial Not Allowed)
Notice Number: NOT-CA-24-044. This supplement is a natural extension of the research supported by the
University of Iowa Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center CCSG grant (P30 CA86862) and addresses the need
for better preclinical models of serous endometrial cancer that represent diverse patient populations. Uterine
endometrial cancer is the 4th most common cancer in females and is unique among cancers in that both incidence
and deaths have increased each year from 2008-2017. Indeed, endometrial cancer is projected to overtake
ovarian cancer as the most deadly gynecologic malignancy this year and surpass colorectal cancer incidence
and deaths in females by 2030. Serous endometrial cancer refers to a specific histologic subtype of endometrial
cancer and is typified by mutations in the tumor suppressor TP53. While cases of serous histology represent the
minority of all endometrial cancer cases (~10%), it is very deadly, with a 37% 5-year survival rate. Endometrial
cancer is a disease of racial, ethnic and geographic disparity, with a lower 5-year survival for Black vs. White
females regardless of stage at diagnosis. For reasons that we do not understand, Black patients have a much
higher rate of diagnosis with serous endometrial cancer and worse outcomes, even when stratified by treatment
and socioeconomic factors. To address the disparities in outcomes for endometrial cancer, we urgently need
better preclinical models that reflect the diversity of the endometrial cancer patient population. Of the available
serous-like endometrial cancer cell lines, most are generated from Asian or White patients. Our group has
amassed a living biobank of over 150 endometrial cancer PDOs that span the various histologic and molecular
subtypes of endometrial cancer. In this supplement, our objective is to build upon our existing capabilities to
expand representation of diverse patient populations in the endometrial cancer PDO biobank, with a special
emphasis on Black patients. Our goal is to create 20 PDO models. Serous endometrial tumors and paired
peripheral blood samples will be collected from patients from underrepresented minority groups (with a focus on
Black patients) undergoing cytoreductive surgery for suspected diagnosis of endometrial cancer. PDOs will be
created with patient tumors. We will validate models for similarity to the primary tumor and compare sensitivity
in vitro with clinical response. We will also partner with community groups to host education sessions about de-
identified specimen use, efforts to maintain patient privacy and research integrity, and what will be achieved by
studying their tumors. This project is anticipated to have a positive impact on serous endometrial cancer by
significantly expanding preclinical models from diverse patient populations. These models and corresponding
sequencing and therapeutic response data will be made available to the academic research community."
11126422,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Significant advances in global health have been achieved in recent decades. Yet, serious disparities in health
outcomes persist, especially among children, adolescents and their adult caregivers. Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
is one of the regions disproportionately burdened by multiple health threats, including endemic CDs; emerging
and re-emerging infectious diseases; increasing incidence of NCDs, and a set of exacerbating factors that have
contributed to poor public health and increased overall disease burden affecting children, adolescents and their
adult caregivers. Similar trends are documented in several other LMICs, including countries in Asia and Eastern
Europe. In light of widespread health inequities and gaps in the translation and uptake of scientific evidence in
real-world settings in LMICs, dissemination and implementation (D&I) science can advance timely and context-
specific public health solutions. Moreover, significant methodological advances in data science can create new
opportunities to more accurately identify at-risk populations, better understand patterns and mechanisms of
health burdens, and allow for more in-depth analysis of implementation gaps and disparities in healthcare
systems and across populations in LMICs. The proposed research training program, entitled “Addressing the
Research Capacity Gap in Global Child, Adolescent & Family Health Disparities Utilizing Implementation
and Data Sciences among Vulnerable Populations in Resource-limited Settings (ACHIEVE)”, focuses on
increasing D&I and data science capacity to address global health disparities affecting children, adolescents and
their adult caregivers. The program addresses the following specific aims: Aim 1: To provide a research training
program to five cohorts (~50 trainees) of health care professionals and post-doctoral trainees from the U.S., and
post-professional degree graduates from SSA that equips trainees with D&I and data science research skills and
knowledge through experiential learning, mentoring, “hands-on” immersion in global health implementation and
data science research and methodologies, individualized consultation, goal setting and monitoring and web-
based support across time; Aim 2: Bring together an interprofessional network of committed mentors from the
global north and the global south to promote equitable bi-directional learning and collaboration and ensure quality
training for promising new investigators committed to applying D&I and data science research methods to
address health disparities impacting children, adolescents, and their families in low-resource settings; Aim 3: To
examine the short-term and longitudinal outcomes of the ACHIEVE training program; and Aim 4. Delineate key
factors that underlie successful mentorship and training of new investigators– with potential implications for new
investigators who are focused on D&I and data science research that seek to address health disparities impacting
children, adolescents, and their adult caregivers. The four U.S. universities have each committed matching funds
totaling $600,000 to support the ACHIEVE program."
11125185,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Nearly 40 million people in the United States annually are provided anesthesia for surgery. Reactive
aldehydes, produced during surgery, are toxic metabolites which drive cellular dysfunction and end organ
damage. For Asian Americans that are descents from East Asia a genetic variant (present in nearly 540
million people in the world) severely limits reactive aldehyde metabolism. Besides inefficient reactive aldehyde
metabolism, several other genetic differences occur for Asians within the lipid peroxidation pathway; a pathway
which regulates damage that occurs during organ injury. As mortality following surgery is the third leading
cause of death in the United States, with organ injury a major cause of this mortality, understanding how these
genetic differences in Asians may alter lipid peroxidation-induced organ damage could unlock novel treatment
strategies for all ethnicities to reduce organ injury occurring during surgery.
For this MIRA program, we will study the genetic differences existing within the lipid peroxidation pathway for
Asians, including the genetic variant which causes inefficient reactive aldehyde metabolism and the impact on
organ injury. To carry out these studies, we generated tools to study reactive aldehydes in the basic science
laboratory including a knock-in mouse model to reflect the human genetic variant that causes inefficient
reactive aldehyde metabolism and sensitive assays to detect reactive aldehydes. We will use these tools to
examine whether an analgesic given during surgery exacerbates cellular injury for rodents with inefficient
aldehyde metabolism. Further, we will also study how reactive aldehydes may impact a transient receptor
potential channel to trigger organ injury. We also expanded these aldehyde tools by developing non-invasive
methods to assess reactive aldehyde levels in humans and methods to identify phenotypes for inefficient
reactive aldehyde metabolism. We plan to use these tools in humans undergoing surgery to identify people
with inefficient reactive aldehyde metabolism and monitor their aldehyde levels during surgery in real-time.
Asian Americans are one of the fastest growing populations in the United States and are projected to reach
nearly 34 million by the year 2050. Asian Americans will require specific anesthetic plans for surgeries due to
genetic differences in the lipid peroxidation pathway, including genetics which cause inefficient reactive
aldehyde metabolism. Providing precision medical care for people who require surgery with this genetic
variant will ultimately reduce health care costs and improve quality of care for a large subset of Asian
Americans. As we describe here, studying genetic differences can also provide insight into biological
mechanisms and unlock novel strategies that can impact medical care for people of all ethnicities."
11128010,"Abstract: eDyNAmiC (extrachromosomal DNA in Cancer)
Human genes are arranged on 23 pairs of chromosomes, but in cancer, tumour-promoting genes can free
themselves from chromosomes and relocate to circular, extrachromosomal pieces of DNA (ecDNA). These
ecDNA do not follow the normal “rules” of chromosomal inheritance, enabling tumours to achieve far higher
levels of cancer-causing oncogenes than would otherwise be possible, and licensing cancers with a way to
evolve and change their genomes to evade treatments at rates that would be unthinkable for human cells. The
altered circular architecture of ecDNAs also changes the way that the cancer-causing genes are regulated and
expressed, further contributing to aggressive tumour growth. These unique features make ecDNA-containing
cancers especially aggressive and difficult to treat. Cancer patients whose tumours harbour ecDNA have
markedly shorter survival. Despite being first seen over fifty years ago, the critical importance of ecDNA has
only recently come to light, and the scale of the problem is substantial. ecDNAs are present in nearly half of all
human cancer types and potentially up-to a third of all cancer patients. The collective current understanding of
how ecDNA form, how they function, how they move around the cell, how they evolve to resist treatment, how
they impact the immune system, and how they can be effectively targeted are lacking. We bring together an
internationally recognized, pioneering interdisciplinary team of cancer biologists, geneticists, computer
scientists, evolutionary biologists, mathematicians, clinicians, and patient advocates to boldly create novel
insights and resources and to provide transformative solutions to one of Cancer’s Grand Challenges. A core
team of experienced and productive ecDNA investigators will work with new investigators in the ecDNA and
cancer fields to bring completely new perspectives and approaches to this daunting challenge. By bridging
cutting-edge and diverse approaches and insights from cancer genomics, yeast genetics, epigenomics,
artificial genome synthesis, longitudinal patient tracking, combinatorial and machine learning algorithms,
mathematical modelling, immunobiology, and innovative chemistry we will develop a new understanding of the
role of ecDNA in cancer, and we will find new ways to drug the undruggable. This bold programme, which
consists of 7 work packages and a committed international infrastructure, generates new and unusual
collaborations that would simply be impossible under any other type of funding mechanism. Our programme
endeavours to foster bold innovative solutions to one of the hardest problems in cancer and to one of the
greatest challenges facing cancer patients."
11126424,"SUPPLEMENT PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 80% of people who use tobacco live in low- and middle-income countries. In South Africa, an
upper-middle-income country, tobacco smoking prevalence among adults was 26% in 2021. South Africa is
also home to the world’s largest HIV epidemic. As improved access to antiretroviral therapy has decreased
deaths from advanced HIV disease, tobacco-related diseases account for an increasing proportion of deaths
among people with HIV. Clinical and public health strategies to decrease tobacco use are urgently needed in
South Africa and elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, where tobacco use is rising.
We conducted a telephonic survey about tobacco use among a subset of participants in the Vukuzazi program,
a large community-based cohort study in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, investigating the intersection of
communicable and non-communicable diseases. Recognizing an obligation to address tobacco dependence,
we developed and provided a brief telephonic tobacco cessation counseling intervention for people who
reported actively using tobacco. Additionally, we inquired about participants’ tobacco use before, during, and
after South Africa’s 2020 tobacco sales ban.
In this supplement project, we will analyze these data to evaluate the impact of telephonic tobacco cessation
counseling (clinical intervention) and the tobacco sales ban (public health intervention) on tobacco use among
people with and without HIV in rural South Africa. The results of this project will provide valuable information to
public health officials, clinicians, HIV care programs, and policymakers about targeted approaches to decrease
tobacco use."

The MACS WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS) is the largest ongoing longitudinal cohort study
of adults living with and without HIV. To date, the MWCCS has followed more than 13,828 unique
participants and collected data at 285,840 person-visits over a 40-year period. This study has
generated a large body of high-dimensional data including clinical, behavioral, social, genomic, and
metabolomic. These data have led to more than 3000 peer-reviewed publications and are in high
demand by investigators. Despite extensive documentation of the data, given their complexity, it
can be challenging for investigators to understand what data is available for use. Therefore, efforts
to make the MWCCS data more discoverable to investigators would be valuable and are aligned
with the mission of the MWCCS Data Analysis and Coordinating Center (DACC). The goal of this
proposal is to engage with the team at GO FAIR US to make the MWCCS data more discoverable to
investigators and more interoperable with the NIAID data environment and other repositories
across multiple platforms. We aim to 1) provide standardized metadata to share with the NIAID
Data Ecosystem Discovery Portal, 2) develop aggregate-level count tables to populate a basic data
dashboard, and 3) plan technologic feasibility for future data visiting of study data."
11126303,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
With the increasing demand for and emerging data regarding long-acting injectable (LAI) antiretroviral therapy
(ART), there is a growing need to understand its impact on and potential among adolescents and young adults
(AYA), a group with historically low adherence to oral ART and high risk of virologic failure. Despite promising
new data on long-acting cabotegravir and rilpivirine's (LA-CAB/RPV) efficacy and safety, critical questions
remain about its long-term effectiveness and the risks associated with prior low adherence. The AFINAty study
addresses these gaps by investigating the effectiveness and feasibility of LA-CAB/RPV in AYA in Cape Town,
South Africa. The AFINAty study team has unexpectedly acquired two additional years of study drug (from
Johnson and Johnson) providing us with the serendipitous and unforeseen opportunity to obtain new data on
virologic suppression, drug concentrations and genotypes within the study cohort. By integrating these findings
into a validated computer simulation model, we aim to project the clinical and economic impact of incorporating
baseline genotypic information into clinical decision-making. This comprehensive analysis will provide
actionable insights into optimizing LA-ART usage, enhancing adherence and clinical outcomes for AYA with
HIV. Ultimately, the study will inform global HIV treatment strategies and improve long-term health outcomes
for this understudied population.
Supplement Aim 1. To collect and analyze predictors of durable virologic suppression in the AFINAty cohort,
including both drug concentrations and genotypic information.
Supplement Aim 2. Using the CEPAC-AYA simulation model, to determine the clinical impact, cost and cost-
effectiveness of baseline genotyping vs. clinical history to inform LA-CAB/RPV selection among individuals
who are virologically suppressed and initiating this treatment modality.
Our overall objective is to leverage a critical opportunity to understand viral suppression, drug concentration
and genotypic data over a three-year period among AYA in AFINAty. These data are not available anywhere in
the world, and will add tremendous value to the parent grant, consistent with its originally approved objectives."
11125035,"The cGAS-STING pathway is a crucial signaling pathway of the innate immune system. The STING signaling
mechanisms in myeloid cells are well studied. However, STING expression in healthy and diseased tissue and
STING signaling activities in other cell types are much less understood. In the previous funding period, we
generated the StingS365A mouse, which allowed us to uncover many IFN-independent activities of STING in T
cells and their physiological significance in diseases. In this renewal application, we created a Sting reporter
mouse and discovered interesting dynamics of STING expression in T cells from development to maturity. We
have also created additional transgenic mice that allow us to modulate STING expression and signaling in
specific tissues or cell types. Our main hypothesis is that dynamic regulation of STING expression and
signaling is essential for maintaining T cell development, homeostasis, and functionality in response to cancer.
Aim 1 will define the regulatory mechanism of STING expression in T cells. Aim 2 will determine how STING
signaling regulates T cell development and function. Aim 3 will define the role of STING in thymopoiesis and T
cell immunity in cancer. Through these studies, we hope to uncover a new facet of STING biology that uniquely
connects innate and adaptive immunity. The potential influence of STING signaling on thymopoiesis also has
immediate clinical implications for the successful development of STING agonists as cancer immunotherapy."
11127000,"Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common cause of neurodegenerative dementia after
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It is rapidly progressive, with a median time from diagnosis to death or nursing home
admission that is half that seen in AD, with extensive burden on patients and family caregivers. There is a great
unmet medical need, with no approved treatments, only AD and Parkinson’s disease (PD) drugs used off-label
to partially or temporarily relieve some of its severe cognitive and motor symptoms. The proposed treatment,
neflamapimod, an orally bioavailable, highly specific inhibitor of the intracellular enzyme p38 mitogen activated
protein kinase alpha (p38α), is in clinical development by EIP Pharma with a phase 2a study in DLB and phase
2 studies in early AD already completed. Preclinical data indicate that neflamapimod, through inhibiting p38α,
therapeutically targets specific pathogenic mechanisms underlying dysfunction and degeneration of neurons in
the basal forebrain, considered to be the major pathogenic drivers of dementia in DLB, e.g., increasing the
number of functioning basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in Ts2 transgenic (Down syndrome) mice that develop
neurodegeneration in the basal forebrain cholinergic system. With a strong scientific rationale for neflamapimod
as a disease modifying treatment for DLB, neflamapimod received Fast-Track designation by the FDA for DLB.
A completed phase 2a exploratory (i.e., hypothesis-generating) clinical trial (NCT04001517) in 91 patients with
mild-to-moderate DLB provided preliminary evidence of clinical efficacy of neflamapimod on various cognitive,
motor, and functional aspects of the disease. The current funded project (R01AG080536) conducts a phase 2b
trial to confirm and expand upon these results. The Specific Aims are to, in the context of performing a phase
2b randomized, double- blind, placebo-controlled, 16-week treatment study of neflamapimod (40mg TID) in 160
subjects with mild DLB: (Aim 1). Demonstrate that neflamapimod improves cognition and function, based on
primary (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes) and secondary (Timed Up and Go test, a
Neuropsychological Test Battery, The Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – Clinical Global Impression of
Change) efficacy measures in patients with mild DLB; (Aim 2). Assess neuropsychiatric outcomes and
safety/tolerability during neflamapimod treatment in these subjects; and (Aim 3). Assess effects of neflamapimod
on electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of DLB, markers of basal forebrain cholinergic dysfunction. Newly
added Aim 4 assesses a proposed biomarker of therapeutic activity in the basal forebrain by structural and
functional MRI. Successful completion of this phase 2b trial will inform our pivotal phase 3 trial, advancing
neflamapimod as a disease-modifying treatment for DLB and providing hope for these patients and their families."
11131349,"Project Summary/Abstract
Up to half of Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease-related dementias (AD/ADRD) cases are due to
potentially modifiable exposures, including psychosocial factors. Exposure to traumatic events over the
lifecourse is pervasive, particularly in groups that experience disproportionately high burden of AD/ADRD. Stress
sensitization models suggest that trauma exposure, especially in early life, can result in brain changes and
increase vulnerability to psychopathology. However, stress sensitization models have not been extended to late-
life neurological outcomes and very little research exists on effects of lifecourse traumatic stress exposure on
AD/ADRD risk. The scientific objective of this research plan is to understand effects of traumatic stress on
cognition and neuroimaging in late life and to identify factors that modify these effects, including late-life
contributors to resilience. Using state-of-the art statistical methods, the research will: (1) estimate the effect of
traumatic stress over the lifecourse on late-life cognitive decline, dementia, and neuroimaging biomarkers of
AD/ADRD, (2) identify individual characteristics and early-life factors (e.g. sex/gender, race/ethnicity, education)
that modify the impact of lifecourse traumatic stress on late-life cognitive decline and dementia, (3) test the stress
sensitization model to determine if childhood trauma and adversity modifies the effect of adulthood traumatic
stress on late-life cognitive decline and dementia, and (4) identify late-life resilience factors (e.g. social
support/integration, financial security, physical activity) that mitigate the impact of lifecourse traumatic stress on
late-life cognitive decline and dementia. The proposed data work uses data from the US nationally-representative
Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and pooled data from two newly available, harmonized, and diverse cohorts
with robust neurocognitive assessments (Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences [KHANDLE] and
Study of Healthy Aging in African Americans [STAR]). The research addresses the NIA strategic research
directions related to understanding effects of personal, interpersonal, and societal factors on aging and
disparities in aging. Understanding the impact of lifecourse traumatic stress, including effect modifiers and late-
life resilience factors, will improve understanding of determinants of AD/ADRD and inform actionable strategies
to prevent AD/ADRD and reduce AD/ADRD disparities. This research plan is complemented by a training plan
that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training to (1) gain
strong foundational knowledge in the science and methods of brain and cognitive aging research; (2) develop
expertise in the study of trauma and traumatic stress and their impact on brain health, and (3) gain skills in
machine learning approaches for causal inference and identifying heterogeneous treatment effects. The
combined research and training plans will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career
focused on understanding trauma and other psychosocial determinants of AD/ADRD in diverse populations."
11128397,"Remapping of function after stroke relies on the rewiring of cortical circuitry. These structural 
modifications of circuits likely depend on nanoscale alteration in the molecular architecture of individual 
synapses that generate alternate connectivity and strengthen surviving contacts. NMDA- and AMPA-type 
glutamate receptors play critical roles in regulating structural and functional plasticity of synapses. 
Following a stroke, the signaling via AMPARsand NMDARs changes, likely due to changes in their 
nanoscale localization. The small size of synapses has prevented us from understanding how synaptic 
nano-architecture is altered by stroke and how nanoscale synaptic changes might lead to functional 
recovery, limiting our ability to target synapses for stroke intervention. Our proposal seeks to break down 
this barrier by combining state-of-the-art STEDsuper-resolution imaging with behavioral analyses of 
sensorimotor function in the mouse model of stroke. Our preliminary data indicate that AMPARsand 
NMDARs exhibit distinct organizational principles relative to spine size and presynaptic release sites, 
suggesting that the exact set of nanoscale rules governs synaptic transmission and plasticity. We will 
test the hypothesis that precise nanoscale remodeling of individual spine synapses underlies the 
functional recovery after stroke. In aim 1, we will determine how changes in pre- and post-synaptic 
nano-architecture on cortical pyramidal neurons are linked to functional recovery after stroke. By imaging 
the organization of scaffolding (PSD-95 and Bassoon) and functional (AMPARs, NMDARs, Munc-13) 
components of synapses in early and late phases of recovery after stroke, we will establish how changes 
in synaptic nano-architecture relate to the recovery of sensorimotor function in both young and old mice. 
In aim 2, we will determine the role of ephrin-B3 on the remodeling of spine nano-architecture on cortical 
pyramidal neurons during stroke recovery. Testing ephrin-B3 null mice in sensorimotor behavioral 
paradigms, we will determine whether ephrin-B3 is required for the functional recovery after stroke. 
Finally, using two-photon and STEDimaging of dendritic spines in the somatosensory cortex, we will 
determine whether ephrin-B3 regulates synaptic remodeling after stroke. Novel molecular insights 
gained from this research will improve our understanding of stroke pathology while providing 
mechanistic underpinnings into functional recovery."

11123762,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is an urgent need for nonhuman primate models of neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental, and
neuropsychiatric disorders to help with development of therapies designed to advance brain health. Among
NHPs, the common marmoset [Callithrix jacchus (cj)] affords a highly tractable option because of its small size,
short lifespan, production of multiple offspring/year and accurate recapitulation of human neuroanatomy.
However, the ultimate utility of the marmoset model remains in its infancy due to the paucity of efficient tools to
facilitate studies requiring genetic modification, especially those needed to recapitulate complex aspects of brain
health. To address this urgent need, the parent project proposed an innovative, more efficient approach to
achieve gene editing and transgenesis in marmosets based on the novel use of highly manipulable induced
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that can be differentiated to form male germ cells that can ultimately be used to
produce transgenic offspring carrying precisely edited alleles of genes relevant to brain health and disease. In
Aim 2 of the parent grant, we are optimizing derivation and transplantation of male cjiPSC-derived germ cells
into recipient testes and grafts to foster development of transgenic sperm. Here, we are proposing supplemental
support for a promising undergraduate candidate to be involved with experiments in this Aim 2 to expose her to
this cutting-edge research in marmosets using spatial transcriptomics, stimulate her continued interest in pursuit
of a research career and provide her with new skills that will benefit her prospects as a career researcher."
11126937,"Project Summary
The cornea and sclera are the principal load bearing members in the tough fibrous ocular tunic which we consider
to be an integrated mechano-biological structure. During development, the shape of the eye has been tuned to
conform to a specific mechanical environment through a long time-scale integration of its loading history with
its initial genetic patterning. Although mechanics are known to contribute to the development of many
connective tissues, the ocular globe is particularly sensitive to pressure (tensile wall stress) during the expansive
phase of growth. Even in the mature ocular tunic, mechanical instabilities often manifest as conditions which
disrupt vision (e.g. myopia, keratoconus, post-LASIK ectasia, tractional retinal detachments and glaucoma).
While the underlying causes of tissue structural instabilities are poorly understood, we suspect that they are
mechanobiological in nature and potentially reflect an imbalance in the tensional homeostasis that exists
between mesenchymal cells, their local ECM and the global mechanical environment. We know that during
development, disruption of the mechanical connection between fibroblastic cells and their ECM severely retards
ocular growth in a manner analogous to pressure loss, suggesting that mechanical communication is critical to
proper ocular morphogenesis. However, the effect of mechanical forces on the mechanisms which drive tissue
formation and growth are not well characterized. It is remarkable that we still do not fully understand how the
most important structural molecule in vertebrates, collagen, is efficiently assembled into highly-organized,
functional, load-bearing tissues which are massively expanded into macroscale structures during growth.
However, if we are able to uncover new mechanisms which control tissue formation and growth, we will have
access to information which can inform therapies for a variety of pathological conditions including fibrosis,
myopia, keratoconus and potentially, glaucoma. Additionally, if we understand how tissue is produced, then
there will be implications for engineering corneas de novo and for improving approaches to regenerative corneal
medicine. The proposed microscope purchase will replace a failing microscope that would allow us to effectively
combine our human cell culture model of corneal stromal tissue elaboration with live-cell mechanodynamics
imaging to directly observe single collagen molecules during their transition from solution to fibrils. We will use
the replacement equipment to directly test a new hypothesis which directly couples local and globally applied
forces directly to molecular assembly of collagen during fibrillogenesis and growth. The working hypothesis for
the parent proposal is that force causes corneal stromal ECM elaboration to regulate fibril assembly, remodeling
and growth. If the hypothesis is correct, there are myriad mechanotherapeutic opportunities and more critically,
our basic understanding of collagenous tissue formation and growth, will be fundamentally altered."

Optic neuropathies are common causes of blindness worldwide, affect the lives of millions, and lack effective
treatments to restore vision. Autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA) is an inherited optic neuropathy that
affects ~3 per 100,000 people worldwide, results in vision impairment, and has no treatment. It is primarily due
to mutations in the optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) gene, which encodes a mitochondrial dynamin-related protein critical
for mitochondrial stability and energy production. A major limitation to the development of effective therapies for
optic neuropathies is the use of animal models that poorly replicate the human condition. Particularly for optic
nerve and RGC disorders, studies would benefit from the use nonhuman primates (NHP) with optic nerve and
retinal anatomy, physiology and pathology, which closely mirrors that of humans. Consequently, well-defined
NHP models of optic neuropathy that are more predictive of human conditions are necessary to efficiently
advance new therapies. We identified rhesus macaques heterozygous and homozygous for a missense mutation
in OPA1 that demonstrate optic nerve head pallor and thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer in comparison to
wildtype controls; these findings are consistent with ADOA in human patients. We will fully define this NHP model
of ADOA and determine its impact on RGC structure and function longitudinally over a 5-year period. Specifically,
we will assess the onset and progression of retinal dysfunction utilizing electroretinography, retinal flavoprotein
fluorescence and visual testing. Importantly, we will correlate the clinical findings with detailed transcriptomic,
histologic, and immunohistochemical data for a comprehensive characterization of this NHP model of ADOA.
The ADOA transcriptome from NHPs is highly likely to identify novel genes and pathways involved in RGC
pathology and neurodegeneration as well as validate previously implicated pathways thus revealing new
therapeutic targets. We will also perform detailed histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural analyses
to assess RGC soma, axons and dendrites as well as their mitochondrial size and number in the macula,
papillomacular bundle, and periphery of the retina. Finally, through selective breeding of ADOA-affected NHPs,
we will generate a supply of macaques heterozygous and homozygous for the OPA1 mutation for future study.
To make this new NHP optic neuropathy model available for therapeutic testing, we propose three Specific Aims:
1) To define the morphologic features and phenotypic spectrum of a NHP model of ADOA, 2) to determine the
impact of the OPA1 A8S mutation on RGC function in NHPs, and 3) to determine mRNA and protein expression
in RGCs of ADOA-affected NHPs. Once the most predictive endpoints of disease and sufficient animals with
ADOA are identified, we will pursue additional studies of etiopathogenesis and novel therapeutic strategies. This
comprehensive NHP model of ADOA will be a highly valuable resource for the vision science and
neurodegenerative disease communities."

The overarching goal of this project is to determine how social stress, due either to differences
in social status or lack of social integration, influences innate immunity over the lifespan of bats.
Bats are proposed for study because of their extraordinary longevity and sociality. No other
mammalian group exhibits comparable longevity relative to body size or variation in sociality. In
addition, recent evidence indicates that some bats do not exhibit several hallmarks of aging and
can modulate their immune response to tolerate high levels of virus exposure. The four species
chosen for study are distantly related, include some of the longest-lived species from three
different families, and have been the subject of long-term studies involving individually marked
animals, which makes them uniquely suitable for an aging study. Aim 1 will use gene
expression of mononuclear white blood cells after ex vivo stimulation with lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) to quantify immune response in first year and old (i.e. greater than mean adult lifespan)
individuals of both sexes to determine if there are sex differences in immunity over the lifespan.
DNA methylation will be profiled using a microarray that assays conserved sites and then used
to determine if there are sex differences in epigenetic aging and to identify genomic biomarkers
of aging. Aim 2 will evaluate the effect of social status in males of the four species on both gene
expression and DNA methylation. Male status will be determined either from physical defense of
female groups during the mating season or from estimates of paternity. Aim 3 will assess the
effect of social integration on annual change in gene expression and DNA methylation in two
ways, one of which will utilize variation in female group composition in wild greater spear-nosed
bats and the other will utilize social networks measured at different spatial and temporal scales
using captive vampire bats, which have perhaps the most complex social system of any bat.
The R61 phase of the project will address Aims 1 and 2 in greater spear-nosed bats. The R33
phase will expand the scope of Aims 1 and 2 to include three additional species and will
address Aim 3. The R33 phase will also expand the scope of the DNA methylation profiling by
using whole genome bisulfite sequencing to determine the extent to which sex-specific aging
biomarkers in bats compare to those in humans across the genome. This multispecies approach
has the potential to reveal unique adaptations that contribute to longevity and do not simply
reflect differences between a bat and other mammals."

The National Resource for Translational and Developmental Proteomics, or NRTDP, proposes a constellation of
activities in its second phase of operation. After launching in 2015 and establishing functional programs in each
mission of a P41 BTRR, we now turn toward the proposed granting period from 2020 – 2025 to develop new
technologies and translate them by enabling both practitioners to analyze proteoforms and many collaborators
to understand their biology more deeply. Consistent with changes in the P41 program, we place major emphasis
on enabling basic and clinical research in proteomics, reduction to practice to extend innovations to early
adopters of new implementations of top-down proteomics, which is itself a new concept to many we
encounter. We also embrace mechanisms including corporate partnerships, community engagement, training
and dissemination to ensure a sustainable impact even after the sunset of this P41 National Resource.
After booting up our operation, we now posit three new Technology Research and Development Projects, six
new Driving Biomedical Projects, a highly dynamic set of collaborative projects and an array of Community
Engagement activities to continue serving our unique role within the set of P41 Resources currently supported
by NIGMS. The technology and support emanating from our resource will continue to provide collaborators with
orthogonal data streams and further demonstrate the value of measuring proteins more precisely than is possible
with current-generation technology of “bottom-up” proteomics. From heart disease to cancer research,
neurology and age-related disorders to immunology, the analysis of proteins and proteoforms and their post-
translational modifications will continue to unveil underlying molecular mechanisms through new and cell-specific
technologies for precision proteomics. This will enable clinicians and cell biologists across four major disease
areas, and significantly bolster American interests with an internationally-recognized excellence in a new style
of mass spectrometry-based proteomics that complements existing areas of investment across the nation. The
geographical distribution of collaborators and training activities are consistent with a mature resource that
reaches the level of operation envisaged in the original grant proposal in 2015.
The institutional support is very strong from an environment of Northwestern University on both its basic science
and medical research campuses in the greater Chicago area. Leveraging a team of professional proteomicists
with diverse backgrounds and experiences, the NRTDP has proven to be a highly capable enterprise that returns
strongly on programmatic support received by NIGMS. As a unit, we place high value on attentiveness to the
spirit and the letter of the P41 program, and also seek to synergize with other P41s within the current portfolio
supported by the NIGMS and NIH."
10747324,"eCD4-Ig is a potent and exceptionally broad fusion of the first two domains of CD4 to an antibody Fc
domain and a short tyrosine-sulfated coreceptor-mimetic peptide. In rhesus macaques, adeno-associated
virus (AAV)-expressed eCD4-Ig mediates consistent and very effective long-term protection against SHIV-
AD8 and SIVmac239. eCD4-Ig also has properties that make it especially useful for establishing a
functional cure in rhesus macaques and perhaps in humans. These include its potency, breadth, difficulty-
of-escape, low immunogenicity when expressed by AAV, consistent expression by AAV, potent intrinsic
ADCC activity, and collaboration with serum antibodies to mediate ADCC. These properties allow eCD4-
Ig to circumvent two major problems associated with using AAV-expressed antibodies to establish
functional cures, namely immune clearance and viral escape.
In the forthcoming award period, we will improve the technologies allowing AAV-mediated delivery of
eCD4-Ig by optimizing its expression as an AAV transgene, by eliminating residual antibody responses to
AAV-delivered eCD4-Ig, and by assessing the role of the eCD4-Ig Fc domain in anti-eCD4-Ig antibody
responses and in control an established SIVmac239 infection. These efforts will develop technologies that
can be applied to the ongoing efforts by many laboratories to prevent new infections, to provide long-
acting alternatives to combined antiretroviral therapies, and to reduce the scale of the viral reservoir."
11124291,"Resilience to brain aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a phenomenon whereby cognitive functioning is better than predicted based on chronological age, genetic risk and/or advanced neuropathology, likely because of the presence of as yet unidentified protective factors. These factors, once identified, are expected to provide key targets for treatment and prevention of AD. However, significant barriers limit discovery of the genetic mechanisms of resilience using human genetic methods alone, including: difficulties in identifying large numbers of individuals with asymptomatic AD, extracting age and interacting genetic effects from complex human genomes, controlling environmental factors, and obtaining brain tissue from asymptomatic AD cases. Moreover, it is well known that transcript abundance is not sufficient to infer protein abundance, as they differ spatially, temporally, and in response to learning tasks. Yet, our ability to discern how proteomes change across aging and AD progression is limited by the impossibility of longitudinal molecular analyses on human brain tissues, as well as the technology needed to profile cell type-specific proteomes associated with susceptibility versus resilience to AD. To fill these significant technological and knowledge gaps, here we will develop a robust pipeline using the most translationally relevant mouse models of human brain aging and AD (i.e., the AD-BXDs and their non-transgenic Ntg-BXDs controls) to obtain a longitudinal knowledge base of proteomes in specific cell types that we have found to exhibit robust changes in gene expression associated with highly susceptible and highly resilient phenotypes. We will focus on the hippocampus as it is required for spatial memory formation and recall in mice and humans, and hippocampus-dependent memory deficits are common in AD. Indeed, our work and preliminary data suggest that mouse strain differences in the age at onset and progression of cognitive deficits in the AD-BXDs (from extremely susceptible to resilient) result from cell type-specific differences in gene expression in the hippocampus. We will integrate these mouse data with clinical and omics data from NIA-sponsored AMP-AD and Resilience-AD Consortia to identify molecular drivers of cognitive resilience. In Aim 1, we will identify cell type-specific changes in neuron and microglia protein expression associated with resilience to AD using bioorthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) in AD-BXDs. In Aim 2, we will translate drivers and molecular networks underlying cognitive resilience to human AD cohorts. In Aim 3, we will leverage the unmatched genetic engineering resources at The Jackson Laboratory to functionally validate ‘in-hand’ resilience candidates by determining their effects on memory, hippocampal neuronal excitability, and synaptic plasticity in CRISPRed AD-BXDs. Using this pipeline, we will thereby discover novel and translationally relevant proteins and complexes for consideration under AMP-AD/TREAT-AD drug discovery pipelines to delay or prevent cognitive symptoms in susceptible AD mice, and ultimately AD patients."

Abstract
Most Americans with OUD remain out-of-treatment. Over the past three decades, rates of opioid use, OUD and
overdose have skyrocketed. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), including methadone and BUP, are
the first-line OUD treatments; however, in 2019, after years of Medicaid expansion and MOUD implementation
initiatives, only 1 million of the 7.6 million persons in the US in need of OUD treatment received MOUD, leaving
a large treatment gap. Barriers to MOUD are often structural, including availability, health system
fragmentation, wait times and healthcare providers’ stigma toward people who use drugs (PWUD). Therefore,
structural interventions are needed to increase MOUD access and use. BUP treatment is associated with large
reductions in overdose-related mortality. However, strong racial/ethnic and geographic disparities in BUP
access have emerged with marginalized groups have more limited access to care. “Low-threshold” BUP
models seek to increase BUP access by offering same-day treatment entry, flexibility, harm reduction
counseling, and availability in unconventional settings, such as emergency departments, mobile units, or harm
reduction agencies. The proposed study, Low-threshold buprenorphine treatment at syringe services
programs: a Type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial, targets structural barriers to BUP treatment (e.g.,
health system fragmentation, waiting lists, and medical providers’ stigma towards people with OUD) by
integrating BUP treatment into syringe services programs (SSPs). Dr Hansel Tookes from the Florida Node
Alliance will serve as Co-Lead Investigator and will dedicate effort to protocol development activities."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as “NOT-CA-
24-044. Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) is the deadliest form of endometrial cancer that currently lacks effective
targeted therapies. Moreover, Black women are twice as likely to die from USC than White women in the United
States, consequently, the molecular features that contribute to this disparity are avidly being investigated.
Importantly, USC and high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC) share similar molecular features, clinical
properties, and treatments, suggesting that molecular targeted therapies in HGSOC may be relevant to USC. In
our R01 (CA282766), we are actively exploring the MRCK protein kinases as drug targets for the treatment of
recurrent HGSOC. The overall goal of this administrative supplement is to determine whether MRCKs represent
a therapeutic target in USC, and whether differences in protein kinase activity exists amongst USC tumors
isolated from Black or White women that could contribute to the disparity. Our preliminary studies showed that
inhibition of MRCKs impaired actin cytoskeleton remodeling blocking spheroid invasion of USC cells, suggesting
MRCKs may have therapeutic potential in USC. Moreover, preliminary proteomics assessment of kinase activity
in USC tumors showed that several kinases were elevated that have clinical drugs readily available.
Nevertheless, the mechanistic basis for MRCK support of USC pathogenesis and whether USC tumors isolated
from Black or White women exhibit distinct kinase activation profiles that can be targeted clinically remains poorly
understood. Our overall hypothesis is that MRCKs control spheroid growth and invasion of USC cells and that
USC tumors isolated from Black or White women will exhibit distinct kinase activity signatures that contributes
to disparity in USC incidence. To test this hypothesis, we have designed two Specific Aims, Aim1: Determine
the effect of MRCK inhibition on USC signaling, spheroid growth and invasion and Aim2: Define the kinome
activation signature of USC tumors isolated from Black or White women to rationally predict kinase inhibitor
therapies and to explore racial disparity. In Aim1, we will block MRCK function by genetic ablation or inhibitors
and monitor viability, invasion and actin remodeling of USC spheroids. In Aim 2, we will use proteomics methods
to measure kinase activity in USC tumors and normal endometrium tissues isolated from Black or White women.
We will then use bioinformatics and biostatistics to identify upregulated kinases in USC tumors, as well as
differences in kinase activity amongst USC tumors isolated from Black or White women. Together, the work
proposed here will identify new kinase targets for the treatment of USC and explore the role of kinase signaling
in the disparity of USC amongst Black and White women. Importantly, these findings will be directly relevant to
HGSOC, which can be integrated into our ongoing R01 (CA282766) HGSOC studies."
11126991,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Carbon monoxide (CO) inhalation is a leading cause of human poisoning in the United States, resulting in about
50,000 cases and at least 1,500 deaths annually, as well as long-term cardiac and neurocognitive sequelae for
one-third of survivors. Unfortunately, no point of care antidotal therapy exists for CO poisoning to date. A field-
deployable agent that irreversibly scavenges and sequesters CO could serve as an improved therapeutic that
increases survival and long-term outcomes for patients suffering from CO poisoning. In this proposal, we will
exploit the uniquely strong and specific interaction between CO and ferrous heme by utilizing a hemoprotein
scaffold to develop a high-affinity CO scavenger. We recently discovered a remarkable hemoprotein domain,
found in the bacterial CO-sensing transcription factor RcoM (regulator of CO metabolism), that exhibits a 900-
fold increase in CO binding affinity compared to hemoglobin, the primary biological target in acute CO poisoning.
This RcoM hemoprotein also shows exquisite selectivity for CO over oxygen, a critical property for a CO antidote
that will be infused intravenously in humans under oxygenated conditions. In Aim 1, we will utilize in vitro
spectroscopic methods to identify 1) the minimum functional RcoM subunit, and 2) key amino acid residues that
confer high CO affinity, selectivity, and heme stability. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
three RcoM truncates with highest CO affinity and selectivity in vivo. We will assess systemic and organ-specific
effects of intravenous RcoM delivery in healthy mice and quantify the ability of infused RcoM to scavenge CO,
reverse hemodynamic collapse, and prevent death in a severe preclinical mouse model of CO poisoning. The
outcomes of these aims will provide fundamental insight into hemoprotein ligand selectivity and demonstrate the
therapeutic potential of recombinant RcoM as a treatment for acute CO poisoning. While toxic at high
concentrations, CO, endogenously produced as a by-product of heme degradation, serves as a cytoprotective
signal at low concentrations. Preclinical and clinical studies have explored the use of CO as a therapeutic under
conditions ranging from infection to ischemia/reperfusion injury. Despite potential clinical benefits, the roles of
CO as a signaling molecule are poorly understood, and the CO concentration regimes corresponding to basal
signaling, cytoprotection, and toxicity are poorly defined. A genetically encoded, CO-selective fluorescent
reporter would be the ideal tool to tease apart physiological roles of CO in living systems. In Aim 3, we will
employ the CO-sensing function of RcoM to design a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter, characterize CO-
dependent response in vitro, and incorporate this reporter into the mouse genome using CRISPR/Cas9. We will
quantify CO accumulation in transgenic reporter mice under different CO exposure conditions and define regimes
that give rise to CO signaling, cytoprotection, and toxicity in vivo. Through this aim, we will develop critical
biomolecular tools that will enable elucidation of CO-dependent signaling mechanisms relevant to human health."
11126994,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a progressive disease leading to right heart failure and an unacceptably high
mortality rate. Despite major milestones in our understanding of predisposing factors to PH, to date, we still have
limited mechanistic insight into its development and progression. Thus, despite advances in current therapies,
there is no available cure and treatment has limited improvement in outcome. Therefore, development of drug
treatments with alternate targets may benefit patients. To this end, our published and preliminary studies demon-
strate increased activated microglia, specifically TREM2-expressing disease-associated microglia, contribute to
neuroinflammation in autonomic brain regions, particularly the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothala-
mus. These data informed our central hypothesis that activation of resident microglia, especially TREM2+
microglia subtype and infiltrated myeloid precursors, promotes aberrant preautonomic neuronal signal-
ing in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus leading to sustained sympathetic activation,
which is critical to PH. We plan to test this hypothesis via the following three aims: Aim 1 will evaluate the
microglia-dependent mechanisms that contribute to increased preautonomic neuron activity within the PVN; Aim
2 will evaluate the mechanism by which TREM2 contributes to PH pathophysiology, exploring the working hy-
pothesis that TREM2 expression within microglia is necessary and sufficient for augmented sympathetic activity
and thus, a potential therapeutic targeted. Finally, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that chronic microglia activation
leads to dysautonomia and enhanced systemic inflammation, with consequently increase in circulating myeloid
cells infiltration to autonomic brain regions such as PVN, contributing to neuroinflammation in a feedforward loop,
worsening PH outcomes. Experiments will combine 2-photon microscopy in brain slices, flow cytometry, sympa-
thetic ablation, and several cutting-edge genetic models. Ultimately, we expect results of these studies to con-
tribute to better understanding of the mechanism whereby microglia and infiltrated myeloid precursors contribute
to the pathophysiology of PH. Collectively, the proposed studies will lead to novel information regarding the
brain’s pathogenic contribution to pulmonary hypertension, which may represent an entirely novel target for PH
therapeutics. In addition, strong mentorship by Drs. Andrew Bryant and Eric Krause, as well as a Mentoring
Committee comprised of established professors, who are experts in the proposed techniques and have extensive
mentoring experience; will provide conceptual and methodological training, to achieve the research goals and
prepare me to establish an independent research program."
11127012,"CHALLENGE: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a complex clinical syndrome that
presents with heart failure symptoms, unaltered left ventricular ejection fraction, and is associated with
comorbidities including obesity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. HFpEF accounts for ~50% of all heart failure
(HF) and is characterized by diastolic dysfunction and extensive cardiac fibrosis. The pathophysiology of HFpEF
is not well understood, and there are no evidence-based therapies to treat HFpEF. In pilot studies, we utilized
two-independent HFpEF models – i) 2-hit HFpEF model of hypertension and high-fat diet in mice and ii) obese
ZSF1 rats. Both HFpEF models exhibit diastolic dysfunction, obesity and glucose intolerance. In the mouse
HFpEF model, we observed increased numbers of inflammatory cells in the heart. We also observed an increase
in fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts, upregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and complement
signaling in the hearts HFpEF mice. We hypothesize that exaggerated macrophage infiltration into the left
ventricle (LV) mediates pathological cardiac remodeling in HFpEF by modulating cardiac fibroblast differentiation
and function.
GOAL: Here, we propose to investigate the mechanisms by which inflammatory macrophages cause cardiac
remodeling in HFpEF at the cellular, molecular and functional levels. In Aim 1, we will investigate the mechanisms
by which inflammatory macrophages mediate fibroblast differentiation. We will also assess the contribution of
macrophages to cardiac remodeling and diastolic dysfunction in two independent HFpEF models by depleting
macrophages with clodronate liposomes. In Aim 2, we will determine the effect of complement signaling on
macrophage polarization. We will characterize cardiac macrophage populations in HFpEF models after
complement depletion and examine the role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in cardiac fibroblast function.
The long-term goal of this study is to understand the molecular basis of inflammation-mediated cardiac
remodeling in HFpEF. To facilitate my transition from a mentored postdoctoral fellowship to a stable independent
research position, the K99 phase will be conducted as integrated mentored career development and research
activities, and the R00 phase will be devoted to execution of the proposed research, establishing collaborations,
and writing a DP2 and an R01 grant.
INNOVATION: The proposed work pushes the envelope on multiple novel frontiers. It aims to uncover
mechanisms at the molecular, cellular and functional levels of organization. It integrates two orthogonal fields –
intercellular signaling in cardiovascular disease and regulation of fibroblast function by inflammatory signals. Our
studies will for the first time characterize inflammatory signals that mediate fibroblast activation and cardiac
remodeling in HFpEF. Understanding these mechanisms will help identify therapeutic targets to mitigate cardiac
remodeling in HF."
11124375,"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and other immunotherapies have revolutionized cancer treatment, but the non-responsiveness of most cancers to ICB-based monotherapy remains a significant problem. A major reason for the non-responsiveness of these so-called ‘cold’ tumors is that they lack an immunogenic tumor microenvironment (TME) and thus escape T-cell killing despite expressing ICB targets. How to selectively intensify the immunogenicity of the TME has been an unmet challenge. Here we propose a new approach that utilizes a new oncolytic mutant of Herpes simplex Virus (HSV)1 to increase the immunogenicity of the melanoma TME by triggering ZBP1-dependent necroptosis in the tumor mass. This new approach derives from our prior work on HSV1, which showed that this virus encodes a suppressor of necroptosis: the RIP homology interaction motif (RHIM) within the viral protein ICP6. Mutating this RHIM generates a virus (HSV1mutRHIM) which can no longer block necroptosis, allowing for the first-time exploitation of HSV1-induced necroptosis for therapeutic purposes. HSV1mutRHIM activates ZBP1-dependent necroptosis from the nucleus both human and mouse cells, and such so-called ‘nuclear necroptosis’ is even more immunogenic than conventional (i.e., cytoplasm-initiated) necroptosis, because it results in the release of nuclear DAMPs, such as HMGB-1, IL-33 and Il-1a, into the extracellular space. These findings allow us to propose the hypotheses that by inducing Z-RNAs formation and directly activating ZBP1 to trigger nuclear necroptosis in cells of the TME, this modified oncolytic HSV1mutRHIM will greatly improve ICB treatment outcomes. In this proposal, we will examine whether induction of nuclear necroptosis by modified oncolytic HSV1 enhance immune infiltrate in the TME (Aim 1) and potentiate ICB-based cancer immunotherapy in mouse models of localized and metastatic melanoma (Aim 2). The successful completion of these Aims will outline a next-generation oncolytic HSV1-based strategy to activate highly inflammatory form necroptosis and potentiate ICB-based cancer immunotherapies, with important clinical ramifications for the treatment of melanoma and other cancers."

The purpose of this pilot study is to explore postpartum women’s oral health knowledge, 
attitudes, and behaviors (KABs) during and after pregnancy in Florida, and to identify specific 
barriers and facilitators to dental service use, unmet dental needs, and the intent to use dental 
services in the postpartum period. Oral health is integral to overall health, particularly for 
maternal and infant health outcomes. Despite its importance, many women face barriers to 
accessing dental care during pregnancy, such as financial constraints and lack of awareness, 
leading to untreated disease and poor systemic health. This study addresses a gap in 
understanding the specific oral health needs of postpartum women, especially given recent 
policy changes expanding Medicaid eligibility for postpartum women in Florida.
This study addresses the oral health needs of postpartum women in light of recent Medicaid 
policy changes in Florida that expand eligibility for this population. To capture diverse 
perspectives, the study will develop and administer a survey in both English and Spanish, 
targeting Florida’s growing Hispanic population, which represents 26.4% of the state’s residents, 
with 22.2% identifying Spanish as their primary language. By including Spanish-speaking 
participants, the study aims to provide more nuanced insights into the factors influencing dental 
service use. Data will be collected from postpartum women at UF Health Shands Hospital 
through anonymous surveys. The study will analyze key barriers and facilitators to dental 
service utilization, unmet needs, and intent to seek dental care postpartum, while examining 
relationships between socio-demographic and clinical factors and oral health KABs.
The findings will inform larger-scale studies and interventions, including a planned focus group 
study, and provide preliminary data for a career development award application by Dr. Cilia 
Zayas. This pilot study will lay the groundwork for developing strategies to improve dental health 
outcomes for a diverse postpartum population in Florida."
11126183,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Stagnant survival and relapse rates for adolescents and young adults (AYA) with cancer are partially attributed
to a modifiable health behavior—suboptimal cancer treatment adherence. Yet, effective interventions are lacking.
Aligned with priorities of the NCI and other federal agencies, the long-term objective of this K08 application is to
help resolve disparities in cancer treatment outcomes in AYA by targeting nonadherence to life-saving cancer
treatments. The goal of this proposal is to employ novel real time mobile health methodologies to examine and
intervene on the time-varying, contextual factors that influence AYA adherence to an oral chemotherapy called
6-mercaptopurine, which must be taken daily in the maintenance phase to prevent relapse. In Aim 1, the PI and
her mentorship team will determine the temporal associations between time-varying contextual factors (such as
fatigue, motivation) and daily 6-mercaptopurine adherence. This Aim will utilize a 6-month intensive longitudinal
design that employs bursts of mobile-based ecological momentary assessment with AYA patients and their
caregivers (n=30 pairs). In Aim 2, the investigative team will begin to develop a just-in-time adaptive mobile
intervention, designed to promote 6-mercaptopurine adherence in this population, by developing contextually-
tailored mobile messages and decision rules about the conditions under which to deliver the messages. Just-in-
time mobile interventions are well-suited to address limitations of previous interventions by providing
personalized adherence support, at the right time, only when it is needed. The creation of messages and decision
rules will follow a rigorous mobile health development approach by iteratively incorporating self-management
theory, empirical evidence, expert input, and stakeholder feedback. Focus groups with 15 AYA from Aim 1 will
be conducted to user-test and refine the messages. In Aim 3, the just-in-time adaptive mobile intervention called
ADAPTS (Adherence Assessments and Personalized Timely Support) will be pilot tested in a micro-randomized
trial with 30 newly recruited patients and their caregivers. ADAPTS will integrate the tailored mobile messages
and decision rules developed and refined in Aim 2. The research team will determine the feasibility and
acceptability of this intervention in preparation for the PI’s larger-scale optimization trial (R01 proposal). This
proposal has methodological, theoretical, clinical, and technological innovations. The research and career
development plan, supported by a multi-disciplinary team of experts in a rich academic environment, will support
the PI’s transition to an independent clinician-scientist who possesses the skills and expertise to use cutting-
edge mobile health methods to design the most potent adherence- promotion interventions for pediatric cancer
patients. This K08 will provide opportunities to acquire skills and knowledge in: 1) ecological momentary
assessment and multi-level statistics; 2) behavior change intervention development applied to mobile health,
and; 3) the conduct of clinical trials and intervention dissemination and implementation."

Abstract of the funded parent award (5 U01 AI160421-04)
Infectious diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the expanding older population. While
vaccines are efficient measures to prevent infections, a critical problem is that aging-associated changes in the
immune system lead to decreased immunogenicity and clinical efficacy of most currently used vaccines. Novel
strategies that increase vaccination efficacy and specifically target the aged immune system are imperative. An
essential facet of these efforts is the use of combinatory adjuvants that synergistically potentiate more effective
vaccine-induced immune responses against various pathogens. In this project we will define the mechanism of
action (MOA) of a combination of a unique parasite protein adjuvant, rASP-1 with each of three well-
characterized innate adjuvants: STING, TLR7/8 and RIG-I agonists, known to activate cytoplasmic pattern
recognition receptors and Type I IFN signaling, which are specifically dampened in the aged population. We
have shown that rASP-1 is a powerful adjuvant as it activates human and mouse dendritic cells to potentiate the
differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th1, Th17 and Tfh-like cells. Transcriptomic analyses of rASP-1-
activated hMoDCs revealed upregulation of the MyD88-independent activation pathway and interferon related
genes. In mice, rASP-1 elicits a balanced Th1/Th2 antibody response, Th1-biased cellular immunity, and
enhanced responses when co-administered with vaccines leading to increased survival following microbial
challenge. Importantly, our preliminary data indicate that rASP-1 in combination with 2'3'-cGAMP (STING), R848
(TLR7/8) or 5'3p-hpRNA (RIG-I) in activated adult and aged mouse BMDCs can dramatically synergize beyond
merely additive effects; it enhanced secretion of IL-12p40, IP-10 and/or IL-10. The synergy is exceptionally
evident when it activates aged mouse BMDCs with the STING ligand. Therefore, we hypothesize that combining
rASP-1 with STING, TLR7/8 or RIG-I agonists will synergistically activate early innate immune signaling that
critically contributes to the establishment and nature of immune responses, and the duration and intensity of
immune activation. We posit that this will help restore the aging-associated deficits in the critical regulatory
pathways of the antiviral responses. Through comprehensive immunologic and transcriptomic analyses, the
MOA through which rASP-1 in combination with these three PRR agonists leads to optimal activation of helper
T cells driving humoral and cellular antiviral responses will be established in both mouse (Aim 1) and human
(Aim 2) DCs (adult and aged), to establish that they are conserved, and then test their efficacy in vivo in adult
and aged mice using the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) as a model antigen (Aim 3). This project
brings together a dynamic team with a history of collaboration and complementary expertise in vaccinology,
immunology, biochemistry, innate cell receptor biology, adjuvants, and bioinformatics. We will deliver a novel,
efficacious combination of innate cytoplasmic PRR adjuvants with rASP-1 that promotes protective long-lived
adaptive responses and boosts efficacy of vaccines in aged populations."

Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE): A Plan for America has prioritized the vital role of collaboration across
Department of Health and Human Services federal agencies as well as state and local jurisdictions in order to
achieve the ambitious goals of a 75% reduction of new HIV cases by 2025, and a 90% reduction by 2030.
Implementation Science, although squarely anchored to the research enterprise, is uniquely positioned to
achieve cross-agency coordination and collaboration due to the intrinsic focus on context, spanning community,
clinical, and public health environments. Leveraging extant National Institutes of Health (NIH) HIV research
resources afforded by the CFAR and AIDS Research Centers (ARC) programs, a multisite Implementation
Science Hub network was established in FY 2020, with a data coordinating center. The University of Alabama
at Birmingham (UAB) CFAR Implementation Science Hub is fully committed to building upon the foundation
established during the inaugural three years of funding as part of this synergistic, integrated HIV implementation
science community. This will be achieved via the provision of technical assistance, coaching, training, and
consultative services to assigned EHE supplement awardees as a Regional Consultation Hub (RCH) and
coordination and collaboration with the Coordination, Consultation and Data Management Center (CCDMC),
with added value via the engagement of scientists pursuing and conducting NIH funded, EHE aligned
implementation science grants at UAB and/or via national inter-CFAR networks (e.g., CFAR Network of
Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS)). Our interdisciplinary UAB CFAR IS hub team is committed to accelerating
innovation in HIV community engagement, health equity, prevention, healthcare delivery, treatment, and care.
Beyond supporting investigators on scientific matters pertaining to IS research designs, frameworks, measures,
and evaluation, we have provided vital guidance with pragmatic issues pertaining to academic-public health
partnerships, collaboration and publications, community engaged science, and regulatory and compliance
considerations, paramount to the success of projects conducted with non-traditional clinical, community and
public health research partners. Proposed activities are well aligned with NIH HIV/AIDS Research Priorities,
most notably substantively supporting research in the cross-cutting areas of “health disparities, behavioral and
social sciences research, epidemiology, information dissemination, implementation sciences, and training,” and
will be achieved via five specific aims: Aim 1: Coaching is centered on developing a project development plan
with each supplement / project PI, Aim 2: Consultation systematically includes guidance on application of the
IS logic model and identification of appropriate outcome measures for each project utilizing the IS cross walk,
Aim 3: Dissemination includes guidance on scholarly products informed by the project development plan, Aim
4: Collaboration is achieved with CCDMC and the other RCHs via the cross-site evaluation working group,
multi-site training seminars and workshops, and by engaging with NIH R-series, and Aim 5 Conducting a cross-
Hub multisite pilot implementation research project."

This is a proposal for continuing support of the Center for Demography of Health and Aging (CDHA) at the
University of Wisconsin-Madison. The overall goal of CDHA is to sustain and improve a major research and
training program in the demography of health and aging. The institutional architecture of CDHA is
designed to create links between social demography, economics, biomedical and epidemiological research
on health and aging. Major themes of ongoing and developmental research activities within CDHA include
1) Aging and the Life Course; (2) Biodemography, including data collection and analytical work with
biomarkers, gene-environment interactions and the microbiome; (3) Determinants of sociodemographic
disparities of aging trajectories; (4) Assessing the organization, technology, policy, and delivery of care; and
(5) Place-based impacts on health and aging. CDHA is an autonomous research unit within the College of
Letters and Science where it coexists with the Center for Demography and Ecology. It thus shares and
extends a well-developed research infrastructure in administration, computing facilities and data library,
and dissemination capacity. CDHA’s Administrative Core (A) provides leadership and administrative
support for the Center as a whole, particularly for activities of Core B. The Program Development Core (B)
supports faculty, staff, and research assistants engaged in innovative, high-risk pilot research projects that
are likely to lead to major NIA support. The External Innovative Network Core (C) will continue a highly
successful and popular, networked current awareness service for research in the demography of health and
aging and support regular workshops, conferences, and visits. The External Research Resources Core (D)
supports the analysis of large-scale public and restricted-use data resources in the demography of health
and aging and disseminates important research findings. The Remote Data Enclave (E) supports the
analysis of sensitive data under secure conditions and integrates with a state-of-the art Federal Statistical

11126377,"EMS encounters for opioid overdose and withdrawal have escalated along with the national opioid use
disorder (OUD) crisis. Despite the efficacy of buprenorphine treatment for patients with OUD, and
effectiveness of initiation of buprenorphine in the emergency department (ED) setting, the treatment gap
remains wide. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) is often the first encounter a person with OUD has with the
healthcare system, either after overdose reversal or for treatment for moderate to severe opioid withdrawal.
Unfortunately, some patients refuse transport, or leave against medical advice once they arrive in the ED.
Thus, buprenorphine offered as out-of-hospital emergency care could provide a vital strategy opportunity for
initiation of life saving treatment and referral for ongoing OUD care. Current evidence for EMS initiated
buprenorphine is limited to small retrospective or nonrandomized prospective cohort studies. While promising,
these studies suffer from lack of intervention fidelity, bias, and uncontrolled confounders. EMS-based research
has the potential to expand the reach of ED- and outpatient-based OUD interventions, and significantly
enhance availability of evidence-based addiction care into settings where preventing adverse consequences
of untreated opioid use is critically important. During the 8-month project period, our Specific Aim is to:
Develop a study protocol for prehospital EMS-initiated buprenorphine treatment for patients with OUD
presenting with (a) overdose requiring a naloxone reversal or (b) acute opioid withdrawal to promote
engagement in OUD treatment. Our approach will use a Delphi Consensus Method with a panel of emergency
medicine, EMS, and OUD care content experts. The study protocol will be refined through subsequent focus
groups with EMS personnel and patients with OUD to ensure protocol feasibility and acceptability. Over
subsequent study years we will conduct a sequence of pragmatic controlled field studies to test
implementation of the protocol, followed by a randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of EMS delivered
buprenorphine on linkage to addiction treatment."
11126379,"PROGRAM SUMMARY
The objective of our LAUNCH program is to continue our global health research training program called the
Global Health Equity Scholars (GHES) designed to create a new community of researchers, educators, and
professionals who are prepared to address new and emerging global health challenges. We will build on the last
nine years of this training program to create a cadre of new researchers who will dedicate their research careers
to address the health problems that arise out of the inequity of human conditions prevalent in informal human
settlements (also referred to as slums). Rather than addressing one disease at a time, we propose to provide a
comprehensive, multidisciplinary, and integrated approach to deal with urban and rural informal human
settlement health issues, developed over many years by the participating faculty members of this program. This
program will comprise four US partner institutions (Consortium)--Yale University, Stanford University, University
of Arizona, and University of California at Berkeley, each led by a leader in global health research with more
than 10 years of collaboration among themselves. Together, core faculty mentors from these institutions conduct
research at 25 institutions in 21 countries, representing regions of Africa, Central and South America, the
Caribbean, Asia, the Pacific, and Eastern Europe. The GHES program will address a wide range of health
research topics including HIV/AIDs, emerging and high- consequence infectiousdiseases, non-communicable
diseases (NCD), women's health, environmental health, mental health, interpersonal violence, substance abuse,
injuries, and the interaction of all of these health issues within the framework of slum health. Training will target
US postdoctoral fellows and pre-doctoral students and low and middle-income country (LMIC) postdoctoral
fellows. We plan to recruit 9-10 trainees/year with 60% of them as US postdoctoral fellows. The trainees will
spend 8-12-months at an LMIC site under the supervision of the Consortium and their collaborating LMIC
mentors. Workshops on global health research methods, skill building, and career development will be conducted
both in-person and online. LMIC trainees will spend 2-3 months at US institutions to undergo training in methods
not provided at their institutions. All of the trainees will be provided with research and career mentorship
throughout their training and tracked for career development after completion of their GHES-supported research
work. Thus, under this program, we expect the trainees to be exposed to one important theme in global health
research--health equity--through research that deals with health concerns of vulnerable populations residing in
informal human settlements and provide them with an opportunity to become experts in this new global health
discipline. The overall impact of this training program is, therefore, to create a new cadre of global health
researchers and leaders who address the emerging health issues arising out of ever-expanding informal human
settlements of LMICs."

Synapses form trillions of connections between billions of neurons in the brain to establish neural circuits that
allow us to sense, think, act, learn, and remember. Our goal is to understand how synapse structure supports
learning and memory with a focus on dendritic spines, the tiny protrusions that host most of the excitatory
synapses in the brain. While most neuroscientists would agree that synapse growth and retraction are vital for
learning and memory, we do not know how these long-term changes in synaptic structure are regulated in the
face of ongoing brain plasticity. The synaptic active zone comprises discrete domains where presynaptic
vesicles are docked and released. Postsynaptic responses are restricted to regions within ~100 nm of the
vesicle release sites. Our three-dimensional reconstruction from serial section electron microscopy (3DEM)
reveals three zones across the synapse: (i) strong active zones (AZs) that have tightly docked presynaptic
vesicles, (ii) weak AZs that have loose or nondocked presynaptic vesicles, and (iii) nascent zones (NZs) that
have a thick postsynaptic density but no presynaptic vesicles. At the onset of long-term potentiation (LTP),
presynaptic vesicles are rapidly recruited to the NZs, converting them to AZs. Protein filaments shorten and
draw docked presynaptic vesicles closer to the enlarged AZs, and recruit vesicles to dock at weak AZs. This
evidence of presynaptic plasticity would increase the area of release and probability of postsynaptic receptor
response. The recovery interval following saturation of LTP is 1-4 hours depending on the preparation. During
this interval, new NZs form, primarily on spines containing smooth endoplasmic reticulum, a local resource for
regulating calcium and trafficking of lipids, proteins, and organelles. Clusters of spines form in the vicinity of
these enlarged spines. We hypothesize that synapse-specific expansion of NZs during LTP provides a basis
for learning and the advantage of spaced over massed learning to establish long-lasting memories.
Furthermore, we hypothesize that LTD is driven by the conversion of weak AZs to NZs and ultimately
elimination of spines without AZs. To address these hypotheses, we propose multidisciplinary approaches to
investigate NZ and AZ plasticity—including slice physiology, optogenetics, glutamate uncaging, and
tomographic 3DEM of synapses along activated axons labeled with APEX. Our Specific Aims are: Aim 1)
Determine the specificity of NZ to AZ conversion during synapse enlargement, resource utilization, and spine
clustering underlying the saturation, recovery, and enhancement of LTP. Aim 2) Test whether saturating LTP
at an isolated dendritic spine is sufficient to fill NZs and determine the role of PSD-MAGUK proteins and their
interaction partners in the recovery of LTP from saturation. Aim 3) Test whether saturation of long-term
depression (LTD) is accompanied by loss of weak AZs and determine the time-course over which LTD
recovers from saturation. Outcomes promise new insights about synaptic mechanisms of learning and memory
and new targets for understanding and treating learning disabilities."

 Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) associated heart failure is a leading cause of death and new therapeutic
strategies are needed. Pathogenic variants in over 50 genes contribute to DCM, but the molecular mechanisms
of disease are poorly understood. Much remains to be done to understand disease mechanisms and translate
the basic science into therapeutic strategies. The goal of this project is to identify targeted therapeutic strategies
for DCM. This goal aligns with my long-term career goal to become an independent researcher leading an
academic lab that focuses on better understanding human tissue-specific post-transcriptional regulation of gene
expression and developing mechanism-based therapeutics.
 My primary hypothesis, supported by my preliminary results, is that some of the microRNA (miRNA)
upregulated in end stage heart failure (HF) exert a compensatory effect on the disease phenotype and that some
of these miRNAs have mutation-specific beneficial effects while others have effects independent of etiology. I
propose to study the mechanisms of both kinds of miRNA to identify new therapeutic targets.
 In my earlier work, I developed an experimental platform to quantify several of the physiological phenotypes
of DCM in induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). I used this system to identify a
potential therapeutic strategy (published and patented) for a specific variant of DCM. I used this system in my
preliminary work for this project to identify several miRNAs that ameliorate contractile phenotypes in iPSC-CMs
carrying DCM causal variants selected for their diverse molecular etiologies (PLN, RBM20, and TNNT2). As
hypothesized, some miRNAs had etiology-specific beneficial effects while others demonstrated improvement
across all etiologies.
 My first aim is to test candidate miRNA targets to identify the mechanisms through which they exert the
beneficial effect in iPSC-CMs. My second aim is to identify the target genes of candidate miRNAs that regulate
sarcomeric and contractile functions and to test their effect in an alternative in vitro model (Engineered Heart
Tissues) and in a mouse model of DCM. My third aim is to test the hypothesis that the target space differs for
the miRNAs that have a mutation-specific effect and those that have a therapeutic effect on all DCM lines by
comparing the targets of mutation-specific and non-specific therapeutic miRNAs.
 This project will expand our understanding of heart failure mechanisms and identify new points of
intervention for drug development. This project will also identify the etiology-specific and etiology-independent
disease mechanisms leading to DCM and test whether these differences can be exploited therapeutically. The
knowledge and tools generated will be of value to the DCM community and serve as a foundation for my
subsequent, independent work in developing personalized, mechanism-based therapeutic strategies."
11127098,"Project Summary
 M channels are critical for regulating the excitability of neurons. Dysfunction of M channel activity can
cause epilepsy. While M channels have been intensely studied, the interplay of several G-protein-regulated
signaling cofactors on these channels is still poorly understood. M channels are hetero-tetrameric pore
structures formed by the combination of subunits Kv7.2-5. Over 80 mutations have been mapped to the Kv7.2
subunit, being a primary cause of neonatal epilepsy. Many of these mutations lie within the binding domains for
at least three critical signaling cofactors: calmodulin (CaM), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) and
protein kinase (PKC). How PIP2 and CaM binding to Kv7.2 harmonize to fine tune channel activity is obscure.
Moreover, the role played by PKC in tuning this binding is obscure. My preliminary data shows that PIP2 and
CaM may simultaneously bind the B helix with phosphorylation tempering this binding. My NMR studies so far
show that phosphorylation reconfigures the apoCaM-B helix interaction, suggesting the interplay between
these cofactors has significant impact on channel structure. I will test the overarching hypothesis that
phosphorylation at S520 and S527 fine-tunes the ability of PIP2 and CaM to bind to Kv7.2 and control M
channel activity. This hypothesis will be tested using three aims and will provide mechanistic understanding
of how phosphorylation, and dependent PIP2 and CaM binding affects the structure of Kv7.2 to control channel
activity. In Aim 1, I will use advanced 3D and 4D NMR to resolve the solution structure of purified Kv7.2 C
terminus. Aim 2 will use these NMR spectra to define the affinity of PIP2 to Kv7.2 and describe the
stoichiometry and mode of binding between PIP2 and the multiple sites on Kv7.2. Aim 3 will elaborate how
phosphorylation within the B helix directs the interplay between CaM and PIP2 binding to Kv7.2. The proposed
study is innovative because it will address a longstanding question about how and where PIP2 binds Kv7.2,
and will elaborate how phosphorylation directs the interplay between CaM and PIP2 as they bind Kv7.2. My
training in advanced 3D and 4D NMR will be critical for my career advancement as I plan to use this rigorous
technique throughout my career. The rich resources and supportive environment at UT Health combined with
my expertise in biophysical methods on ion channels makes me the ideal candidate to study the mechanisms
underlying the regulation of M channel activity. The MOSAIC career award will provide valuable financial
support to help me begin my multidisciplinary research program focused on elucidating the molecular
mechanisms of ion channel regulation."

Autoimmune diseases affect up to 8% of the US population and their prevalence is rising, setting the stage for
an impending public health crisis that we do not yet understand and are not prepared to face. Many
autoimmune diseases disproportionately affect women and those with skin of color, potentially worsening
existing health disparities within our population. We must define the mechanisms that drive this growing
risk for autoimmunity so that we can better manage, or even prevent, a scourge of severe morbidity
and mortality. Skin diseases are among the most prevalent autoimmune diseases and are simple to study
due to the ability to diagnose and track the progression of disease through direct observation and sampling
using minimally invasive tools. Thus, skin diseases provide unique insight into mechanisms of autoimmunity
that are difficult to determine when studying other organs and tissues.
We will leverage a multidisciplinary team of investigators, cutting edge tools designed for at-home, longitudinal
tissue sampling, and an innovative strategy to discover how autoimmunity begins, relapses, and spreads in a
large population of at-risk individuals. We and others have determined that unaffected, non-lesional skin from
patients with autoimmunity exists in a disease-specific “preclinical” state, but whether this predisposes the
patient to develop disease is an open question. We hypothesize that a molecular immune signature drives
a preclinical state within the skin that predisposes to disease initiation and advancement of
autoimmunity to other organs. To test this, we will use two ideally suited models of autoimmunity. To predict
development of autoimmunity de novo as well as disease relapse, we will take advantage of the unique
properties of vitiligo: a strong genetic component, early age of onset (majority <30 years old), strong
association with other autoimmune diseases, high prevalence (>1%), and rapid relapse after stopping therapy.
We will longitudinally monitor 200 individuals with vitiligo for disease relapse and 800 of their relatives who are
“at-risk” for developing new onset disease. To predict the “progression” of autoimmunity to other organs we will
monitor a cohort of patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE): up to 20% of patients who initially
exhibit skin-limited lupus eventually develop systemic disease, with a median time to progression of two years.
We will monitor 50 subjects with CLE to detect disease progression to internal organs.
We will use these innovative tools on a large scale through “population multiomics” to define immune
drivers of autoimmunity in patients and their family members over time. To test our hypothesis, we will
use computational integration of clinical, genetic, and molecular data points to define a “preclinical
signature” of autoimmunity and use it to predict disease initiation and systemic progression. This
approach will provide insight into autoimmunity that will help physicians better manage, or even prevent,
devastating consequences of these diseases in the future."

 Infection with Chlamydia trachomatis is responsible for significant morbidity and healthcare costs
throughout the world. Work from our lab has demonstrated that T cells are a key mediator of immune
protection against C. trachomatis. Our long-term goal has been to gain an understanding of how CD8+ T cells
are stimulated in response to C. trachomatis infection. The reagents we have developed have allowed us to
use contemporary approaches in cellular immunology to define how Chlamydia-specific T cells respond to
infection. We have shown that transfer of cultured Chlamydia-specific CD8+ T cells into mice can protect
against infection, yet surprisingly, a protective CD8+ T cell memory response is not stimulated following natural
infection of mice or people. The apparent failure of the adaptive immune system to effectively clear the
organism and/or prevent repeat infection is a hallmark of human infection with C. trachomatis, resulting in
sequelae of infection such as permanent reproductive tract damage. Consistent with these findings in humans,
we have observed that CD8+ T cells respond extremely well to primary infection, yet the memory cells that
result from initial infection have impaired recall during subsequent encounters with the organism.
 Here, our goal is to 1) understand the mechanism by which CD8+ T memory is inhibited during infection
and develop methods to overcome it, and 2) identify vaccine formulations that stimulate protective CD8+ T cells
and test their capacity to enhance vaccine-mediated CD4+ T cell immunity. The vaccine strategies we will use
build on a successful experimental approach using nanoparticles encapsulating an adjuvant and bound to
whole inactivated organisms. Ultimately, we anticipate this work will drive selection of appropriate strategies
for vaccine development that provide robust protection against C. trachomatis."

This supplement proposal will provide a critical and timely opportunity to take advantage of the wide expertise,
diverse experimental systems, substantial emerging datasets, and novel impactful findings made by the FunGen-
AD consortium. It will support one part of a multi-group collaborative project across the consortium that was not
envisioned when the individual grant applications were made but has emerged through information and data
sharing within the consortium as each individual project has progressed. The FunGen-AD external advisory
board (EAB) has recognized the value and is fully supportive of this collaboration within the consortium.
 Substantial emerging data support the critical role of the endolysosomal pathway (ELP) and its role in
lipid homeostasis (LH) in the development and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Studies in human brains
have highlighted changes in the ELP and LH among the first changes in AD, suggesting that these functionally
integrated pathways might provide a target for early intervention. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of
AD have already highlighted several strong candidate risk genes that are central to ELP/LH, including APOE,
SORL1, and BIN1. Over the course of the functional analyses conducted within the FunGen-AD consortium, the
role of other known AD-relevant genes, including PICALM, LRP1, and CD2AP have underscored the importance
of the ELP/LH pathway. Studies to date indicate that we need to identify more genes implicated in the ELP/LH
and their impact on different neural cell types. The results could be transformative in the search for viable targets
to combat AD. The ELP/LH systems play critical yet distinct cell type-specific roles in the brain. Hence, a single
variant can disrupt ELP/LH in neurons, glial, and vascular cells in different ways. In Aim 1, we will conduct a
CRISPRi screen of c.1,000 candidate AD-risk genes in individual human iPSC-derived cell types: neurons,
astrocytes, microglia, vascular endothelial cells (ECs), and pericytes. This will comprehensively identify risk
genes important for ELP/LH in each major neural cell type. The data will be integrated with that from other
collaborating groups, prioritizing genes for additional screens and in-depth functional analyses. Our group is
particularly focused on the role of AD risk genes in vascular pathology, which is a prevalent early contributor to
AD. Effective ELP/LH function is essential to maintain vascular health, blood brain barrier integrity, and regulating
vascular inflammatory status, thus maintaining neural cell health and function. Hence, in Aim 2, we will examine
a prioritized subset of ELP/LH genes in the context of vascular ECs. We will perform in-depth characterization
of functional outcomes following knockdown of ELP/LH hits in iPSC-derived 2D vascular and 3D neurovascular
models. The CRISPR screen and characterization data will be aligned with and inform collaborative studies of
the ELP/LH across FunGen-AD groups. Through this collaboration we will gain an in-depth understanding of the
genes involved in ELP/LH function, how they act in individual neural cell types, and how the pathway can be
manipulated and effectively targeted for therapy development."

Biomedical knowledgebases are faced with the challenge of sustaining high-quality curation in the face of ever
increasing amounts of biomedical data and limited curator resources. These resources have successfully taken
advantage of natural language processing (NLP) technologies to automate some curation tasks, such as
document triage; however, other tasks such as free-text annotation and information extraction still require
intensive manual effort that causes bottlenecks in curation workflows. The advent of Large Language Models
(LLMs), which have demonstrated impressive performance in interpretation and production of natural
language, opens up the possibility of automating these time-consuming tasks, so as to maximize the value of
curator effort. Discussions at the recent NIH data repository and knowledgebase (DRKB) program meeting in
February 2024 showcased the great interest among resources in using LLMs to scale up curation. In this
supplement application, the Clinical Interpretation of Variants in Cancer (CIViC) resource and UniProt will
collaborate to develop AI-driven data curation strategies to benefit our resources and to serve as a model for
other DRKB members. CIViC is dedicated to the expert curation of information about the clinical significance of
cancer genome alterations to enable precision medicine. To support CIViC curation, we have previously
developed a BERT-based NLP system that extracts relationships between genes, genetic variants, cancers,
and drugs from sentences in the scientific articles. In Aim 1 of this project, we will enhance this tool in two
ways. First, we will add functionality that will classify sentences according to CIViC evidence types for somatic
variants: predictive, diagnostic, prognostic, oncogenic, and functional. Second, we will use an LLM to verify the
information extracted by the BERT-based tool. Relations that are supported by both methodologies will be
scored as high confidence, necessitating less manual curator review. In Aim 2, we will use an LLM to prepare
drafts of CIViC evidence statements, which are free-text descriptions of the literature evidence supporting
asserted relations. To increase the accuracy and relevance of the statements, we will provide sentences
identified by the BERT-based tool as enhanced context to the LLM. Supplementing an LLM with
domain-specific information, an approach known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), has been shown
to improve LLM performance on biomedical tasks. Finally, in Aim 3, we will disseminate the results from Aims 1
and 2 via the Hypothes.is community annotation platform, which is used by curators at CIViC and also at
ClinGen, an NIH-funded resource focusing on the clinical relevance of genes and genetic variants. Moreover,
UniProt will import CIViC relations and Evidence Statements for display in its computationally mapped
bibliography and will establish cross-links with CIViC. The prototype framework developed here is
generalizable to other biomedical knowledge domains and can be adopted by other data resources."

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system affecting nearly one
million individuals in the United States. The disease is characterized by acute and chronic inflammation, myelin
loss; oligodendrocyte, neuronal and axonal pathology; and progressive neurological dysfunction. A number of
breakthrough translational discoveries, and especially the highly beneficial effects of B cell depleting drugs, have
set the stage for a growing, yet still imperfect, therapeutic pipeline. Research will fall short of its potential to
improve patient outcomes until the trigger(s) of disease onset and modifiers of progression are identified.
Central to this project is the hypothesis that B cells presenting in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral
blood during early MS play key roles in triggering MS and in mediating ongoing progressive disease activity. We
propose to interrogate unique patient cohorts, including an incident cohort, with novel enabling technologies to
identify triggers of MS and modifiers of the clinical course. Well characterized clinical populations followed
longitudinally over time, high-field serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), genetic information organized as
functional operational networks, and a focus on B cell biology are the central elements of this initiative. A primary
goal will be to characterize the molecular diversity of B cells and their receptors at various stages of disease to
identify pathogenic populations and their antigenic targets.
A multi-layered experimental strategy includes single cell B cell transcriptomics, together with comprehensive
phage-displayed synthetic human, viral and microbial peptidomes for the screening of antibody fingerprints
against external drivers in the serum, CSF, and recombinant antibody libraries. The integrative analysis will
contextualize the data using clinical, MRI and genetic determinants, striving to apply rigorous statistical
principles, including independent replication."

 Astrocytes couple into networks of hundreds of cells. Impaired astrocyte coupling is associated with
epilepsy, but there is no consensus on whether reduced coupling promotes or counteracts abnormal neuronal
activity, which precedes seizures. A lack of astrocyte coupling can promote seizures;1 yet, the opposite has also
been shown: abnormal neuronal activity and seizures were reduced after coupling was inhibited1-3. An
integrated view that accounts for both findings is needed to reveal how astrocyte coupling modulates epilepsy.
In acquired epilepsy, which is initiated by a neurological insult such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), many
studies have demonstrated dysfunction of gap junctions (GJs) and dysregulation of Connexin43 (Cx43). Cx43
forms GJ responsible for astrocyte coupling leading to the conclusion that reduced coupling may contribute to
seizures. Studies in Cx43 knockout mice suggest that the timing and duration of reduced astrocyte coupling may
determine if abnormal neuronal activity is promoted or counteracted. This has not been tested due to a lack of
tools that dynamically modulate coupling. To reduce or restore astrocyte coupling dynamically, we generated
viral constructs that can be induced to express functional or mutated Cx43 for variable durations at different
stages of acquired epilepsy. These Cx43 mutants inhibited astrocyte coupling and induced neuronal
hyperexcitability in vivo. To assess the relationship between astrocyte coupling and neuronal activity, we will
use a model of acquired epilepsy that progresses to spontaneous seizures after mild TBI in the absence of many
confounding factors5. This model recapitulates three key aspects of Cx43 pathology: astrocyte coupling is
reduced, Cx43 protein is increased and increased phosphorylation at Cx43 serine 368. This post-translational
modification alters GJ conductivity, and is associated with internalization of GJ. Yet, the critical upstream
signaling causing reduced astrocyte coupling and its effects on neuronal activity during different stages of
acquired epilepsy must be revealed as a foundation for future therapeutic targeting. This proposal will generate
an integrated model of astrocyte coupling modulation in acquired epilepsy that aims to unify previous findings.
Cx43 function will be dynamically manipulated to 1) determine if the timing of reduced astrocyte coupling
modulates abnormal neuronal activity 2) identify the signaling cascade controlling reduced astrocyte coupling
and 3) determine if and when restoring astrocyte coupling prevents acquired epilepsy. Acquired epilepsy affects
65 million people worldwide and is notoriously difficult to treat. Even after decades of research and the
development of new anti-epileptic drugs targeting neurons, one third of patients still suffer from drug-resistant
epilepsy. Targeting astrocytic Cx43 might be an option, but the first step towards therapy is determining when
reduced coupling is adaptive and when it is maladaptive."

Dance movement is a form of physical activity that may benefit the brain as much or more than structured
aerobic exercise. Despite the potential of dance as an intervention to promote neurocognitive health, gaps in
knowledge about essential intervention components are a barrier to definitive trials, specifically:1) a lack of
specificity on key prescription parameters including how many times a week dance classes should be taught,
2) need for better estimates of how large an effect dance has on fitness and the brain, and 3) little
understanding of the expected time course for change in fitness and the brain in response to dance. The
primary aim of this proposal is to test whether weekly dance frequency differentially modifies key outcomes,
and from this to test effect sizes to determine sufficient sample sizes for a larger-scale trial. Physical activity
promoting interventions tested in older adults have traditionally focused on exercise, i.e., structured physical
activity of at least moderate intensity with the express purpose of improving health or fitness. However, in
2003, epidemiological evidence showed that social dance was the only leisure time physical activity associated
with lower Alzheimer’s disease risk. Since then, multiple smaller studies have shown benefits of dance
movement and dance therapy on mobility and neurocognitive health in older adults, including cardiorespiratory
fitness, balance, white matter health, and cognition. Dance movement inherently involves simultaneous
cognitive stimulation through motor learning and dual-tasking; social interactions; aerobic physical activity that
elevates heart rate and improves cardiorespiratory fitness; and improves balance and reduces fall risk. Dance
also satisfies key antecedents of lasting behavior change outlined in contemporary behavioral theories
including self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, autonomy, and relatedness. Dance is also culturally relevant and
has been practiced spontaneously for thousands of years. This means dance may result in better long-term
adherence than more commonly studied forms of aerobic exercise like brisk walking, where data from our
group and others shows that adherence drops significantly after intervention ends. This proposal plans to
assess outcomes of 1x/weekly, 2x/weekly, and 3x/weekly dance movement classes and 1x/week music
appreciation class control at 4 time-points over 6 months to determine the time course of changes in
cardiorespiratory fitness, cognition, and key secondary outcomes in 160 adults ≥ 65 years old at risk for
Alzheimer’s disease due to subjective cognitive decline. 1x/weekly is common for community classes and has
been tested in multiple dance studies; 2x/weekly is most common in dance research; and 3x/weekly is most
common for aerobic exercise interventions like treadmill walking that target CRF. We aim to determine the
optimal frequency of dance movement intervention for a Phase III trial that will effect change in relevant
outcomes while maintaining attendance."

The long-term goal of this project is to understand the pathological mechanisms of sulfur mustard gas
keratopathy (MGK) in the cornea. Sulfur mustard (SM) is an alkylating agent that has been used as a chemical
warfare agent. SM exposure to the eye results in acute corneal injury. A subset of patients, particularly those
with high exposure levels, develop chronic or delayed symptoms, which is known as MGK. Thus far, there are
no specific treatments available to stop or reverse the detrimental effects of MGK. One of reasons for the lack
of a specific treatment is that the mechanisms of MGK are not fully understood. Autophagy is a process by
which cells break down and recycle their own cellular components, including damaged proteins and organelles.
Even though autophagy has been recognized as a fundamental cellular process against stress, autophagy can
play beneficial or detrimental roles depending on the context. In the cornea, it has been demonstrated that in
response to most of stresses, autophagy plays beneficial roles to protect tissue homeostasis. Our laboratory
and many other investigators have been focusing on such protective roles of autophagy in the cornea.
However, the detrimental role of autophagy in the cornea has not been studied. Interestingly, when we
investigated the role of autophagy in corneal injury due to chemical exposure, we found that nitrogen mustard
(NM), an analog of sulfur mustard, induced a unique autophagy, which plays a harmful role in the cornea. It
has been shown that the liberation of Beclin1, a key regulator in induction of autophagy, from Beclin1-Bcl2
complex can induce autophagy. Our preliminary data suggest that after NM exposure, sequestration of Beclin1
in Beclin1-Bcl2 complex attenuates NM-induced corneal inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesize that corneal
mustard exposure induces autophagy via liberating Beclin1 from Beclin1-Bcl2 complex and such induced
autophagy promotes corneal inflammation and contributes to MGK. In Aim 1, we will explore: (i) whether NM
exposure will affect Beclin1-Bcl2 binding in vitro and in vivo; and (ii) whether manipulation of Beclin1-Bcl2
binding will affect NM-induced autophagy in cornea. In Aim 2, we will capitalize on our ability to conduct gain-
and loss-of-function studies of induced autophagy in mice. We will inhibit induced autophagy via either
reducing Beclin1 expression or preventing the disassociation of Beclin1-Bcl2 complex in vivo. We will also
enhance induced autophagy via preventing the binding of Beclin1 and Bcl2 in vivo. We will utilize these
genetically modified mouse models to determine whether the detrimental effects of NM exposure in cornea will
be: (i) attenuated by inhibition of induced autophagy, while (ii) increased by enhancement of induced
autophagy. Knowledge from this project will reveal the pathological importance of induced autophagy in
corneal MGK and will form the foundation for the development of novel therapies for this disease by targeting
this Beclin1-Bcl2 complex-regulated autophagy pathway."
11123566,"Project Summary/Abstract
Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent responsible for the most severe form of human malaria, a
disease that kills more than 400,000 people a year, mostly young children in Africa. These protozoan
parasites invade and ultimately destroy circulating red blood cells (RBCs) of their host, leading to severe
anemia and the frequently lethal syndromes of cerebral malaria and pregnancy associated malaria. Over
the course of an infection, small sub-populations of parasites arise that have an altered antigenic
phenotype, thus avoiding the antibody response of the host. This process is referred to as antigenic
variation and is responsible for the persistent nature of the disease as well as the waves of parasitemia
frequently observed in P. falciparum infections. Antigenic variation of P. falciparum infected RBCs results
from switches in expression between individual members of the multi-copy var gene family. Each var gene
encodes a different form of a protein called PfEMP1. This protein is placed on the infected RBC surface
and mediates adhesion to specific receptors found on the endothelial surfaces of the blood vessel walls of
the infected individual. This adhesion is responsible for many of the disease manifestations of infection
with P. falciparum, including both cerebral malaria and pregnancy associated malaria. Only a single var
gene is expressed at a time by any given parasite, thus determining both the antigenic phenotype of the
infected cells as well as their adhesive properties. Therefore var gene expression is at the heart of both
antigenic variation and virulence of malaria infections. The long-term objectives of this project are to
understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate var gene expression and antigenic variation by
malaria parasites. Significant work in recent years has defined many molecular aspects that maintain a
gene in the active or silent state, however the mechanisms governing switching between transcriptionally
active genes remain entirely undefined. Moreover, given that an infection can include billions of individual
parasites, how they seemingly coordinate switching events to limit activation to a single or small number of
genes at a time is completely unexplored. In contrast, uncoordinated, random switching would rapidly
exhaust the entire var repertoire. There is no evidence of communication between parasites, and there
does not appear to be a strict switching order within the var gene family, therefore how this is
accomplished remains completely mysterious. The specific aims of the project are designed to decipher
the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon. Aim 1 investigates the role of an unusual, highly conserved var
gene that appears to function as central organizing gene that coordinates switching events. Aim 2 will
determine how parasites sense the presence of a placenta and alter var gene expression to take
advantage of this unusual niche. This project will contribute to the ongoing effort to disrupt the process of
antigenic variation and thereby shorten the length of an infection and reduce its severity."

provided research training to 221 Fogarty Global Health Fellows and Scholars, who to date have generated
866 publications. With this competitive renewal, we propose to expand training activities aimed at increasing
the likelihood of trainees becoming independent global health scientists and leaders. We have modified our

12-month research and leadership training with the following specific aims: Aim 1: To ensure excellence in
scientific inquiry, trainees will complete a comprehensive curriculum in global health research, including how to
frame novel, relevant, and feasible scientific questions, prepare detailed scientific protocols, and plan for the
implementation of a mentored research project in a low- or middle-income country. Aim 2: To address the
challenges of research implementation in a low-resource setting, trainees will follow an explicit, expedited,
supported, and mentored progression from research planning to pragmatic implementation and process
management. Aim 3: To prepare trainees for careers as independent scientists and to excel in both leadership
and management, we will support trainees in development of individualized “road maps” to define the research,
management and leadership skills necessary for their transition into independent investigators. We will also
expand alumni support for alumni to further strengthen the scientific and leadership skills necessary for
transitioning to the next generation of independent global health scientists. The four U.S. universities, as well
as Indiana University - an associated partner since 2016 - have committed cost-sharing funds totaling
$565,000 to increase recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities and a second year of fellowship
for the most productive fellows. We anticipate supporting at least 10 trainees each year, for a total of 50
trainees over the five year grant period; 60% of trainees will be at the U.S. postdoctoral level and 40% will

11125252,"Project 1 Supplement Summary: Virulence Gene Discovery in Coccidioides
 The focus of Project 1 is virulence gene discovery in Coccidioides. Despite the impact of Coccidioides
infection, the molecular understanding of virulence mechanisms in this fungus is limited. Only a handful of
Coccidioides genes have been implicated any virulence-relevant traits. Given the need to accelerate drug
discovery and resolve the public health crisis posed by this fungus in the endemic areas, it is imperative to dissect
virulence strategies used by Coccidioides to manipulate the host. Here we apply powerful systems-level tools to
identify virulence-relevant genes. Such a landmark discovery effort will help open up the field at long last,
providing a rich source of virulence genes to serve as new therapeutic targets.
 The ability of Coccidioides to cause disease depends on an elaborate developmental transition from
saprophytic soil form to host form. Specifically, the hyphal form of the organism produces arthroconidia, which
disperse easily and can be inhaled by mammalian hosts. Once inside the host lung, arthroconidia germinate,
enlarge, and undergo nuclear division and segmentation to form large spherules filled with vegetative
endospores. Rupture of the spherules allows release of endospores and dissemination of the fungus to other
sites. Given the critical role of spherule development in disease progression, a major focus of this project is the
genomic and genetic dissection of this process. We will identify candidate genes that govern spherulation by a
combination of molecular approaches. We are disrupting these candidate genes and assessing their roles in
spherulation. Our Coccidioides knockout workflow requires more personnel time per strain than we had allocated
in the parent award. To meet this demand, we request support for salary to add an additional Coccidioides
molecular geneticist to contribute to knockout construction and phenotyping under the current supplement. We
do not propose a change in the scope of the grant."
11122728,"Project Summary/Abstract
Genomic medicine and U.S. healthcare have reached an inflection point, where the next wave of innovative
technologies may alleviate or exacerbate existing health inequity. There are multiple ethical, legal and social
implications (ELSI) of transitioning from precision diagnosis to preventive treatments for genetic disease in a
societal context of significant scientific uncertainty and inequitable healthcare access. The implementation and
ELSI research oversight of fetal gene therapy – until now a hypothetical exercise – will profoundly shape
whether the NHGRI 2030 strategic vision for improved community stakeholder engagements and equitable
genomic medicine can be realized. The proposed K99/R00 Award presents a significant opportunity to
incorporate ELSI knowledge into the pioneering processes of fetal gene therapy by investigating three distinct
levels of ethical concern for emergent fetal gene therapy: clinical, regulatory and societal. Through
interdisciplinary training, mentorship, and collaborations with the University of California, San Francisco Center
for Maternal-Fetal Precision Medicine (CMFPM), the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics (SCBE) and the
UCSF-Stanford Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (CERSI), this project pursues an
ethnographic and “embedded ethics” approach to fetal gene therapy at a critical juncture in preventive
precision medicine and ELSI research. This multi-sited study on the ELSI of fetal gene therapy will connect
what happens in the clinic, and its regulatory infrastructures, with the larger-scale societal values that will need
to be incorporated to achieve greater social inclusion. The proposed five-year training and research program
prepares the candidate for independent ELSI scholarship in the field of preventive genomic medicine, by
harnessing ethnographic skills to complement a K99 acquired education in human genetics and genomics,
bioethics and community engagement methods. Three barriers to social inclusion are identified: 1) tensions
between clinical and social utility; 2) a lack of empirical data on decision-making processes given uncertainty;
and 3) equitable stakeholder engagements. These problems inform three specific aims of this proposal: 1) to
describe the processes that inform decisions about fetal gene therapy and its ‘utility,’ according to clinicians
and patients who are directly involved in the most promising fetal gene and molecular therapies at CMFPM
(K99); 2) to document how uncertainty is managed in the clinic and explore how this is shaped by social values
and socioeconomic supports (K99); and 3) to account for diverse, non-patient community views and the extent
to which fetal gene therapy developments are or are not socially inclusive (R00). Education and research to
fulfill these aims will advance understanding about the scientific, regulatory, clinical, patient, and societal
values that drive fetal gene therapy innovations. With unique ethnographic access to the clinical frontier of fetal
gene therapy, it will provide an understanding of the importance of social inclusion during the process of
knowledge translation, decision-making, and value-making."
11126295,"Project Summary / Abstract
Natural products continue to provide important drug leads in medicine. While the majority of clinical
antibiotics are derived from bacterial natural products, the emergence of antibiotic resistance emphasizes
the need to discover new antimicrobial leads. This renewal application builds upon a productive
collaboration between the Jensen (microbiology/bioinformatics) and Moore (biosynthesis/natural
products chemistry) laboratories to address this need through the mining of microbial genomes and
metagenomes for new bioactive compounds. We have prioritized two diverse groups of chemically gifted
marine bacteria for study from a collection of >10,000 strains collected across the world’s oceans. We
continue our efforts with the obligate marine actinomycete Salinispora, which produces the potent
proteasome inhibitor salinosporamide A (Marizomib) that is presently in phase III trials to treat brain
cancer. Here we capitalize on the recent identification of six new Salinispora species and 99 new
genomes to expand our efforts in this unique taxon. We further expand our genome mining efforts to
include the MAR4 lineage, a second chemically gifted group of marine bacteria for which we are uniquely
situated to explore with 42 new genomes. This lineage shows the first evidence that marine adaptations
are linked to natural product biosynthesis and includes at least six new species. We have identified
hundreds of orphan biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in these two groups and prioritized them as lead
discovery targets. We have further taken this program into new directions by mining BGCs directly from
environmental DNA (eDNA) using a nontargeted metagenomic approach that provides unbiased access
to the biosynthetic potential of microbial diversity. These samples originate from both shallow tropical
ocean sediments (1515 natural product BGCs already assembled) as well as deep sea sediments (down
to 2000 meters) that are being collected for this program and have yet to be explored for natural products
research. We will maximize access to these unique resources and employ innovative techniques in
genome mining and synthetic biology to prioritize the targeted discovery of new antibiotic leads such as
beta-lactone-containing products from eDNA that are predicted to inhibit protease virulence factors in
Gram(-) bacteria. These genome mining efforts are governed by a logical workflow that prioritizes novel
antibiotic discovery from poorly explored microbial resources."
11126342,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Approximately 10% of all infants are born prematurely, and up to 50% of preterm infants experience
neurodevelopmental delays/disorders. Prematurity is associated with smaller brain regions that are correlated
with lower developmental scores. Moreover, up to 75% preterm infants experience systemic inflammation that
is also associated with lower developmental scores and brain white matter injury. In contrast, human milk (HM)
feeding is associated with better neurodevelopment in both term and preterm infants. Current literature suggests
both prematurity and neonatal inflammation may contribute to neurodevelopmental hindrance. This study will be
the first to examine the molecular mechanisms of how HM affects the gut-brain axis (intestinal, systemic, and
brain inflammation) and to validate relevant human biomarkers for clinical use. There is a critical need to
determine how HM improves neurocognitive outcomes to inform clinical practice guidelines.
The long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind how HM improves neurodevelopment in
preterm infants. The overall objective is to determine the effects of different early-life feedings on intestinal barrier
function; intestinal, systemic, and brain inflammation; and neurocognitive development using the high homology
neonatal piglet model and validate relevant non-invasive human biomarkers. The central hypothesis is that
early HM feeding preserves intestinal barrier function and reduces intestinal, systemic, and brain inflammation
thus improving neurocognitive development. The approach will use a clinically relevant piglet model to 1)
compare intestinal growth, inflammation, and barrier function between HM and infant formula (IF) feedings; 2)
assess systemic inflammatory differences between feeding groups; and 3) determine neurocognitive function,
brain growth, and neuroinflammation as a function of the feeding groups.
This research is innovative because it will be the first study to combine functional, histological, and molecular
methods to directly examine the complex mechanisms of how different feeding regimens affect interrelationships
between the intestinal, systemic, and neurological systems in relation to neurodevelopment without the common
confounding factors in human observational studies. Further, this research will validate non-invasive human
biomarkers to enhance research translation. The expectation is to determine the direct effects of HM and IF
feedings at the intestinal, systemic, and brain levels, and whether these feedings modify intestinal barrier
function, immune tissue development, and neurodevelopment. The critical knowledge gained from this study will
positively impact the field by directing subsequent research and shaping clinical practice guidelines with evidence
to optimize early feeding that may significantly impact the infant’s ability to: 1) fight systemic inflammation, and
2) mitigate long-term neurodevelopmental deficits. The results from this proposed research will also provide
useful non-invasive biomarkers to help monitor developmental and inflammatory status of the infants while
modifying feeding mixtures to ensure achievement of optimal developmental outcomes."

This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as “NOT-CA-
24-044.” In recent years, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) such as the HER2 ADC trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-
DXd) have emerged as a powerful therapeutic strategy across solid tumors, with dozens of new ADCs in
development. Thus, we have strong interest in developing ADCs as a therapeutic strategy for uterine serous
carcinoma (USC), in line with our long-term goal to optimize biomarker-driven therapy in gynecologic diseases.
To this end, we propose two specific aims: Aim 1. To determine the expression pattern of emerging ADC targets,
using a tissue microarray of 100 endometrial cancers containing at least 50 USCs. We will perform
immunostaining for emerging ADC targets using well-established assays, several of which are already deployed
in the CLIA environment. We hypothesize that many ADC targets are expressed in USC, and better
understanding of the relative expression pattern in USC may seed better therapeutic trials. Aim 2. To determine
the antitumor activity of T-DXd or datopotamab deruxtecan (Dato-DXd), alone and in combination with the WEE1
inhibitor azenosertib in vitro and in vivo, using well-characterized models of USC. We hypothesize that USC will
be sensitive to many ADCs such as T-DXd and Dato-DXd, and that azenosertib may enhance their efficacy,
based on preliminary work that WEE1 inhibition can enhance activity of T-DXd. Of note, the WEE1 inhibitors
adovasertib and azenosertib have shown intriguing activity in USC, with molecular alterations such as TP53
mutation status thought to contribute to increase sensitivity. Taken together, we will demonstrate the frequency
of expression of different ADC targets and their overlap in USC. We will also test whether we can enhance the
activity of T-DXd and Dato-DXd with WEE1 inhibitor combinations. If so, this work will provide preliminary data
not only for planning of clinical trials with T-DXd and azenosertib, but will also allow us to pursue the same
combination strategy using other ADCs with topoisomerase payloads."

11124474,"ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) susceptibility loci are enriched for genes implicated in the endolysosomal pathway
(ELP) and lipid homeostasis (LH), and these biological processes are highly interdependent. The AD Sequencing
Project (ADSP) Functional Genomics Consortium (FunGen) selected the ELP/LH pathways as high-priorities for
cross-cutting, collaborative investigations, culminating in 3 applications for supplemental funding. Together,
investigators from 4 distinct U01 FunGen projects will probe ELP/LH mechanisms of AD risk using a tiered
strategy integrating experiments in Drosophila with both 2D and 3D human iPSC cultures. We recently showed
that APOE and several other AD susceptibility / ELP genes (PICALM, CD2AP, AP2A2) participate in a common
pathway involving the formation of lipid droplets (LD) within glia. Glial LD formation involves two related
mechanisms. The first is a non-cell autonomous neuroprotective pathway where LD form within glia in response
to elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neurons. These glial LDs are composed of toxic, peroxidated lipids
(LPO) produced by “stressed” neurons and these LPO are catabolized within the glia, effectively removing the
LPO from the brain and protecting both cell types from ROS-induced damage. The second mechanism involving
glial LD formation is a cell autonomous mechanism whereby APOE4 or loss of PICALM directly drives glial LD
formation in response to stress. This causes high LD load and may be important in later-stage AD pathologic
changes. We hypothesize that many other AD risk genes may participate in either one or both of these pathways,
having divergent impact on AD risk, glial LD load, and neuronal oxidative stress/injury, depending on the disease
stage(s) and cell type(s) affected. Here, we propose systematic functional dissection of 50 AD candidate genes,
using well-established Drosophila protocols to establish cell-type specific requirements for glial LD formation,
potential interactions with ROS, and resulting neurodegeneration. Gene selection will be closely coordinated with
FunGen collaborators and informed by complementary, high-throughput screens considering more than 1000
genes in iPSC and Drosophila models, revealing interactions with amyloid-beta / tau-induced neurodegeneration
and requirements for ELP/LH. Overall, our integrated FunGen supplemental research program will promote
highly synergistic studies not otherwise possible within the scope of individual projects, revealing ELP/LH
mechanisms of AD risk, identifying promising therapeutic targets, and culminating in a joint consortium
manuscript."

The objective of our LAUNCH program is to continue our global health research training program called the
Global Health Equity Scholars (GHES) designed to create a new community of researchers, educators, and
professionals who are prepared to address new and emerging global health challenges. We will build on the last
nine years of this training program to create a cadre of new researchers who will dedicate their research careers
to address the health problems that arise out of the inequity of human conditions prevalent in informal human
settlements (also referred to as slums). Rather than addressing one disease at a time, we propose to provide a
comprehensive, multidisciplinary, and integrated approach to deal with urban and rural informal human
settlement health issues, developed over many years by the participating faculty members of this program. This
program will comprise four US partner institutions (Consortium) - Yale University, Stanford University, University
of Arizona, and University of California at Berkeley, each led by a leader in global health research with more
than 10 years of collaboration among themselves. Together, core faculty mentors from these institutions conduct
research at 25 institutions in 21 countries, representing regions of Africa, Central and South America, the
Caribbean, Asia, the Pacific, and Eastern Europe. The GHES program will address a wide range of health
research topics including HIV/AIDs, emerging and high- consequence infectious diseases, non-communicable
diseases (NCD), women's health, environmental health, mental health, interpersonal violence, substance abuse,
injuries, and the interaction of all of these health issues within the framework of slum health. Training will target
US postdoctoral fellows and pre-doctoral students and low and middle-income country (LMIC) postdoctoral
fellows. We plan to recruit 9-10 trainees/year with 60% of them as US postdoctoral fellows. The trainees will
spend 8-12-months at an LMIC site under the supervision of the Consortium and their collaborating LMIC
mentors. Workshops on global health research methods, skill development and career development will be
conducted both in-person and online. LMIC trainees will spend 2-3 months at US institutions to undergo training
in methods not provided at their institutions. All of the trainees will be provided with research and career
mentorship throughout their training and tracked for career development after completion of their GHES-
supported research work. Thus, under this program, we expect the trainees to be exposed to one important
theme in global health research--health equity--through research that deals with health concerns of vulnerable
populations residing in informal human settlements and provide them with an opportunity to become experts in
this new global health discipline. The overall impact of this training program is, therefore, to create a new cadre
of global health researchers and leaders who address the emerging health issues arising out of ever-expanding
informal human settlements of LMICs."
11126915,"The size of the aging population is reaching record levels worldwide, causing a parallel increase in the number of individuals with cognitive impairment and dementia, including Alzheimer’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease- Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). Multiple factors predispose individuals to the development of cognitive impairment and dementia, including obesity, the metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, and diabetes, whose rates are also growing worldwide. With few to no available treatments, research is critical to understand the mechanisms by which these metabolic dysfunctions promote cognitive impairment and AD/ADRD with aging, especially during early phases of metabolic imbalance, such as in midlife obesity and in prediabetes before progression to frank diabetes. Inflammation is a common denominator across aging, obesity, prediabetes, diabetes, and cognitive impairment, including in AD/ADRD. Inflammatory mechanisms may play a particularly important role by promoting early or increased inflammaging, a chronic low-grade inflammation. One particular innate inflammatory mechanism that may be contributing to inflammaging is the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sensing cGAS/STING pathway. cGAS/STING is dysregulated in peripheral tissues in obesity, the metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, and diabetes. This pathway responds to cytosolic dsDNA from bacteria or viruses or released as a result of nuclear or mitochondrial stress and upregulates pro-inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesize that dyslipidemia and insulin resistance during the progression of obesity and prediabetes trigger inflammatory pathways, including cGAS/STING, that exacerbate and transmit inflammatory signals within the central nervous system (CNS). We also anticipate that as the primary immune cells of the CNS, microglia mediate this inflammatory transmission, in part via extracellular vesicle inflammatory crosstalk, further worsening neurologic and cognitive outcomes. We will test our hypothesis by: 1) establish the role of cGAS/STING and the inflammatory milieu during the progression of midlife to later life obesity- and prediabetes-induced cognitive impairment, 2) determine the role of microglial cGAS/STING in HFD-induced cognitive impairment in mid and later life, and 3) investigate extracellular vesicle mediated cGAS/STING inflammatory crosstalk mechanisms in the CNS in obesity- and prediabetes-induced cognitive impairment during aging. This study will establish how inflammation and the cGAS/STING pathway fluctuate during aging as obesity and prediabetes progress, and how they contribute to cognitive impairment that overtime leads to AD/ADRD. Additionally, the study will identify disease-modifying targets and, perhaps more importantly, ideal therapeutic windows for these potential therapies for early intervention and the prevention of AD/ADRD."
11126922,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The accumulation of DNA Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) in neurons is an early hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease
(AD). Increased DSBs are also associated with aging, which is the largest risk factor for AD. AD is also a complex
disease involving all major brain glial cell types. Thus, there is a critical need to understand the molecular
mechanisms of DSB induced changes in both neurons and glia. The structural stability of the genome is
paramount in maintaining a functional genome, and recently, the 3D organization of the genome has emerged
as a major regulator of genome function. My overall hypothesis is that 3D genome reorganization and structural
genome instability mediated by DSBs are principle drivers of AD pathogenesis and brain aging. My objective is
to determine how and to what extent DSBs within the neurons impact genome organization and the glial
response, with the goal of identifying molecular pathways that can be targeted as novel therapies for preventing
or halting the progression of neurodegeneration. I will use mouse models that recapitulate the pre-symptomatic
accumulation of DSBs in neurons and human iPSC models to determine the degree of the 3D genome disruption
caused due to DSBs and the underlying molecular mechanisms. I will also identify the consequences of neuronal
DSBs on the structural stability of the genome by measuring the frequency of DSB mediated chromosomal
translocations in human AD neurons. Interestingly, normal neuronal activity causes DSBs at immediate early
gene promoters. Also, neuronal hyperactivity has been reported in AD. I will test if IEGs are locations of frequent
chromosomal translocations after neuronal hyperactivity induced in neuronal culture.
 Previous studies have shown that microglia transitions to a reactive state in response to
neurodegeneration. To understand the role of the 3D genome organization in this microglia transition, I will use
single cell Hi-C to measure the unique chromatin interactions that mediate the reactive microglia state.
Subsequently, transcription factor predictions using integrative analysis of single cell Hi-C will be tested in iPSC
derived microglia-neuron co-cultures for their potential to modulate the reactive microglia response. This
approach will be extended to study oligodendrocyte response in the independent phase.
 I will work with my mentor Dr. Li-Huei Tsai, my mentorship committee, Dr. Bruce Yankner and Dr. Manolis
Kellis, my technical support and advisory committee, Dr. Frederick Alt and Dr. Peter Fraser to carry out my
proposed training plan. I will gain experience in iPSC technology and differentiation from the Tsai lab to modulate
the disease associated microglia response to neuronal DSBs and work with Dr. Manolis Kellis to implement the
computational pipelines for the transcription factor predictions. To bridge the gap in my training in the biology of
AD and brain aging, I will audit relevant courses and receive additional mentoring from Dr. Bruce Yankner."
11126926,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Social experiences shape the health and longevity of humans and other social mammals. Social adversity
in humans and in social nonhuman primates is associated with higher mortality and poorer health. One
prevailing explanation is that chronic stress dysregulates the physiological response to stress, resulting in a
chronic inflammatory phenotype that accelerates aging and is associated with chronic neurodegenerative
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. These inflammatory outcomes overlap with those influenced by diet. In
comparisons of two prevailing diets that differ in nutritional composition—the Western and Mediterranean
diets—Western diets are associated with not only poorer health and an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease
and other dementias, but also a chronic inflammatory phenotype. These characteristics raise the question of
how diet and social experiences interact to influence aging and health.
 The objective of the proposed study is to identify the molecular mechanisms that link social adversity and
diet to the stress response and inflammation. If the inflammatory outcomes of social adversity and diet share
some common molecular mechanisms, I hypothesize that the diet can mitigate age-accelerating phenotypes in
the brain by modulating neuroinflammatory responses to social adversity. To test this hypothesis, I will leverage
the advantages of studying female macaques, which are well-established animal models of human social
behavior, aging, and chronic disease. I propose a two-pronged approach that combines studies of free-ranging
macaques spanning the entire adult lifespan (Aim 1) with experimental manipulations of diet in a middle-aged
macaque cohort (Aims 2 and 3), thus yielding insights into the relationships between stress,
neuroinflammation, and aging in an integrated model. In both contexts, I will combine genome-wide gene
expression measurements to characterize the genomic pathways associated with social adversity and diet.
Insights gleaned from the free-ranging population (Aim 1) will be used to characterize how social adversity and
diet interact to influence neurodegeneration and brain aging (Aims 2-3), and to understand the role of key cell
types, including microglia (Aim 3).
 At its conclusion, this project will yield a detailed understanding of how social adversity and diet affect gene
regulation and neuroinflammation in the aging brain, and how diet interventions can buffer against the health
consequences of chronic social stress. Together, these results will advance our understanding of the
mechanisms through which diet or social adversity impact cognitive and neurological resilience in the aging
population. In addition, the proposed program of mentored training activities will allow me to develop a strong,
independent research career in aging, focused on the nexus of aging, social behavior, neuroscience, and
genomics."
11125179,"Over the past ten years, our consortium Universities in Hawaii, Michigan, Minnesota, and Washington have
provided research training to 221 Fogarty Global Health Fellows and Scholars, who to date have generated
866 publications. With this competitive renewal, we propose to expand training activities aimed at increasing
the likelihood of trainees becoming independent global health scientists and leaders. We have modified our
consortium name to reflect this new emphasis: Northern Pacific Global Health Leadership, Education, And
Development for Early-career Researchers (NPGH LEADERs). We propose to continue partnerships based in
nine countries: Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Cameroon, Liberia, Peru, Thailand, Nepal, and India. To achieve our
objective of developing the next generation of independent global health scientists and leaders, we will offer
12-month research and leadership training with the following specific aims: Aim 1: To ensure excellence in
scientific inquiry, trainees will complete a comprehensive curriculum in global health research, including how to
frame novel, relevant, and feasible scientific questions, prepare detailed scientific protocols, and plan for the
implementation of a mentored research project in a low- or middle-income country. Aim 2: To address the
challenges of research implementation in a low-resource setting, trainees will follow an explicit, expedited,
supported, and mentored progression from research planning to pragmatic implementation and process
management. Aim 3: To prepare trainees for careers as independent scientists and to excel in both leadership
and management, we will support trainees in development of individualized “road maps” to define the research,
management and leadership skills necessary for their transition into independent investigators. We will also
expand alumni support for alumni to further strengthen the scientific and leadership skills necessary for
transitioning to the next generation of independent global health scientists. The four U.S. universities, as well
as Indiana University - an associated partner since 2016 - have committed cost-sharing funds totaling
$565,000 to increase recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities and a second year of fellowship
for the most productive fellows. We anticipate supporting at least 10 trainees each year, for a total of 50
trainees over the five year grant period; 60% of trainees will be at the U.S. postdoctoral level and 40% will
implement HIV-related research projects."
11124992,"Eﬀects of semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro and Zepbound) on incidence and
outcomes of stimulant use disorders and opioid use disorder in real-world populations: target trial
emulation using patient electronic health records
ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a steady rise in the incidence and associated death of StUDs including methamphetamine use
disorder (MUD) and cocaine use disorder (CUD). Among people aged 12 or older in 2022, 0.6 percent (or
1.8 million people) had MUD and 0.5 percent (or 1.4 million people) had CUD in the past year. Currently,
there are no treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for StUDs and there is a
critical unmet need. Clinical anecdotes that patients treated with semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1
receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) approved for treating type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in 2017 and for weight
management in 2021 reported reduced desire to drink and smoke have attracted attention regarding its
potential to treat addiction. Currently, several registered clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the eﬀect
of semaglutide on alcohol consumption and smoking cessation. Preclinical studies have investigated the
eﬀects of semaglutide or other GLP1R agonists on nicotine, alcohol, or opioids. However, little attention
has been placed on the eﬀects of semaglutide on StUDs; the present project will help address this gap.
The proposed study would utilize TriNetX Analytics, a nationwide electronic health records (EHR)
database, to evaluate semaglutide’s association with changes in both the incidence of StUDs (MUD, CUD)
and clinical outcomes associated with StUDs. Outcomes will be separately assessed by age groups, sex,
and race and in patients with co-occurring mental disorders or other substance use disorders (SUDs)
including alcohol, nicotine, opioid, and cannabis use disorders, whenever sample sizes permit. Our
methodology is based on our successful use of TriNetX Analytics to evaluate semaglutide’s association
with reduced incidence and relapse of cannabis use disorder."
11126150,"SUMMARY
New variants, especially in non-coding regions, are expected to be discovered through the ongoing AD
Sequencing Project (ADSP). This proposal will investigate circular RNAs (circRNAs) and RNA binding
proteins (RBPs) that regulate or are regulated by these circRNAs. Recent genomic studies have
discovered thousands of circRNAs produced from both protein-coding genes and non-coding regions of
the genome via a process known as back-splicing. CircRNAs are more enriched in neuronal tissues and
are often derived from genes specific for neuronal and synaptic function. The discovery of these
circRNAs demands a coordinated investigation of RBPs that interact with the circRNAs. Mutations in and
dysfunction of RBPs are known to be major mechanisms contributing to the pathophysiology in
frontotemporal dementia, ALS and AD. However, the contributions of the circRNA:RBP network to these
disease mechanisms are largely unknown. The novel biology of circRNAs opens an entirely new window
into mechanisms of neurodegeneration in ADRD. CircRNAs could contribute to neurodegeneration by
acting as sponges that sequester miRNA/RBPs away from normal mRNA targets, altering splicing or
expression. RBPs also regulate circRNA production by binding to the flanking intronic sequences of
circRNAs which contain many conserved binding sites of splicing factors/RBPs. Thus, sequestration of
RBPs in protein aggregates could cause dysfunctional regulation of circRNAs. The history of genomics
indicate that discovery of each new nucleotide species expands our understanding of disease
mechanisms. The discovery of circRNA presents a major unexplored avenue of RNA metabolism that
demands investigation. We hypothesize that changes in the levels of circRNAs contributes to the
pathophysiology of ADRD, and that discovery of key circRNAs or circRNA-RBP interactions in
aging human brains could uncover novel biomarkers, disease mechanisms or therapeutic
targets. In this proposal, by leveraging large public and our own RNA-seq data (rRNA-depleted), we will
apply several methods to detect and characterize AD-related circRNAs from multiple human brain
regions, and integrate them with ADSP genetic findings (Aim 1). In Aim 2, aside from discovering AD-
related RBPs from human brain RNA-seq, proteomics and ADSP WES/WGS data, we will leverage the
ENCODE CLIP-seq data for RBP binding to identify putative RBP-circRNA interactions with AD, i.e. AD-
related functional RNA elements. Finally, in Aim 3, we will select the top 10% of the circRNAs (~200) and
RBPs (~150) for further high-throughput functional evaluation with a novel, powerful 3D human organoid
model of ADRD, termed AstAD that exhibits the full range of tau pathology and neurodegeneration. We
anticipate that our integrative analyses of ADSP genetics, circRNA, mRNA, RBP and the high-
throughput AstAD functional screen readouts can help generate testable hypothesis for future molecular
mechanisms experimental design."
11126415,"PROGRAM SUMMARY
The objective of our LAUNCH program is to continue our global health research training program called the
Global Health Equity Scholars (GHES) designed to create a new community of researchers, educators, and
professionals who are prepared to address new and emerging global health challenges. We will build on the last
nine years of this training program to create a cadre of new researchers who will dedicate their research careers
to address the health problems that arise out of the inequity of human conditions prevalent in informal human
settlements (also referred to as slums). Rather than addressing one disease at a time, we propose to provide a
comprehensive, multidisciplinary, and integrated approach to deal with urban and rural informal human
settlement health issues, developed over many years by the participating faculty members of this program. This
program will comprise four US partner institutions (Consortium) - Yale University, Stanford University, University
of Arizona, and University of California at Berkeley, each led by a leader in global health research with more
than 10 years of collaboration among themselves. Together, core faculty mentors from these institutions conduct
research at 25 institutions in 21 countries, representing regions of Africa, Central and South America, the
Caribbean, Asia, the Pacific, and Eastern Europe. The GHES program will address a wide range of health
research topics including HIV/AIDs, emerging and high-consequence infectious diseases, non-communicable
diseases (NCDs), women's health, environmental health, mental health, interpersonal violence, substance
abuse, injuries, and the interaction of all of these health issues within the framework of slum health. Training will
target US postdoctoral fellows and pre-doctoral students and low and middle-income country (LMIC) postdoctoral
fellows. We plan to recruit 9-10 trainees/year with 60% of them as US postdoctoral fellows. The trainees will
spend 10-12-months at an LMIC site under the supervision of the Consortium and their collaborating LMIC
mentors. Workshops on global health research methods, skill development and career development will be
conducted both in-person and online. LMIC trainees will spend 2-3 months at US institutions to undergo training
in methods not provided at their institutions. All of the trainees will be provided with research and career
mentorship throughout their training and tracked for career development after completion of their GHES-
supported research work. Thus, under this program, we expect the trainees to be exposed to one important
theme in global health research - health equity - through research that deals with health concerns of vulnerable
populations residing in informal human settlements and provide them with an opportunity to become experts in
this new global health discipline. The overall impact of this training program is, therefore, to create a new cadre
of global health researchers and leaders who address the emerging health issues arising out of ever-expanding
informal human settlements of LMICs."
11124583,"Project Summary/Abstract
Neuropathological interactions between COVID-19 and ADRD suggest shared molecular and cellular
mechanisms. A recent case series study revealed striking cutaneous Lewy pathology (phosphorylated α-
synuclein) in Long-COVID Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) patients. Animal studies
consistently show that viral infection can trigger α-synucleinopathies in hamster and macaque SARS-CoV-2
infection models. SARS-CoV-2 N-and Spike protein can bind to α-Synuclein to induce Lewy pathology in vitro.
Recent human single-neuron sequencing findings of accumulation of non-germline inherited somatic mutations
associated with neurodegenerative disorders support the pathogenic role of genotoxic stress in age-dependent
long-lasting neurologic deficits and cognitive decline. These observations support the role of infection in the
pathogenesis of synucleinopathy, a pathological intracellular proteinaceous α-Synuclein (α-Syn) inclusions that
are characteristic of neurological disorders, including dementia with Lewy body (DLB), LB variant of Alzheimer's
disease (LBVAD), PD, NBIA-1, and MSA, with DLB being the second most common type of dementia after AD.
Ours and other studies have begun to reveal the role of genotoxic stress interplaying with autophagy-lysosome
function in synucleinopathy. To study the impact of virus infection on synucleinopathy in vivo, we created a
human ACE2 transgenic mouse model with full-length human ACE2 regulatory regions that faithfully
recapitulated the structure, tissue distribution, and gene regulation of the human gene. A strategy was developed
to model the robust immunopathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection to facilitate the longitudinal analysis in an ABSL-
2 facility. Two months after the virus infection, mice demonstrated cognitive deficits, anosmia, and
neuroinflammation, recapitulating clinical features in long COVID patients and, surprisingly, with Lewy pathology.
Inhibiting genotoxic stress can effectively lessen inflammation, cell senescence, accumulation of α-Synuclein,
autophagy deficits, neuroinflammation, and PASC-like symptoms. We hypothesize viral inflammation-inflicted
genotoxic stress interacts with autophagy/lysosome pathway to precipitate Lewy pathology and drives chronic
neurocognitive and neurological deficits. Aim 1 will determine if virus infection-inflicted genotoxic stress can
accelerate the progression of Lewy pathology and cognitive deficits in a mouse model of LBD. Aim 2 will trace
the temporal and spatial progression of viral infection-driven olfactory spreading of Lewy pathology and genotoxic
stress and autophagy-lysosome dysfunction with a novel genetic sensor. Aim 3 will dissect the causal pathogenic
role of virus-inflicted genotoxic stress in Lewy pathology and olfactory and cognitive deficits via pharmacologic
and a novel ""seek and rescue"" genetic intervention. This project promises novel animal models, tools,
approaches, and mechanistic studies of the converging pathogenic cross-talking of genotoxic stress with
autophagy-lysosome pathways in mediating the neuropathologic interaction of virus infection and dementia. The
findings will transform the current paradigm of the viral origin of neurodegeneration and advance the therapeutic
targeting of genotoxic stress for PASCs, Lewy pathology, and dementia.

11125038,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal describes a five-year career development program that will lead the PI to a career as an
independent physician-scientist, studying mechanisms and potential therapeutics of developmental and
epileptic encephalopathies.
Applicant: Dr. Ziobro holds M.D. and Ph.D. degrees and has completed specialty clinical training in both Child
Neurology and Pediatric Epilepsy. She has previous experience in neuroscience research using rodent,
neuronal cell culture, and organotypic hippocampal cell culture models of acquired epilepsy. This career
development plan includes a period of mentored research designed to develop the applicant’s knowledge in
advanced imaging techniques, viral vector design, brain slice electrophysiology, and interneuron development.
These skills will complement her current skill-set and propel her development as an independent researcher.
The concepts learned during this training period will be broadly applicable to multiple disease processes and
allow for significant clinical translation in a clinically relevant field of study.
Research Plan: PCDH19-clustering epilepsy (PCE) is one of the most common monogenic developmental
and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs), characterized by cognitive impairment and intractable seizure clusters
starting in infancy. PCDH19 is and X-linked gene that encodes a transmembrane cell adhesion molecule,
critical for cell interactions during brain development. PCE affects females and rare mosaic males, while males
expressing only mutant PCDH19 do not develop epilepsy. A leading hypothesis to explain this phenomenon is
that it occurs due to cellular interference associated with random X-inactivation (or mosaic mutations) in which
cells expressing wild type and those expressing mutant PCDH19 fail to interact properly during brain
development, which is supported by a preliminary data showing a unique cell segregation pattern of Pcdh19+
and Pcdh19- neurons in the cortex and hippocampus of the PCE mouse model. Our central hypothesis is that
mosaic Pcdh19 expression alters interneuron development in the hippocampal CA1 region leading to aberrant
network formation, hyperexcitability and increased seizure susceptibility. This proposal will characterize
histologic (Aim 1) physiologic (Aim 2) and developmental (Aim 3) mechanisms of PCE. This study will provide
significant insight into the mechanisms of PCE and guide potential therapeutic strategies that may be
applicable to multiple genetic epilepsies."
11125016,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The evolution of bacterial resistance to antibiotics is precipitating a medical crisis that will cause
millions of deaths and cost trillions in dollars. A major bacterial driver of resistance is so-called
extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC), a member of the human microbiome that has reached
pandemic status because of its deadly combination of resistance and virulence. ExPEC is now
the leading cause of resistance-related human mortality worldwide. There is no FDA-approved
vaccine, and efforts to identify novel targets for vaccine development have been hampered by the
pleiotropic nature of this bacterium’s pangenome. Using an exhaustive comparative genomics
approach of > 20,000 sequenced strains covering all sequence types, pathotypes, and
phylogenies, we uncovered two high-priority virulence factor targets that met multiple vaccine-
development criteria. Hypothesizing that immunological blockade of the function of these two
factors will provide a one-two punch that prevents critical steps in systemic infection and invasive
disease, we propose here pre-clinical studies aimed at testing the prophylactic efficacy of such
an approach. This includes a comprehensive evaluation of the vaccine’s performance to prevent
three distinct types of ExPEC infection, a thorough optimization of basic vaccine parameters,
innovation around novel adjuvants, and finally, the immunological mechanism of protection.
Successful completion of this project will yield knowledge as to whether targeting factors important
for invasive infection is an effective strategy to reduce or eliminate global ExPEC-induced
mortality and morbidity."
11125589,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The long-term objectives of our research program are to (i) discover novel bacterial natural products
(NPs), (ii) elucidate the biosynthetic pathways and regulatory mechanisms of these NPs, and (iii) characterize
and utilize the discovered NPs and their biosynthetic enzymes for biomedical and biotechnological applications.
NPs are highly functionalized and evolutionarily optimized small molecules that possess unrivaled chemical
and structural diversities, resulting in a wide range of biological activities. Terpenoids, the largest and most
structurally diverse family of NPs, are considered rare in bacteria; only ~1.2% of known terpenoids are of
bacterial origin. However, genomics studies revealed that the biosynthetic enzymes responsible for terpenoid
biosynthesis are widely distributed in bacteria, particularly actinobacteria. We hypothesize that (i) bacterial
terpenoids are considerably underestimated among current NP libraries and the discovery and characterization
of novel terpenoids will lead to new drug leads and (ii) understanding the sequence-structure-function
relationships of terpenoid biosynthetic enzymes will lead to new opportunities in genome mining, combinatorial
biosynthesis, and oxidative biocatalysis. Our initial efforts follow two research directions that address
immediate needs and will set the stage for continued success in the field of terpenoid discovery and
biosynthesis. In the first direction, we will use an integrated genomics–metabolomics approach to discovery
novel bacterial terpenoids from bacteria. This will include the development of new and innovative
methodologies for targeted identification of complex bacterial terpenoids and the activation or upregulation of
terpenoid biosynthetic gene clusters. In the second direction, we will elucidate the biosynthetic pathways of
both new and known bacterial terpenoids and functionally, mechanistically, and structurally characterize
terpene synthases and their associated oxidative enzymes, particularly cytochrome P450s. We will use a
rigorous multidisciplinary approach involving genome mining, bioinformatics analysis, in vivo pathway
engineering, (un)natural product isolation and structural determination, in vitro enzymology, and protein X-ray
crystallography. Our experience in terpenoid biosynthesis and enzymology and our significant progress in
both research directions supports the feasibility of the proposed research and that we are well-suited to
establish and sustain a successful independent program in this field. In addition, we have established several
key collaborations with leaders in the fields of synthetic biology, NP drug discovery, and X-ray
crystallography that further strengthen this research program. Expected outcomes of this research program
include the revelation of the bacterial terpenome, understanding the underlying principles of how terpene
synthases dictate terpene cyclization, and the exploitation of naturally evolved oxidative enzymes to create a
toolbox of biocatalysts."
10913988,"Background and Hypothesis: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a deadly disease, where Group 1 PAH and
Group 3 PH are driven by hypoxia, HIF-2α, and non-coding RNAs. We found that the lncRNA KMT2E-AS1 is
up-regulated in Groups 1/3 PH and is induced by HIF-2α. This lncRNA gene neighbors KMT2E, a gene
controlling histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and chromatin remodeling. In pulmonary endothelial cells
(ECs), KMT2E-AS1 stabilizes KMT2E to increase H3K4me3, thus driving HIF-2α-specific metabolic and
pathogenic alterations. The G-allele of single nucleotide variant (SNV) rs73184087 within KMT2E is associated
with risk of developing Group 1 PAH (in discovery/validation cohorts and a meta-analysis of 2,181 PAH vs.
10,060 controls). rs73184087 also displays more avid allele (G)-specific association with HIF-2α leading to
induction of this lncRNA-KMT2E pair. A mouse deficient in the conserved lncRNA sequence is protected against
Groups 1/3 PH; this is phenocopied by inhibition of histone methylation in PAH rats. We postulate that the
KMT2E-AS1/KMT2E axis is a central lynchpin in pathogenic reprogramming in ECs, promoting PH. Aim
1) Define the allele-specific role of the KMT2E SNV rs73184087 in controlling HIF-2α-dependent EC
lncRNA-KMT2E expression and PH pathophenotypes. Using ECs derived from genome-edited inducible
pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) as well as primary lung ECs carrying rs73184087 A and G alleles, we will determine
if (G) increases lncRNA-KMT2E by more HIF-2α binding and drives more severe EC phenotypes. We will also
pursue expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis in blood samples from PAH patients
(discovery/validation cohorts) and PAH lung tissues carrying A and G alleles of rs73184087. Aim 2) Define the
role of this lncRNA-KMT2E axis and H3K4me3 in promoting PH in vivo. We will quantify Groups 1/3 PH
severity in rodents after EC-specific knockdown of this lncRNA vs. lncRNA+KMT2E and after AAV-driven EC-
specific expression of lncRNA vs. lncRNA+KMTE2. We will also determine if MM-589, a specific H3K4me3
inhibitor, reverses PAH in rats. Thus, we aim to determine if lncRNA+KMT2E together are necessary and
sufficient to drive Group 1/3 PH and if PAH is dependent upon H3K4me3 activity, thus offering a new epigenetic
PH therapy. Aim 3) Define the causative role of the G allele of rs73184087 on pulmonary vascular
remodeling and PH in vivo. Culturing human precision cut lung slices, we will determine if the rs73184087 G
allele drives vascular remodeling via regulation of the lncRNA-KMT2E axis and H3K4me3. We have also inserted
the human rs73184087 G vs. A allele in mice and will use these “humanized” mice to study these alleles in vivo.
With these 2 unique platforms, we will determine if the G allele drives HIF-2α-specific EC phenotypes and PH.
Significance: We plan to shift paradigms of lncRNA biology in PH, via defining the links of hypoxia to epigenetics
and metabolism and by introducing new epigenetic therapies. By establishing the causative role of rs73184087
in PH, we are poised to leverage functional genomics to gain mechanistic insight in PH specifically for humans."
10830424,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Overview:
The preBotzinger Complex (preBotC) is the neuronal network that drives inspiratory rhythmogenesis
whose activity is orchestrated in response to changes in homeostasis and is critical for maintaining and
adapting breathing to the demands of the organism. Respiratory networks are constantly modulated by
numerous neuromodulators through altering properties of neurons, synapses and networks.
Understanding action of neuromodulation on respiratory networks is critical to understanding control of
breathing. While there is extensive experimental effort on studying network effects of neuromodulation,
the mechanisms underlying neuromodulatory action on respiratory network properties cannot be easily
understood just by experimental work alone. Despite the well-established utility of computational
approaches to studying the neural control of breathing, a knowledge gap exists for a computational
understanding of the detailed mechanisms underlying how different neuromodulators interact to impact
respiratory rhythmogenesis. The overall objective of this proposal is to uncover the mechanism by which
the temporal order of neuromodulation with opposing actions (i.e., inhibitory and excitatory) differentially
impact respiratory network dynamics. Our preliminary data suggest that such temporal sequencing can
induce bifurcations and bistability in network states. We hypothesize that temporal order of opposing
neuromodulators yields different changes in intrinsic and synaptic properties of a network which together
produce qualitatively different network behaviors when the order is reversed. We will combine
electrophysiological experiments and computational modeling across the levels of molecules
(glutamates), neurons and networks to test this hypothesis via a focus on respiration, with three Specific
Aims: (1) Identify how changes in inhibitory neuromodulation (e.g., opioids) impacts synaptic dynamics
and properties in glutamatergic synapse. (2) Dissect the mechanisms by which excitatory
neuromodulation (e.g., norepinephrine) regulates respiratory network dynamics through changes in both
intrinsic and synaptic properties. (3) Examine the synaptic and intrinsic mechanisms by which temporal
order of opposing neuromodulators produces different network states. We will explore and identify
relevant bifurcations induced by temporal order of neuromodulators using dynamical systems theory."

11128933,"Project Summary
Chronic neuropathic pain (CNP) is usually caused by disease or damage involving the somatosensory nervous
system, adversely affecting millions of Americans. It is difficult to treat and remains a major clinical problem.
Opioids, acting through opioid receptors (ORs: MOR for µ, KOR for κ, DOR for δ, NOP for nociceptin), trigger a
complex signaling system and function as powerful analgesics. However, chronic opioid treatment causes
hyperalgesia/analgesic tolerance and addiction, which have resulted in an opioid epidemic in the U.S. The
opioid-induced hyperalgesia /analgesic tolerance (OIH/AT) and addiction can be modulated by many factors
including OR expression levels and heteromer formation with different ORs (for example, MOR-DOR) or with
other receptors such as the cannabinoid receptor (CNR1). Our long-term goal is to develop new strategies to
enhance opioid analgesic effects and reduce opioid consumption for treatment of CNP. REST is a major
epigenetic regulator. We and others have found that overexpression (OE) of REST in the dorsal root ganglion
(DRG), causing repression of the MOR gene oprm1, is linked to the onset and maintenance of CNP. Our
recent studies indicate that peripheral nerve injury in fact reduces opioid analgesia via the REST corepressor
G9a-mediated chromatin repression of oprm1. Further, our preliminary studies suggest that MORs in DRG
neurons are essential for OIH/AT. This would suggest that the REST-MOR axis in DRG neurons is a major
mechanism regulating both CNP and OIH/AT. However, although the discovery of oprm1 as a REST target
using a gene-by-gene approach is useful, it is unclear whether REST regulates the impacts of opioid analgesia
in CNP or in OIH/AT by controlling the expression of other ORs or CNR1 or both of these processes. Our
preliminary results suggest that REST differentially regulates expression of these receptors in DRG neurons.
While it causes a decrease in the expression of MOR and DOR, it causes an increase in the expression of
NOP and CNR1, perhaps by repressing the expression of an inhibitor of these genes such as a miRNA. To
begin to generate comprehensive insights into the role of REST in CNP, we have now developed an innovative
experimental system consisting of Rest conditional knock-out (cKO) mice and REST conditional OE (cOE)
mice. Preliminary results indicate that whereas DRG-specific Rest cKO mice show attenuated pain
hypersensitivity after nerve injury, DRG-specific REST cOE mice exhibit pain hypersensitivity even without
nerve injury. Thus, the two contrasting mouse models recapitulate the chronic pain transition and provide a
robust system in which to study mechanisms governing OR expression in primary sensory neurons in CNP and
in OIH/AT. Here we propose to test the central hypothesis that REST in DRG neurons is involved in regulating
opioid analgesia in CNP and in OIH/AT by governing ORs/CNR1 expression through epigenomic regulation of
these genes. Thus, manipulation of REST in DRG neurons could be utilized to increase opioid analgesic
efficacy and reduce opioid consumption. The project is responsive to PAR-18-742."
10805362,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Skeletal fragility is a recently recognized complication of Type 1 diabetes (T1D), and is of particular concern
among older adults. Patients with T1D have a striking 5- to 7-fold higher risk of hip fractures as compared to
nondiabetics. However, the mechanisms that underlie the increased fracture risk in T1D are poorly
understood. This proposal seeks to delineate the mechanisms of skeletal fragility at the hip in older adults with
T1D, among whom fracture risk is highest. Aim 1 will evaluate prospective changes in bone density, structure,
strength, and cortical bone quality in postmenopausal women and men age >/=50 years with T1D as compared
to nondiabetic controls. Aim 2 will investigate the potential contributions of diabetic complications, such as
glycemic profiling (using continuous glucose monitoring), advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) and
microvascular disease, to skeletal endpoints and age-related bone loss. Finally, Aim 3 will utilize ex vivo
femoral specimens to directly assess femoral bone composition and biomechanical strength among adults with
longstanding T1D. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts to perform this study, and we will
leverage existing richly profiled cohorts as well as recruit new cohorts for detailed skeletal phenotyping to
clarify the impact of T1D on bone health. Our studies will provide novel insights about alterations in femoral
bone structure and quality in T1D, and will clarify the impact of glycemic control and diabetic complications on
skeletal fragility. Successful completion of this project will inform strategies to lower fracture risk among older
adults with T1D."

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), also known as “forever chemicals”, are emerging contaminants of
concern due to their prevalence (in 99% of blood samples in the U.S.), long half-life, and adverse health effects
in humans. PFAS can be released, mobilized, and redistributed in the environment during emergencies such as
fires, industrial incidents, hurricanes, and flooding, thus enhancing human exposures and health effects. A major
challenge associated with these emergencies is protecting vulnerable populations including first responders,
frontline personnel, and communities at the impacted sites. There is a critical need for the development of
practical strategies to minimize dietary exposures to PFAS from drinking water and food, which account for 90%
of human exposures. Mitigation strategies using edible sorbents in the diet are safe for human consumption. The
long-term goal is to establish therapeutic sorbent interventions that will reduce oral and inhalation exposures to
complex environmental contaminants and microbes. The overall objective of this project is to develop edible,
multicomponent sorbents that will effectively reduce PFAS exposures from the diet. In this project, six
representative PFAS and their mixtures have been selected for complementary in vitro, in silico, and in vivo
studies. In Aim 1, multicomponent sorbents including processed and nutrient-amended clays will be derived from
materials that are naturally occurring, or generally recognized as safe. The in vitro adsorption studies will be
conducted in simulated gastrointestinal tract models to characterize surface interactions. The detoxification
efficacy of sorbent treatment will be validated in mammalian cell models and a living organism (Hydra vulgaris).
In Aim 2, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, energetic analysis, minimalistic MD simulations, and data-driven
models will be used to study complex systems containing mixtures of PFAS and multicomponent sorbents.
Computational studies will validate sorption mechanisms and thermodynamics and integrate with Aim 1 for
sorbent selection and characterization. In Aim 3, the efficacy and safety of selected sorbents will be tested in
vivo. Male and pregnant female rats will be exposed to PFAS and sorbents will be included in the diet at varying
doses for 3 weeks. The 3 sorbents that most effectively reduce the PFAS bioavailability and show no interference
with nutrients will be included in a 6-month safety study. Parameters to be determined include 1) PFAS
bioavailability in blood, urine, and breast milk, 2) nutrient levels, 3) body weight, relative organ-to-body weight,
and infant birth weight, 4) feed conversion efficiency, and 5) clinical blood biochemistry. It is expected that
therapeutic sorbents developed in this research will be field-practical and easily delivered orally to neutralize
PFAS mixtures from dietary exposures to protect and treat vulnerable populations during emergencies."

project is focused on the novel mechanisms Coxiella has evolved to manipulate the host
cell. The Coxiella Dot/Icm type IVb secretion system is essential for intracellular
replication. The goal of this project is to understand how effector proteins delivered into
host cells by the Dot/Icm system enable Coxiella to replicate in a hydrolytic lysosomal
organelle and evade host detection. We have developed genetic tools to identify the
important Coxiella proteins that are required for host manipulation. This project will
leverage these genetic tools in combination with molecular and biochemical approaches
to investigate how these effector proteins interfere with host pathogen sensors, promote
biogenesis of the unique Coxiella-containing vacuole (CCV), and facilitate infection in
animals. Knowledge gained from these studies will lead to a greater understanding of
pathogen adaptations that enable Coxiella to infect mammalian hosts and the immune
pathways that are important for controlling intracellular bacterial pathogens. Specific goals
include functional analysis of the proteins EmcA and EmcB that are involved in
suppression of host immune responses, using newly developed genetic tools to define
epistatic interactions between effectors required for CCV biogenesis, and to use
bioluminescence imaging to measure virulence defects displayed by Coxiella effector
mutants."
11134809,"This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as “NOT-CA-
24-058.” Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with early detection being
critical for improving prognosis. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) provides a comprehensive dataset
of longitudinal low-dose CT scans, offering a unique opportunity to study the natural history of lung nodules.
This project aims to improve early diagnosis of lung cancer by characterizing the differential trajectory of
benign and malignant nodules on serial CTs, identifying and longitudinally tracking all nodules across NLST
participants. By modeling the natural course of nodules on serial imaging studies within the NLST, we will
expedite the identification of patients who develop cancer and those who do not, and better understand the
natural history of individual nodules and nodule loadings within each patient. The parent project, a prospective
observational trial, has successfully recruited a diverse cohort of participants and advanced AI-based
algorithms for nodule assessment and cancer risk stratification, integrating longitudinal multimodal data. Since
our initial proposal in 2019, substantial technological innovations in AI and CT harmonization have emerged,
enhancing our potential to accurately characterize lung nodules. Specifically, our team has developed
innovative AI-based kernel harmonization techniques and body composition analysis, significantly improving
nodule assessment accuracy. These advancements have positioned us well to explore new avenues in lung
cancer detection and risk assessment, justifying the need for supplemental funding to integrate these emerging
technologies and expand our research scope. The proposed supplemental project introduces innovative
approaches to lung cancer detection by longitudinally tracking all nodules across multiple CT scans, providing
a dynamic view of nodule behavior. By employing kernel harmonization techniques, we will ensure consistent
and reliable biomarker measurements across different machines, acquisition protocols, and reconstructions,
enhancing the robustness of our models. Additionally, incorporating radiologic features beyond the spatial
boundaries of the nodules, such as tumor-free surrounding lung parenchyma and patient-specific
characteristics like body habitus, will offer a personalized understanding of nodule dynamics and lung cancer
risk, improving precision in risk stratification and aiding early detection efforts. The overall impact of the project
is to improve the early detection and risk stratification of lung cancer by leveraging the comprehensive NLST
dataset. By characterizing the natural history of lung nodules and understanding the influence of patient
characteristics, the developed models and biomarkers will provide valuable tools for radiologists and clinicians,
enhancing precision cancer screening and ultimately reducing lung cancer mortality. The improved
understanding of the natural history of lung nodules will ideally position the next stage of efforts for AI validation
in randomized control trials, both by our team and others."

11134948,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cancer is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US and in the world. One approach to reducing
the risk and burden of cancer is to use preventive agents and interventions that are effective and safe.
According to the Division of Cancer Prevention (DCP) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), this requires the
systematic development of cancer preventive agents and interventions, with three critical components; i)
preclinical/toxicology studies for identification of agents, ii) early phase trials of identified agents and other
promising interventions, and iii) late phase III trials of preventive agents and interventions that have
successfully passed through early phase trials, in a three-legged approach.
The goal of the Cancer Prevention Clinical Trials Network (CP-CTNet) is to identify safe and effective
preventive agents and interventions in order to advance their further clinical development for cancer
prevention. Further clinical development is to be undertaken in late phase III trials conducted by the third leg,
i.e. the National Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), supported by the DCP's Community
Oncology and Prevention Trials Research Group, to ultimately reduce the risk and burden of cancer. As the
second leg of this three-legged approach, the CP-CTNet will conduct early phase trials to assess the safety,
tolerability, and cancer preventive potential of agents and interventions of varying classes identified by the first
leg, i.e. the DCP's Cancer Preclinical Drug Development Program (PREVENT) support of preclinical/toxicology
studies, many of which target molecules or processes known to be important during carcinogenesis. The CP-
CTNet Sites will perform these early phase trials supported by the DCP and the CP-CTNet Data Management,
Auditing, and Coordinating Center (DMACC). These trials include phase 0 (micro-dosing), phase I (dose-
finding), and phase II (preliminary efficacy) clinical trials.
To support these early phase trials, which will be conducted by the CP-CTNet sites alone or as cross-Network
trials, the CP-CTNet DMACC will coordinate trans-Network activities and provide expertise and resources in 1)
centralized data management and reporting, 2) clinical trials auditing, and 3) administrative and logistical
coordination, including expertise in clinical trials methodology and biostatistics, across CP-CTNet. In addition,
the CP-CTNet DMACC will provide an advisory role in early phase caner prevention trial development for all
CP-CTNet trials and the primary statistical role for cross-Network trials."

The liver is central to mammalian metabolism and plays a critical role in providing fuel to other tissues
particularly when food is limiting. People with disparate inborn errors in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation 
exhibit life-threatening hypoketotic-hypoglycemia following a fast due to the critical role of fatty acid oxidation to
gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis. To understand the contribution of hepatic fatty acid oxidation to systemic
metabolic dysfunction, we have generated multiple transgenic mice with an altered ability to oxidize long chain 
fatty acids via mitochondrial β-oxidation specifically in hepatocytes. Here we will leverage extensive genetic

Duplex sequencing offers a much-reduced error rate of sequencing and allows for the detection
of somatic variation at the single molecule level. Duplex sequencing is part of the proposed
experimental design of three GCCs (BCM, Broad and NYGC), although each center plans to use
a different technology: NanoSeq/CompDuplex (BCM), CODEC (Broad) or Ultima duplex (NYGC).
In addition, TTDs are further developing a tagmentation-based duplex sequencing assay (VISTA-
seq, BCH - Choudhury), long-read sequencing with ultralow error rates (HiDEF-seq, NYU) and a
single-cell version of the CompDuplex method (BCM).
Throughout our existing collaborative project, we have applied each of these technologies to the
COLO829 cell line mixture and benchmarking tissues from the SMaHT Network. Following full
analysis and dissemination of the benchmarking results, there is a need within the SMaHT
Network to i) scale up existing duplex technologies at the GCC, ii) implement duplex technologies
developed at TTDs at the GCC, and iii) explore the application of ultradeep, targeted duplex
sequencing for variant validation and driver discovery.
Here, we seek to address those needs by scaling up production of CODEC at the Broad and by
testing, implementing and applying the newly developed HiDEF-seq method. We will apply these
methods to all samples from two Tier 1 SMAHT donors. In addition, we will explore using targeted
duplex sequencing approaches, based on CODEC, HiDEF-seq or NanoSeq, for variant validation
and detection of positive selection through discovery of somatic mutations in key genes or

Genomics data sharing is of paramount importance to accelerate biomedical research and facilitate higher power
in analysis. However, privacy and security concerns can hinder large scale data sharing across institutions and
nations. Human genomics data contain unique information that is identifiable, and inappropriate sharing would
put individual’s privacy at risk and potentially lead to leakage of sensitive personal information. Also, patients’
consents are crucial for genomic studies, and therefore novel sociotechnical methods are also essential for
researchers to consider while conducting human genomic research. We intend to close the technology gap and
bring advanced enabling technology to support human genomic research. We have organized a series of
competitions to evaluate state-of-the-art privacy and security models with real-world motivated analysis tasks
with companion workshops. As an emerging interdisciplinary community, we are pushing the frontiers of genomic
privacy and security research. Motivated by our previous successes, we are proposing to continue the effort.
We plan to engage and support researchers from nationally underrepresented groups to participate in our
competitions and attend the workshops."
11135226,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The purpose of this administrative supplement (PA-20-272) is to support work on the Fitbit-mNCANDA project
component of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence-Adulthood (NCANDA-
A) over a 1-year period. NCANDA-A aims to identify neural, behavioral, and environmental risk markers for
problem adolescent and emerging adult alcohol use, determine the impact of alcohol exposure variations on
brain maturation and behavior, identify characteristics predicting AUD resilience and recovery, and characterize
sex-specific risks. Some of these critical questions can be addressed with daily data that are currently being
collected as part of the mNCANDA-Fitbit protocol. In order for these data to be useful to the scientific community,
dedicated effort is required to collate all these data, tailor an analytical pipeline, and prepare summary variables
that can be released for use in analytical models, proposed with this supplement.
Initiating excessive alcohol drinking during adolescence disturbs typical neurodevelopmental patterns, increases
the risk of developing alcohol use disorder, and accelerates involutional processes in adulthood. NCANDA-A
follows a diverse community sample of participants recruited at ages 2-21 years and tracked over the last 8 years
across 5 sites (N=831; 93% retention rate). Monitoring in NCANDA-A includes a new protocol that involves
tracking behaviors for 4 weeks with a Fitbit and daily self-reports with the mNCANDA app.
In Aim 1, NCANDA-A investigates the impact of excessive alcohol drinking during adolescence and emerging
adulthood on subsequent developmental trajectories of cognitive performance, brain structure and function, and
psychopathology. Aim 2 analyses will identify neurodevelopment patterns describing the extent to which
alcohol's effects on brain structure and function resolve or persist during desistance after binge drinking. Aim 3
will deploy data-driven analysis to identify adolescent biological, environmental, and behavioral factors that
forecast excessive drinking during early adulthood. In Aim 4, NCANDA-A will quantify the impact of the COVID
pandemic on life stress and social, emotional, and economic wellbeing and their relations with alcohol use
patterns. In Aim 5, the SRI and Pittsburgh sites will identify interactions among patterns of alcohol use, sleep,
and cardiac function. In Aim 6, the UCSD, Duke and OHSU sites will determine the extent to which short-term
(i.e., 4 weeks) alcohol use discontinuation results in acute improvement in cognition, affect, sleep and resting
heart rate, and reversal of the adverse structural and functional brain effects of frequent binge alcohol use.
With this supplement, for Aim S1, we propose tailoring an ad-hoc pipeline for data analysis of the high-density
NCANDA dataset (mNCANDA + Fitbit) and prepare a dataset and data dictionary of the summary variables that
can be added to the main NCANDA dataset for public release. Supplemental funding would ensure these data
are useful to all investigators, enriching the NCANDA project and providing novel information on the effects of
drinking on functioning during emerging adulthood."
10811672,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related
mortality in the world. Desmoplasia is the most prominent characteristic of PDAC and comprises
up to 80% of the tumor mass. Desmoplasia plays important roles in tumorigenesis and
aggressiveness by promoting the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells, enhancing
angiogenesis, impeding drug penetration, and contributing to immune evasion. However, clinical
trials employing strategies to deplete PDAC stroma have failed. The stroma acts not only as a
barrier to the penetration of drug and effector T cells, but also as a barrier to restrain the
metastasis of PDAC tumors. Complete depletion of the stroma, therefore, leads to a more
aggressive tumor and a poor survival rate. By contrast, normalization, instead of depletion, of the
stroma in combination with chemotherapy or immunotherapy to kill tumor cells within the stromal
microenvironment is a promising strategy for PDAC therapy.
 In the stromal microenvironment, activated pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) transform from a
quiescent state into a myofibroblast-like phenotype and express a large amount of extracellular
matrix (ECM). Type I collagen proteins are the main component of the ECM and are responsible
for the major desmoplastic reaction. High levels of type I collagen are associated with a low
survival rate for patients with PDAC. Type I collagen promotes the proliferation and migration of
PDAC cells and inhibits apoptotic cells by binding to integrin.
 We discovered that silencing the poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (αCP2) with siRNA reverses the
accumulation of type I collagen in activated PSCs. Our central hypothesis is that silencing αCP2
modulates the PDAC stroma, thus improving the therapeutic index of chemotherapy and
immunotherapy. The long-term goal of the project is to develop a combination therapy strategy to
treat PDAC."
10848434,"Project Summary
A major obstacle to successful adoptive cell therapy (ACT) is the development of acquired resistance, which
can occur due to cancer cells become invisible to tumor-specific T cells when cancer cells downregulate or lost
the antigen(s) (refers to antigen-low/loss resistant tumor cells, or ALRs). In this proposal, we will explore the
role of reprogramming of tumor microenvironment (TME) by p38 MAPK inhibition to promote a robust dendritic
cell (DC)-driving anti-ALR immunity to prevent acquired resistance in ACT. In our in vivo preliminary studies,
co-treatment with CAR T cells and Ralimetinib (a potent and selective inhibitor of p38 MAPK developed for
cancer patients) confers immunogenic DC signature characteristics within TME. Strikingly, CAR T
cell+Ralimetinib-treatment eradicated established tumors and resulted in long-term tumor-free survival by
triggering a robust host anti-ALR immunity, whereas CAR T cell ACT alone recapitulated the clinical scenario
of cancer relapse mediated by ALRs. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that p38 MAPK is a
critical molecular switch that controls DC differentiation, where p38 inhibition promotes an immunogenic DC
transcriptional program and induces potent anti-ALR immunity to prevent the acquired resistance in T cell
therapy. Aim 1 will determine the role of NFκB/Stat5 signaling by repression of PPARγ in the molecular
mechanisms of Ralimetinib-mediated DC enrichment. Aim 2 will determine the role of NFκB (p50)-dependent
viral mimicry in DCs for ALR clearance after p38 inhibitor-treatment in vivo. This study may uncover a novel
mechanism for preventing tumor relapse in ACT. Data from our proposed Aims may yield critically needed
evidence that repurposing the clinically tested Ralimetinib from targeting p38 MAPK in tumor cells toward that
of immune cells may induce a complete and durable response in ACT. This translationally relevant work could
then lay the foundation for future clinical trials."

The equipment supplement funds will facilitate parent grant GM122448 (A.K. Hopper, PI) by supporting purchase
of an Integra Mini 96-channel pipetter which will greatly facilitate original proposed work in Aims 2 and 3.
GM122448 focuses on tRNA biology and its subcellular trafficking. tRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that are
essential for decoding the genome by delivering amino acids to translating ribosomes according to codon
directions in mRNAs. Defects in tRNA biology cause numerous human disorders from metabolic diseases, to
neuromuscular diseases, and to cancer. tRNA biology requires a complex set of conserved gene products for
post-transcriptional processing, subcellular traffic, and intron turnover. The research program impacts upon
multiple facets of gene expression, quality control, and issues important to human health. We employ budding
yeast and in vivo technologies to discover unknown important aspects of tRNA biology. In Aim2 of GM122884
we study trafficking of tRNAs between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Although for decades it was thought that
tRNA movement is unidirectional, nucleus to cytoplasm, we co-discovered that tRNAs move bi-directionally
between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Shaheen & Hopper 2005) and that the dynamics are conserved
between yeast and vertebrate cells (Shaheen et al. 2007). We developed a new methodology, the HCl/aniline
assay (Nostramo et al. 2020), that reports tRNA retrograde nuclear import and re-export to the cytoplasm. We
are employing this methodology in a genome-wide screen of ~6000 yeast genes to identify and characterize the
proteins functioning in the tRNA retrograde pathway. Aim 3 of GM122884 investigates tRNA introns. Possession
of tRNA introns in subsets of tRNA genes has been conserved from Archaea to humans. We recently made the
exciting discovery (Nostramo et al., Mol. Cell, in revision) that introns spliced from pre-tRNAs provide a novel
complementary-dependent mechanism to fine-tune basal mRNA levels and to assist cellular responses to stress.
We also learned that under particular stresses, subsets of tRNA introns accumulate to high levels due to
increased stability. We discovered one mechanism for tRNA intron turnover (Wu & Hopper 2014); however, there
are at least four additional unknown mechanisms to destroy tRNA introns. None of the yeast annotated RNases
appear to function in the unknown turnover pathways. Thus, we are conducting a genome-wide screen for
mutants that accumulate each of the 8 tRNA intron families whose turnover remains unknown. Although we are
able to grow yeast mutants in the deep 96-well plates, we are unable to extract RNAs in this format due to the
opaqueness of the microtiter plates; therefore, we must conduct the biochemical steps in labor-intensive
analyses of single mutants. The Integra Mini 96-channel pipettes will allow us to conduct all steps preceding
northern gel analyses for 96 strains simultaneously and thereby greatly reduce the time and safety to complete
Aims 2 and 3."

Stabilized HIV-1 envelope gp140 trimers such as BG505 SOSIP provide a viable platform to elicit protective
neutralizing antibodies that can be improved upon through various approaches to induce heterologous

macaques and is now being tested in several phase I clinical trials, including HVTN 137. Here we will perform
in-depth studies to determine how antibodies that neutralize only the autologous virus and those that also have
activity against heterologous viral variants developed in parallel during BG505 SOSIP immunization of rhesus
macaques using cryopreserved samples. We will then track the antibody germline precursors for these
neutralizing antibodies in other immunized rhesus macaques that share the allele to understand why they
sometimes failed to develop these activities. We will also compare the targets of the neutralizing antibody
responses in BG505 SOSIP immunized human subjects to those recognized in the rhesus macaque model. The
HVTN 137 trial is also administering BG505 SOSIP with different adjuvants and we will investigate how these
impact neutralizing antibody specificities in the human volunteers. Finally, we will isolate neutralizing monoclonal
antibodies from selected BG505 SOSIP immunized rhesus macaques and human subjects to compare the
structural and biophysical properties of antigen recognition. These extensive pre-clinical and clinical resources
combined with our multidisciplinary expertise provides a novel setting in which to address barriers that impede
the development of effective HIV vaccination strategies. If successful, these studies will illuminate new strategies

The Chronic Pancreatitis Diabetes Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC) research consortium is advancing care for
patients with exocrine disease, particularly focused on the overlap of these three conditions through a series of
multicenter collaborative clinically-focused research studies. The University of Minnesota (UMN) offers both
the clinical expertise and the academic environment to contribute substantially and innovatively to the CPDCP.
The UMN provides state of the art clinical care for pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, and receives patient
referrals for endoscopic and surgical management of complex acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis (CP)
from across the U.S. Dr. Bellin and Beilman (Co-PIs) will add expertise on chronic pancreatitis-related diabetes
mellitus (CP-DM) and pancreatic surgery to the current consortium membership. Together Bellin and Beilman
have established ongoing collaborations with multiple lead investigators within the CPDCP, highlighting the
ability of this team to integrate seamlessly into the existing CPDCP Clinical Centers. Through engagement as a
sub-site for Ohio State and INSPPIRE within the current consortium structure, UMN has already contributed to
ancillary studies development, manuscripts, and enrollment of participants in the CPDPC developed INSPPIRE
and DETECT protocols. In summary, UMN has documented its ability to contribute to the CPDCP goals and will
add value as a recognized Clinical Center.
As a Clinical Center within the CPDPC, we will enroll adults and children with pancreatitis into the existing
CPDPC studies including PROCEED, INSPPIRE, and DETECT (AIM 1). We will also participate in working
groups, development of protocols and standard operating procedures, and proposal of new ancillary studies. We
propose to build upon the current CPDCP efforts to define mechanisms of CP-DM by studying the
pathophysiology and mechanisms of glucose dysregulation and CP-DM after pancreatic surgery. Pancreatic
surgery including surgical drainage, Whipple procedure, or total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplant
fundamentally alters the pancreatic-intestinal anatomy and may have different endocrine mechanisms by which
hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia develop; since ~20% of patients with CP may have eventually surgery, it is
important to understand disease in this subgroup of patients, in order to properly screen for, treat, and ultimately
prevent CP-DM. For AIM 2 we will enroll patients with CP who have had surgery (n=75 per surgical group) and
an endoscopic CP and healthy control groups to test insulin, pancreatic polypeptide (PP), and incretin hormone
secretion and insulin sensitivity by mixed meal tolerance and frequent sample intravenous glucose tolerance
testing to differentiate mechanisms of dysglycemia in these groups. For AIM 3, non-diabetic patients will be re-
studied 12-18 months later to determine risk factors for progressive defects in glycemic regulation. In addition,
we will assess novel exploratory biomarkers (not routinely studied in CP-DM) including markers of beta cell
death, genetic risk factors, and beta cell autoantibodies."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal form of brain cancer in adults. The median survival of GBM patients is
only about 14-16 months after initial diagnosis. Genomic profiling has stratified GBM into various subgroups,
which are driven by specific genetic alternations of core signaling pathways. However, targeted therapies, such
as therapies against receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, have failed in the clinic. Tumor-cell genetic heterogeneity
is one of the main reasons for this failure. In contrast, the tumor microenvironment (TME) of GBM is genetically
stable, and are considering as the promising therapeutic targets. Tumor-associated microglia and macrophages
(TAMs) are the most abundant cell population in the TME, which account for up to 50% of total cells in the GBM
tumor mass. Our recent studies have demonstrated that circadian regulator CLOCK/BMAL1 is an oncogene in
GBM and highly expressed in glioma stem cells (GSCs), which acts to increase GSC self-renewal through
metabolic effects, and recruit microglia into the TME by upregulating chemokine olfactomedin-like 3 (OLFML3)
expression (Chen et al., Cancer Discovery, 2020). However, the underlying molecular basis for how OLFML3
triggers microglial infiltration and subsequently how microglia affect immunosuppression and immunotherapy
has yet to be determined. Thus, our overall goal in this study is to address this knowledge gap, and in so doing
will develop potential therapeutic strategies targeting microglia for treating GBM. To achieve these goals, we
propose three specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will identify OLFML3 sensor/receptor or binding protein in microglia,
and determine its role in mediating OLFML3-induced microglial infiltration in CLOCK/BMAL1-high GBM. In Aim
2, we will determine the key microglial intracellular pathways that are responsible for OLFML1-induced microglial
migration and GBM progression. In Aim 3, we will investigate whether inhibition of microglial infiltration can
reverse primary resistance to immunotherapy in GBM, thus developing novel therapeutic strategies combining
inhibition of microglia infiltration with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We propose to employ integrated strategies
combining gain- and loss-of-function approaches, in vitro and in vivo systems, as well as proteomic and
transcriptomic analysis to test each Aim. Together, this project will uncover novel mechanisms for microglial
infiltration and reveal new immunotherapeutic strategies for GBM."

As the prevalence of obesity and associated disorders rises, manipulation of adipocyte energy expenditure has
gained attention as a potential means to treat metabolic disease. This strategy leverages the physiology of
thermogenic adipocytes, a cell type that relies on oxidative phosphorylation metabolism to drive futile chemical
cycles that release energy as heat. Recent work has suggested the potential for ribosomal control of
thermogenic gene expression. Elucidating the responsible mechanisms may reveal novel means to manipulate
adipocyte metabolism for the treatment of obesity and diabetes. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the
distinct metabolism of thermogenic fat is enabled by specialized mRNA translation preferences inherent in this
cell type. A first set of studies focuses on a single mRNA, PPARGC1A, and aims to purify the proteins that
confer its cell-type-specific translational output. This mRNA encodes PGC1α, a dominant regulator of
mitochondrial biogenesis. A second set of studies develops an in vivo mouse model to test the hypothesis that
the helicase DDX3X, a regulator of mRNA translation and cytoplasmic stress granules, is a thermogenic-fat-
selective translational regulator that supports expression of genes critical for oxidative metabolism. A third set
of studies uses ribosome profiling technology to define the global mRNA translation dynamics associated with
thermogenic activation. Together, these studies expand the scope of my work while generating foundational
datasets and mouse models for my scientific independence. They will be carried out in the lab of a recognized
leader in the field of molecular metabolism, Dr. Bruce Spiegelman, at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and
Harvard Medical School. In this rich environment, I will benefit from a mentorship team committed to instruct
me in: adipocyte biology, including in vivo genetic manipulation; mouse metabolic phenotyping; mass
spectrometry; and bioinformatics. The technical training is complemented by formal instruction in human
metabolic pathophysiology, as well as activities for honing my leadership, speaking, and writing skills. In this
way the NIH Pathway to Independence Award supports my transition from mentored work to an independent
stage in which I intend to use cutting-edge methods to broadly define the translational dynamics of
thermogenic fat, identify the responsible regulators, and test how post-transcriptional dynamics such as stress
granule assembly may contribute. My ultimate goal is to lead an academic research group that investigates
how the gene expression programs that define cellular identity and metabolism are established, how they are
perturbed in metabolic disease, and how they may be therapeutically manipulated to prevent or treat metabolic
disease."

The sheer genetic heterogeneity and complexity of cancer has been laid bare by next-generation sequencing
studies of cancer genomes. A major challenge in the post-genomic era of cancer biology is to move beyond
descriptive analyses of genomic data and derive functional insights into the complex multigenic interactions
that produce complicated phenotypes associated with cancer evolution. Available experimental systems are
poorly-suited to address this problem in a systematic and expeditious manner as they generally lack scale,
throughput, economy, or biological relevance. We therefore propose the development of a next-generation
functional cancer genomics assay that overcomes these limitations and will be employed here to define
complicated genotype-to-phenotype relationships in contexts related to prostate cancer initiation and
progression. The assay combines the efficient delivery of random, compound genetic perturbations from
barcoded lentiviral libraries encoding gain-of-function and/or loss-of-function events; biological selection for a
cancer phenotype; and single-cell sequencing analysis to enumerate lentiviral barcodes for the massively
parallel association of genotype with phenotype. The major goal of this project is to apply and advance this
pioneering strategy to broadly advance our understanding of prostate cancer biology by characterizing
compound genetic interactions that (1) transform benign prostate epithelial cells to cancer and establish
distinct cancer subtypes, (2) induce neuroendocrine transdifferentiation of prostate cancer, and (3) promote
metastatic dissemination. If successful, these studies will characterize and prioritize the functional contributions
of multigenic networks to clinically relevant prostate cancer phenotypes. We will also establish multiple new,
genetically-defined mouse models of prostate cancer that will better recapitulate the genetic complexity of the
human disease. Finally, we anticipate that the next-generation functional cancer genomics strategy will be a
flexible and widely applicable experimental tool to rapidly interrogate complex genetic interactions and their
impacts on phenotype in many other cancers."

 This five-year plan for a MOSAIC K99/R00 Postdoctoral Career Transition Award will equip Dr. Erica
O’Brien with essential knowledge and skills to help launch her career as an independent scientist in health-
focused aging research. This qualified candidate seeks to focus her research program on understanding the
psycho-social and social cognitive determinants, multi-factorial pathways, and temporal dynamics underlying
lifelong engagement in health-promoting behaviors and activities. The career development plan involves
scientific training at Pennsylvania State University’s College of Health and Human Development under the
mentorship of world-renowned experts in ecological momentary assessments, physical activity, aging/adult
development, and health behavior research. The proposed training will supplement Dr. O’Brien’s existing
background in studying age-related differences in cognitive engagement and in using diary designs with a
foundation in intensive longitudinal methods and technologies as well as in health behavior research.
 Physical activity (PA) serves as an important behavioral pathway to delayed functional decline, disease,
and mortality as well as to improved quality of life and psychological well-being in older age. Yet, many people
do not obtain the recommended levels of PA, with insufficient PA being more likely in older adults. Existing
studies increasingly indicate that people who believe that low PA reflects an expected and inevitable part of the
aging process report lower levels of PA engagement, but the pathways explaining this relationship are unclear.
Whereas theories of aging suggest that negative self-views of aging (NS-VOA) adopted earlier in life become
internalized and self-fulling later in life, health behavior theories emphasize the lack of motivation to engage in
PA and poor self-regulation of PA behavior as driving forces. Guided by these ideas, the proposed research
uses an intensive within-person approach to characterize the relationship and underlying mechanisms between
PA and NS-VOA as they unfold in daily life.
 K99 Years 1 and 2 will use existing data to address Aims 1 and 2. Aim 1 will characterize the extent of
within-person variation in NS-VOA, testing whether NS-VOA vary significantly on four timescales: years, weeks,
days, and moments (i.e., within-days). Aim 2 will examine the association between NS-VOA and PA on daily and
momentary timescales. It is hypothesized that PA engagement will be lower on occasions when NS-VOA are
higher than usual, with stronger relationships for higher (vs. lower) intensity PA and when device-based (vs. self-
reported) PA are used. Aims 1 and 2 are novel, within-person assessment contexts important for understanding
fast-acting relationships and underlying mechanisms. R00 Year 3 will collect and analyze new data for Aim 3 to
test whether NS-VOA act through motivation and self-regulation factors to influence PA on daily and momentary
timescales. This work will inform preparation and submission of an R-grant (R00 Years 4 and 5) that focuses on
prevention and intervention to increase older adults’ PA at key times when NS-VOA may impair PA engagement."
11130144,"Family caregivers provide much of the support to people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias
(ADRD) living in the community. As a result, caregivers for people with AD/ADRD may experience measurable declines
in financial well-being due to the costs of care, such as medical treatments and home modifications, or because of changes
to their employment status and income. These financial burdens are a particular concern for National Institute on Aging
(NIA) priority populations, including people who are Hispanic/Latino, Black/African American, or living in a rural area,
who experience racial and geographic disparities in economic well-being. However, no comprehensive measure of the
financial impacts of AD/ADRD care exists. Furthermore, few existing measures consider the caregiver’s broader social
network, even though they may impact the caregiver’s financial situation or experience indirect financial effects of care.
Therefore, the full extent of the financial impacts of AD/ADRD care on family caregivers and their social network
remains unknown. To address this gap, this study aims to: (1) Engage diverse family caregivers of people living with
AD/ADRD and their social network to identify areas of financial impact, (2) Develop and pilot a comprehensive
quantitative measure of the financial impact of caring for a person living with AD/ADRD, and (3) Validate a revised
measure of financial impact to accurately capture the experiences of caregivers of people living with AD/ADRD and their
networks. We will use a mixed methods approach incorporating interviews and surveys guided by the NIA Health
Disparities Framework and a family caregiving framework to identify both existing and novel areas of care-related
financial impacts. We will over-sample caregivers from three NIA priority populations: Hispanic/Latino, Black/African
American, and people living in rural areas. Drawing from best practices in survey design, we will engage with key
stakeholders including people with lived experience of AD/ADRD, clinicians, and researchers to develop candidate
measures. In partnership with an experienced survey research center, we will field an initial survey of 100 caregivers of
people with AD/ADRD, using both telephone and Internet surveys conducted in English and Spanish. We will use
exploratory factor analysis to evaluate the structure of the new measure and Rasch analysis to assess item redundancy and
adequacy of response options. Based on our quantitative results and additional feedback from stakeholders, we will revise
the measure and validate the instrument in an independent sample of 300 caregivers of people with AD/ADRD using the
same partnership and methods as the initial survey. The validation process will use confirmatory factor analysis, Rasch
analysis and other psychometric methods to assess the measure’s properties overall and within each of our three priority
populations. Our approach will result in a novel, validated measure of the unique financial impacts experienced by
caregivers of people with AD/ADRD. Our aims are designed to assure the measure is valid and reliable in the general
population and among Latino/Hispanic, Black/African American, and rural caregivers. Ultimately, this measure can be
used to better understand caregiving networks in AD/ADRD and will inform the development of interventions and
policies that will better support caregivers and families of people living with AD/ADRD."
11130265,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall
Antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern worldwide. This CARB (Combating Antibiotic Resistant
Bacteria) proposal was conceived in response to this urgent global threat. The theme of our program, “Exploiting
Membrane Targets to Overcome Antibiotic Resistance,” addresses important gaps in current knowledge to
facilitate translation of discoveries into strategies to combat antibiotic-resistant infections. A team of highly
collaborative and productive scientists from diverse fields – chemistry, biochemistry, structural biology, and
molecular genetics – has joined forces in this effort. The cell envelope, the interface between host and pathogen,
is a major point of vulnerability for bacteria. Interfering with cell envelope assembly or function can inhibit bacterial
growth, promote lysis, decrease resistance to host immune defenses, and increase susceptibility to other
antibiotics to overcome resistance. Identifying and exploiting new ways of disrupting envelope assembly
pathways to enable therapeutic discovery has been an important goal in the field. However, progress in this area
has been hampered by the many challenges posed by envelope targets. Biosynthetic and regulatory processes
that govern cell envelope biogenesis take place at a membrane interface and often involve proteins that contain
multiple membrane-spanning segments, function in multi-protein complexes, and use complicated substrates
that are not commercially available. Advancing our understanding of these cell envelope targets requires the
concerted efforts of an interdisciplinary team with expertise that spans broad areas of chemistry and biology.
Recent technological advances and biological discoveries, many made by the CARB project team, have
transformed our understanding of cell envelope biology and opened the door to fundamentally new approaches
to therapeutic targeting of this essential structure. To build on these successes, we have created a collaborative,
interdisciplinary project to identify, characterize, and validate novel vulnerabilities in envelope biogenesis and
maintenance pathways. The three proposed projects are not only connected by the shared focus of the
investigators on cell envelope biology, their commitment to molecular mechanism as the foundation of
translational research, and overlapping themes and goals, but also by synergistic collaboration among multiple
investigators within as well as between each proposal. Project 1 will define the structural basis for enzymatic
activity of the broadly conserved SEDS family cell wall polymerases and determine how SEDS proteins function
within large macromolecular complexes during growth and division. Project 2 will focus on identifying and
exploiting vulnerabilities in the Gram-positive cell envelope. Project 3 will focus on characterizing and exploiting
vulnerabilities in the Gram-negative cell envelope. A streamlined administrative core will coordinate activities to
maximize synergies, data sharing, and use of all program assets while providing responsible fiscal oversight."
10838596,"Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective antidepressant non-invasive brain stimulation
therapies for adults with major depression. However, a number of patients fail to respond despite adequate trials,
and while clinically beneficial, ECT can produce adverse cognitive effects including amnesia, executive
dysfunction, and verbal dysfluency. Previous single- and multi-site ECT-imaging investigations have been limited
by insufficient sample size and/or non-standardization of methodology. Therefore, in answer to NIMH Strategic
Objective 3.2 ""Develop strategies for tailoring existing interventions to optimize outcomes,"" our investigative
teams have conducted clinical studies to develop standardized methods for acute ECT course administration,
antidepressant and cognitive measures for phenotyping, optimal neuroimaging protocols and E-field modeling,
and sophisticated analytic models to integrate and interpret the antidepressant-response and cognitiveimpairment
biomarkers. In this prospective study we propose the first investigation integrating multiple units of
analysis including clinical and cognitive phenotyping, whole-brain neuroimaging, EEG, and E-field modeling to
establish the mechanisms underlying ECT-induced antidepressant response (response biomarkers) and
cognitive adverse effects (safety biomarkers), as well as to find the ""sweet spot"" of ECT dosing for optimal
antidepressant benefit and cognitive safety. Adult patients with major depressive disorder (n = 230) will receive
a standardized acute ECT course, complete clinical and cognitive measures and undergo structural and
functional MRI at three time points (baseline, after ECT tt6, and following treatment completion) and one-month
naturalistic follow-up. All MRI data will be processed and harmonized identically at a central imaging core to
ensure uniformity. We have three primary aims: 1) Determine the relationships between E-field strength, ictal
power, and biomarkers; 2) Determine the relationships between E-field strength, biomarkers, and antidepressant
outcomes; and 3) Determine the relationships between E-field strength, biomarkers, and cognitive outcomes. An
exploratory aim will contrast antidepressant-response and cognitive-impairment biomarlcers identified in the
current proposal with magnetic seizure therapy and healthy comparison subjects. The overarching hypothesis
of this investigation is that the E-field variability will explain antidepressant and cognitive outcomes.
Public Health Significance: Successful completion of this project will verify the optimal ECT dose (the ""sweet
spot'') of 112 Vim within the right hippocampus which can then inform precision and individualization of ECT
amplitude with ""E-field informed ECT"". The standardized algorithms for E-field modeling can be generalized and
widely disseminated. This proposal will result in a paradigm shift from ""trial and error"" approaches of ECT
parameter selection to individualized, precision dosing to improve patient outcomes.

The proposed five-year pragmatic trial em bedded in an existing program providing SNAP cross-enrollment
outreach and enrollment assistance program among 900,000 Michigan Medicaid beneficiaries. This project will
be conducted in partnership with Michigan Department of Health and Human Services and Benefits Data Trust
and with guidance from an Advisory Committee that includes people with disabilities. The proposed study will
leverage the program's random selection of households for treatment to estimate the effect of SNAP outreach
and enrollment assistance among low-income adults with disabilities. Households are randomly selected for
either an information-only arm or an information plus assistance arm while a 3""' equivalent group waits for
treatment, forming a wait-list control by default. Medicaid data from adults aged 18 and older will be used to
identify people with disabilities, defined for this study as individuals who: (a) receive disability benefits (e.g.
SSDI, or, if younger than age 65, SSI); (b) are Medicaid eligible due to disability or blindness; (c) are eligible fa
home and community-based services or (d) are home help recipients needing assistance with Activities of
Daily Living. Outcomes will be measured using Medicaid claims and SNAP utilization data. Aim 1 characterizes
Medicaid beneficiaries at baseline with disproportionately lower SNAP utilization (participation and benefit
amounts) for people with and without disabilities and examine interactions with race/ethnicity, age, and
presence of ambulatory care-sensitive conditions. Aim 2 evaluates the impact of a cross-benefit enrollment
intervention on health care utilization, including inpatient hospital and emergency department utilization
(emergency department visits; hospitalization and length of stay; end-of-the-month utilization; and utilization for
ambulatory care-sensitive conditions) and on nursing home utilization (admission and length of stay) among
community-dwelling adults with a disability. Aim 3 evaluates the impact of a cross-benefit enrollment
intervention on SNAP utilization (participation and benefit amounts) and tests SNAP utilization as a mediator of
intervention effectiveness health care utilization among community-dwelling adults with a disability. Aim 4 tests
for effect modification of intervention impact based on race/ethnicity, age, and presence of ambulatory caresensitive
conditions, among community-dwelling adults with a disability. Through these aims, this study
evaluates a promising new intervention that may increase food access for low-income adults with disabilities.
Results from this work are urgently needed to improve food access for low-income adults with disability and
advance health equity - two critical public health priorities."
11133739,"Disease associated with allergies such as asthma are a rising health problem with no current curative solutions.
CD4+ helper T cells (TH) that respond to common allergens play an important role in driving airway inflammation
in asthma. To better understand the diversity of T cell subsets in allergy and asthma, we analyzed the single-cell
transcriptome of ~50,000 house dust mite (HDM) allergen-reactive TH cells from asthmatics and non-asthmatics,
with and without HDM allergy. From our analysis, besides canonical clusters of cells such as TH2, TH17, and TH1,
we identified a novel subset of allergen-reactive TH cells characterized by an IFN responsive gene signature that
we called THIFNR cells (Seumois et al. Science Immunology, 2020). Proportions of THIFNR cells were
significantly increased in nonallergic individuals compared to allergic patients, suggesting an allergen-specific
host specific response even in non-allergic individuals. Moreover, the exclusive presence of the allergen-reactive
TH2 cells in the allergic patients suggests a protective role (anti-TH2 response) of the THIFNR cells in the non-
allergic patients with exposure to allergen. This potential protective role was reinforced by our in vitro studies
showing that TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) produced by THIFNR cells directly inhibits T cell
activation triggered by TCR engagement. In follow-up studies, we found THIFNR cells among viral-reactive TH
cells directed towards Flu or SARS-CoV2, suggesting a broader role of those cells in immune responses. Also,
we found THIFNR cells as a stable TH subset in a large cohort of healthy individuals. Because of the recent
discovery of THIFNR cells, very little is known about their origins, differentiation, phenotype, and function. We
hypothesize that these THIFNR HDM-reactive T cells could play a role through TRAIL engagement in dampening
TH2 inflammation in allergy and asthma.
In Aim 1, we will define the functional properties of THIFNR cells. We will perform co-culture experiments to test
the ability of THIFNR cells to inhibit proliferation and function of TH2 cells in a TRAIL-dependent manner. In Aim
2 we will determine optimal conditions to induce differentiation of THIFNR cells in vitro and compare their
functional properties with those generated in vivo. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine if HDM-reactive THIFNR
cells show persistence and plasticity in vivo. We will perform single-cell TCR sequencing of HDM-reactive
THIFNR cells and other memory CD4+ T cell subsets isolated from longitudinally collected blood samples of HDM
allergic and non-allergic subjects. By comparing TCR repertoire in longitudinal samples, we will assess
persistence of THIFNR cells in vivo. Overall, functional studies in this R21 program will provide important insights
into this novel CD4+ T cell subset; and form the basis of a future R01 application to conduct studies in vivo and
to translate findings to the clinic."
11133512,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Exercise capacity, also known as cardiorespiratory fitness, has emerged as one of the single best predictors of
health and longevity. Low exercise capacity is a strong risk factor for the development of cardiovascular
disease and overall mortality. Aerobic exercise training is the only effective treatment to increase exercise
capacity and reduce the health risks associated with low exercise capacity. However, even when levels of
physical activity are matched, exercise capacity remains lower in people with metabolic diseases such as Type
1 and Type 2 diabetes compared to those without metabolic disease, suggesting a phenotype of “low response
to training”. The goal of this investigation is to determine the mechanisms that contribute to low response to
training in metabolic disease, and develop treatment strategies to improve the response to exercise. Clinical
investigations and our data from animal models suggest that chronically high blood glucose levels (i.e.
hyperglycemia) may be a cause for low response to training by blunting beneficial adaptations that normally
occur with exercise in tissues like skeletal muscle. We hypothesize that hyperglycemia causes glycation and
accumulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in muscle, and in turn, these glucose-induced ECM alterations
can prevent tissue remodeling with exercise in 3 distinct ways: 1) Altering muscle signal transduction via a
newly discovered JNK/SMAD mechanical signaling axis; 2) Impairing the function of muscle progenitor and
endothelial cells; and 3) Reducing levels of circulating ECM remodeling proteins. One specific aim is to
determine whether blood glucose lowering treatments can improve exercise capacity and muscle remodeling in
response to exercise in animal models of metabolic disease. A second aim is to determine the cellular and
molecular mechanisms in muscle that contribute to low exercise response under conditions of hyperglycemia.
Finally, we will use advanced proteomic screening combined with in vitro methodology to identify circulating
mediators of low response to training in humans subjects. Hyperglycemia is becoming more common as rates
of metabolic disease rise globally. This may lead to a population that is increasingly resistant to improved
exercise capacity with training, and the associated reduction in health risk. Despite significant clinical evidence
linking chronic hyperglycemia to the “low-response to training” phenotype, little is known about the molecular
mechanisms underlying these associations. This project will significantly advance our understanding of the
mechanisms that cause low response to training in people with metabolic disease, and identify treatments to
improve exercise capacity, health span, and longevity."

Biomedical researchers need to identify novel disease genes and understand disease mechanisms; clinicians
need to diagnose diseases and optimize treatments. An improved understanding of the genetic basis of
disease helps achieve both goals. The Monarch Initiative makes this possible by integrating the fragmented
data landscape into the most comprehensive open collection of genotype-phenotype data in the world. Our
Knowledge Graph (KG) links together clinical, biomedical, and basic science research data spanning multiple
organisms, and supports reasoning across a wide range of organisms, body systems, and diseases. Monarch
has achieved demonstrable clinical and translational success using model organism data to perform rare
disease diagnosis and gene-to-disease discovery, and our resources have become global standards. In Phase
II, we integrated the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) into the UMLS; enhanced our variant prioritization
algorithms and Exomiser tool, which was applied to 30,000 patients in the National Health Service (UK);
developed the Biolink Model/API; released new ontologies (Mondo unified disease ontology, Unified
Phenotype Ontology (uPheno), and the Environmental Conditions and Treatments Ontology (ECTO)), raised
the number of harmonized data sources in our KG to 34; and overhauled our web Portal. We will leverage this
foundation to make Monarch more intuitive for a diversity of users and contexts in phase III as follows:
Augment the Monarch Portal with new visualizations and tools. Guided by user requirements, iterative
user testing, and feedback, we propose to enhance the user experience and Portal functionality, focusing our
work on improvements to Navigation, Visualization, and Query.
Evaluate, optimize, and enhance algorithms for disease diagnostics, cross-species inference, and
gene-disease discovery. We will develop a comprehensive, modular evaluation framework, ‘PhEval,’ that will
allow us to monitor the diagnostic yield and performance of cross-species inference as our ontologies and data
graphs evolve. This will assist basic science researchers and clinicians to reveal cross-species mechanistic
evidence and evaluate potential precision disease modeling strategies.
Disseminate computational tools, data, services, and tutorials to a broad translational community. We
will expand access to our KG to enable users to process the KG for different domains and use cases, through
simplified downloads, APIs, software libraries, R packages, Jupyter notebooks, and Dockerized resources,
along with training materials. This will better support bioinformaticians and other researchers in leveraging our
KG and phenotype data in their analyses.
The Monarch Initiative aims to significantly improve the utilization, accessibility, and value of animal
models for disease diagnosis and discovery."

11128930,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Parkinson disease dementia (PDD) – one of the Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) – is
associated with increased disability, mortality and healthcare costs among people with PD. The long term goal
of this research is to reduce disability and delay the onset of the ADRD PDD by enabling people at risk for
PDD to cope with cognitive decline to maintain daily function. Existing medical treatments for PD do not
prevent or treat cognitive impairment, so behavioral interventions that mitigate its negative functional
consequences and potentially delay or slow PDD are a top research priority. Unfortunately, the widely-used
process training approach to cognitive intervention (repetitive practice of tasks designed to challenge and
improve particular cognitive functions) has been unsuccessful in improving daily function and quality of life in
this population. To overcome this limitation, the investigators take a strategy training approach, teaching
targeted strategies that people can use in their everyday lives to circumvent cognitive deficits and accomplish
daily tasks. Strategy training is a practice standard for cognitive rehabilitation in brain injury and stroke, but its
application to PDD is novel. Moreover, the strategy training intervention developed for this study explicitly
focuses on generalization of training to daily function, an aspect that is critically lacking from many typical
strategy training approaches and from PD-related cognitive intervention research to date. This project
addresses prospective memory, or the ability to remember to execute delayed intentions at the appropriate
moment in the future. Good prospective memory is essential for independent living, employment, social
relationships, and compliance with important health behaviors. People at risk for PDD have prospective
memory deficits that relate to worse daily function and quality of life. Therefore, prospective memory
impairment is a relevant cognitive problem to address in this population. The primary objective of the current
project is to determine the efficacy of mechanistically-targeted strategy training on prospective memory among
people at risk for PDD (PD with subjective cognitive decline). It is a single-blind randomized controlled trial
comparing the effects of strategy training to the traditional process training approach on objective laboratory
prospective memory performance (Aim 1) and reported everyday prospective memory function (Aim 2).
Additional objectives are to investigate neural mechanisms of prospective memory impairment in PD (Aim 3)
and neural and behavioral predictors of prospective memory training response (Aim 4). This project leverages
participants, data and infrastructure from an existing longitudinal cohort of PD and control participants to
evaluate short-term and long-term training effects, neurobiological mechanisms, and predictors of treatment
response. This work will meet the pressing need for effective cognitive interventions that delay functional
impairment associated with PDD and will positively impact function and quality of life in this population."

trainee research focused on reducing the mortality and morbidity associated with: HIV/AIDS and associated
co-infections; noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer;
mental health; and maternal and child health and nutrition (MCHN). In addition to mentored research, training
will include didactic components to develop competency in rigorous research design and methods, evaluation
and analytic capacity, regulatory issues, and cross-cultural collaboration.
 The Program brings together leading academic research institutions with longstanding relationships in
LMICs in a variety of disciplines and with multidisciplinary research capacities. The inclusion of institutions that
have shown a historical commitment to educating students from groups underrepresented in biomedical
research is prioritized. The four U.S. academic research institutions that will anchor our consortium are:
Harvard University (Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health); Boston University (School of Public Health);
Northwestern University (Institute for Global Health, Feinberg School of Medicine); and the University of New
Mexico (School of Medicine, Center for Global Health).
 Our consortium’s partner LMIC research sites are 18 well-qualified institutions in 14 LMICs. These sites
have strong pre-existing relationships with the Program’s principal investigators and institutions and have
demonstrated capacity to provide outstanding mentored experiences. Specific Aims include:
AIM 1: Recruit a diverse pool of qualified U.S. predoctoral and U.S. and LMICS postdoctoral applicants;
including at least 17 trainees per year for Years 1-2 and 16 trainees per year for Years 3-5, for a minimum of
82 trainees over the award period; AIM 2: Deliver a comprehensive education and research support program,

11135124,"ABSTRACT
A single gene can give rise to several alternatively spliced protein isoforms (i.e., proteoforms) that acquire
cancer-promoting functions. These cancer-associated proteoforms, compared to their normal counterparts, can
exhibit differential binding to protein partners that lead to the “rewiring” of cellular networks. To derive insight
into cancer cellular systems, network biology tools, such as Cytoscape, has been developed to visualize and
analyze cancer from a network biology framework. However, the molecular diversity of proteoforms is not
reflected in cancer interactome models. A limitation to progress in this area is conceptually simple. In nearly all
biological network models, ‘nodes’ represent proteins and ‘edges’ connect pairs of proteins that exhibit a
functional interaction. This is a problem because a gene may have a canonical annotated function, but the
cancer-associated proteoform can exhibit entirely different functions. Rather than conflating all proteoforms into
one gene representation, in this proposal, the IMAT and ITCR team will create a formal representation of
proteoforms in a network biology framework, based on the Cytoscape eXchange (CX) schema that underlies

The Hybrid Rat Diversity Program (HRDP) at the Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) is
pleased to submit this administrative supplement for support during the current grant year
(ending January 31, 2025). The overall goal of the HRDP program is to extend the use of rat
models for clinical translation through establishing an animal resource and genomic dataset to
facilitate the translation of laboratory research to clinical relevance. The HRDP parent project
has successfully established ~80% of the panel, including the entire FXLE/LEXF recombinant
inbred panel and nearly all of the classic inbred strains. The HXB/BXH recombinant inbred
panel currently has only 14 strains available to the biomedical research community due to a
limited number of embryos available, challenges associated with the BN strain contribution to
rederivation attempts, and pathogen status of a subset of embryos and strains. This supplement
application proposes to complete the HXB/BXH recombinant inbred panel through the import of
17 rat strains from the Czech Academy of Sciences in Prague to the Medical College of
Wisconsin. Living colonies of the remaining HXB/BXH strains are available from Dr. Pravenec’s
lab at the Czech Academy of Sciences. However, these strains are on the verge of elimination
due to a lack of financial support and pending retirement of Dr. Pravenec. This supplement aims
to 1) to identify healthy, pathogen free rats for each of the 17 strains, 2) prepare and ship these
rats with a tracking system to ensure successful transfer of the strains, and 3) establish colonies
of these strains using quality control measure for health status and strain identity. The most
efficient and cost-effective approach to acquire these key HRDP strains is by importing
pathogen free rats from the Czech Republic to MCW. The rat strains and associated genomic
and phenotypic data will be made available to the research community."
11133672,"The hypothalamus is a hub for counteracting dangerously low blood glucose levels by stimulating the counterregulatory response (CRR) to subsequently restore normal blood glucose levels. We recently identified hypothalamic Adhesion G-protein coupled receptor L 1 (Adgrl1) as a glucose receptor involved in energy and glucose balance. Adgrl1 is necessary in mediating a glucose-inhibited response in the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) neurons. Our preliminary findings show that Adgrl1 in the VMH is sufficient to restore the CRR to hypoglycemia in otherwise global Adgrl1 knockout mice. Moreover, Adgrl1 deficiency specifically in the VMH causes an impairment in the glutamate responses to hypoglycemia. Remarkably, Adgrl1 mRNA is decreased in the VMH in mouse models of diabetes, a phenotype that may explain compromised CRR to hypoglycemia. Adgrl1-expressing neurons in the VMH demonstrate impaired neuronal activity following recurrent hypoglycemia. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize: Adgrl1 in the VMH is essential for eliciting the counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia and the reduced function of VMH-Adgrl1 contributes to hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure including compromised glutamatergic tone and impaired sympathoadrenal response. We will test the hypothesis with the following Aims: In Aim1, we will establish the contribution of VMH-Adgrl1 to eliciting the counterregulatory response to hypoglycemia. In Aim2, we will determine the involvement of VMH-Adgrl1 in regulating glutamatergic tone and adrenal sympathetic nerve activity in response to hypoglycemia to explain mechanisms underlying hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure. Altogether, this project will likely establish the contribution of the novel glucoreceptor Adgrl1 to counteracting hypoglycemia and attenuating hypoglycemia associated autonomic failure."

Caspases are cysteine proteases that control apoptotic cell death. Caspases are activated to kill cancerous
cells but, inhibiting caspases can prevent deleterious cell death in diseases like heart attack and stroke. Thus,
there has been significant interest in caspases as drug targets. This interest heightened further with the finding
that caspase-6 plays a central role in neurodegeneration. Unfortunately, no caspase-directed therapies are
on the market, primarily because work has focused on the active site, the most conserved region of the family.
It is clear that each caspase is regulated in a unique manner. A comprehensive understanding of which is
essential to achieve caspase-specific inhibition. Thus, our long-term project goal has been to define and ex-
ploit unique regulatory features for each apoptotic caspase.
Our pursuit of that goal has been successful. Due to our understanding of the unique features of each apop-
totic caspase, we developed an allosteric caspase-6 inhibitor that is more potent than any reported (33 nM)
and is also by far the most selective, preferring caspase-6 500-fold or more over all other caspases. This
selectivity was possible because the allosteric site we targeted is unique to caspase-6, locking it into a helical
conformation not attainable by any other caspase. It is gratifying that our intense and systematic study of
caspase regulation - cleavage state, conformational change, zinc binding and phosphorylation - culminated
in a structural understanding that enabled us to meet our goal of caspase-selective allosteric inhibition. We
are still working to understand the conformational transitions of caspase-6 between the helical and strand
state and to understand the impact of our caspase-6 inhibitor on that conformational equilibrium. These stud-
ies are only possible by using high-field NMR experiments. We have begun many of these studies by use of
NMR spectrometers at national facilities and the results are extremely promising. We have recently been
awarded funds from the Massachusetts Life Science Center for purchasing a new 800 MHz NMR for UMass
Amherst that is appropriate for our ongoing experiments. This will dramatically improve our ability to assess
the conformational sate of caspase-6 and ultimately of other caspases. The robust and reliable function of the
800 MHz NMR is dependent on cooling of the magnet with liquid Helium (He). Unfortunately, due to changes
in manufacturing of and availability of He-recovery systems, we are not able to purchase the expected He-
recovery system to support the functioning of the new UMass 800 MHz Bruker spectrometer and the NMR
experiments in the Hardy lab. This proposal is requests partial funding for a PICASSO He-recovery system
from Quantum Technologies Corp."

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections affect the lives of more than 296 million people who are chronically infected
with HBV and are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Every year approximately
820,000 people die due to HBV-related complications and currently there is no effective cure. The available
treatments include nucleoside analogs and interferon alpha (IFNα). In the case of IFNα treatment there is a 10%
cure. Even though this number is not satisfactory it proves that HBV cure is possible. The mechanisms by which
IFNα leads to a cure are still not well understood. HBV genotypes and mutations in the pre-core region that result
in HBV e antigen (HBeAg) negative serology, have been associated with different health risks in chronic HBV
and sensitivity to IFNα treatment. Chronicity of HBV infections is linked to the stability and maintenance of the
covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which is the nuclear form of the HBV genome. The goal for a functional
HBV cure relies on strategies that will either eliminate or inactivate the cccDNA. Therapies that are based on
nucleoside analogs do not target the cccDNA while the mechanisms by which IFNα blocks HBV replication are
not entirely understood in respect to the direct or indirect effects on the cccDNA. Several investigational direct
acting antivirals (DAAs) including capsid assembly modulators (CAMs) and antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs)
have emerged as possible components in future combination therapies with the hope that a finite treatment will
be sufficient by activating the immune system and targeting the cccDNA. Host factors are being also investigated
both for understanding the basic biology of HBV but also as possible therapeutic interventions. Our recent
advances in cell culture and animal models that are based on the use of primary human hepatocytes can now
be exploited and combined with multiomics approaches and novel CRISPR validation tools to discover host
restriction and host dependency factors in the context of chronic HBV infection. The impact of HBV genotypes
and mutants provides a great tool to determine differences in chronic HBV and in the context of treatment with
IFNα. Moreover, DAAs that lead to activation of innate immunity may be part of future combination therapies. In
all, these studies combine expertise from multiple fields with the goal of advancing our knowledge in virus-host
interactions and leading to curative therapies against chronic HBV."

Solid tumors are the most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)
T cells have revolutionized the care of relapsed and refractory B cell malignancies but have not yet mediated
substantial benefit for patients with solid tumors. CARs redirect the powerful anti-tumor activity of a T cell against
a tumor cell by targeting an antigen expressed on its surface. In solid cancers, most target antigens are shared
with normal, vital tissues, and therefore CARs can mediate dangerous and potentially fatal toxicity. This has
prevented widespread application of CAR T cells to solid tumors. The current generation of CAR T cells is unable
to differentiate between tumor tissue and normal tissue largely because they rely on a single input/single output
system that activates whenever the T cell finds its target. We have generated a novel mechanism to direct the
CAR T cell response only when multiple antigens are present, greatly enhancing our ability to generate a
programmed immunotherapeutic response against solid tumors. Optimization and application of this platform will
greatly enhance the number of potential targets for CAR T cells, a paradigm shifting technology poised to mediate
significant clinical benefit for patients with solid tumors. This strategy will also prove essential to effectively use
CAR T cells to treat other cancers, such as myeloid malignancies, and diseases as diverse as autoimmunity and
fibrosis. The novel system proposed here has the potential to redefine the landscape for programmable cellular
therapies."

Depressive symptoms are present in up to 40% of individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and an ongoing
debate regarding whether they represent a risk factor or a prodromal sign of AD. Chronic conditions such as
depression impact the stress response and may accelerate biological aging further contributing to susceptibility
to age-related conditions specifically cognitive decline. However, genetics of psychiatric traits and AD have been
mostly studied separately.
 This proposal aims to identify coding and non-coding regulatory variants associated with shared genetic
risk for depression and AD in multiple cohorts: UK biobank, Million Veteran Program, Alzheimer’s Disease
Sequencing Project, National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, and Yale-Penn study, and replicate
findings in PsycheMERGE, cumulatively studying more than 1 million individuals. We will assess two major risk
factors of AD - APOE-ε4 carrier status (Model-1) and parental history of AD (Model-2) with depression. Our
previous findings from the genetically regulated expression study of depression in 1.2 million individuals using
hippocampus-based expression quantitative trait loci (QTL) identified several genes which have roles in AD
pathology (e.g. PARK2, NEGR1, HSPA1A, ITPR3, NLGN1, and DRD2). Therefore, we hypothesize that
stratifying depression with AD phenotypes will uncover overlapping genetic contributions between depression
and AD and elucidate the shared molecular mechanisms, and potential therapeutic targets.
 To test theses hypotheses, this proposal aims to develop a multi-modal framework to study
neuropsychiatric comorbidities by investigating, Aim-1) whole exome profiles for coding regions associated with
depression and genetic risk for AD (K99 phase), Aim-2) transcriptomic profiles to identify a shared molecular
basis for depression and AD risk by integrating large-scale GWAS with brain tissue-based molecular QTL studies
(R00 phase), and Aim-3) epigenome profiles to identify methylation sites associated with a combined polygenic
score of depression and AD, and compare biological aging between depression and AD comorbidity, and either
disorder alone (R00 phase).
 The accompanying training includes didactic courses in i) data analysis from multiple high throughput
technologies, ii) developing biomarkers from large-scale datasets, iii) computational programming and iv)
gerontological studies. The professional development training will include writing workshops, building mentoring
portfolio, training opportunities to establish laboratory as an independent researcher. This training plan was
developed under advisory team comprised of five members who are experts in AD, psychiatry, aging, large-scale
genomics, and cohorts with electronic health records. Together they provide guidance on the proposed study
and support a multidisciplinary neuropsychiatric research career for the candidate."

Vascular composite allotransplantation (VCA) is the most immediately available therapy for individuals who
have suffered irreparable tissue damages or deformities. While the technical aspects of VCA have rapidly
advanced for these patients, the outcomes of VCA still lag behind those of other solid organ transplantation.
The dramatic difference in outcomes highlights the inadequacy of current immunosuppressive regimens in
VCA, which are largely borrowed from other organ transplantation, particularly kidney transplantation, where
patients are immunologically more naïve. The higher immunogenicity (or susceptibility to rejection) of VCA may
be attributed to (1) the inclusion of multiple tissues (i.e. muscle, skin, nerve etc.) in the transplant, (2) the
exclusive use of deceased donors for VCA, and (3) pre-transplant management of trauma including transfusion
prior to VCA. These factors will contribute to VCA rejection by expanding allo-specific immune cell repertoire,
priming innate cells (trained immunity), and sensitizing recipients, respectively.We have shown that targeting
the CD40/CD154 signaling pathway with anti-CD154mAb successfully promote long-term graft survival of
kidney allograft in naïve recipients. Furthermore, anti-CD154mAb showed superior efficacy in sensitized
recipients compared to tacrolimus-based conventional immunosuppression. Together with cytolytic induction,
anti-CD154mAb effectively prevented post-transplant humoral response, eliminated antibody-mediated
rejection (AMR) and significantly prolonged graft survival in sensitized recipients, all without introducing
additional viral complications or malignancy. Given its exceptional efficacy in organ transplantation, particularly
in sensitized recipients, we hypothesize that targeting the CD40/CD154 singling pathway can efficiently
regulate the host immune response following VCA, even in cases where recipient have been sensitized by
primary trauma care. This approach may create a therapeutic window to induce donor-specific tolerance. We
will evaluate anti-CD154mAb approach in combination with either apoptotic donor cells or complement
inhibition to re-establish an immune repertoire that favors transplantation tolerance. To explore this hypothesis,
we propose 3 specific aims: 1) To test the efficacy of anti-CD154mAb in a naïve and sensitized nonhuman
primate VCA models. 2) To determine efficacy of antigen-specific and non-specific pro-tolerance approaches in
NHP VCA recipients. 3) To identify the functional phenotype of allo-specific T and B cells repertoires required
to establish tolerance in VCA recipients."

Memory CD8+ T cells are essential adaptive effector cells of immune defenses because they are extremely
efficient at sensing intracellular pathogens and tumors. The chief effector feature of CD8+ T cells is their ability
to recognize and kill infected and “abnormal” cells but they also produce multiple effector cytokines and
chemokines that contribute to orchestrate protective immune responses. The cellular and molecular
mechanisms by which memory CD8+ T cells in vaccinated hosts are reactivated and mediate protection in vivo
are not well understood. Answering this question has the potential to lead to novel strategies to harness or
redirect the power of CD8+ T cells to the benefit of the host in many therapeutic contexts. Over the years, using
mice immunized with the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) as model, we have contributed
to show that during recall infection, vaccine-induced memory CD8+ T cells quickly sense sets of inflammatory
cytokines released from various antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which initiate a rapid effector program in the
memory CD8+ T cells. This includes notably the secretion of the potent immunomodulatory cytokine IFNγ which
further signals and activates microbicidal functions inside phagocytes, a necessary process for efficient
protection of vaccinated hosts. More recently, during this funding period, we further established that, in addition
to IFNγ, a set of three chemokines, CCL3, CCL4 and XCL1, produced concomitantly by the memory cells in
response to cognate antigen (Ag) stimulation, are also required to achieve vaccinated host protection. We
further demonstrated that these processes are spatially and temporally regulated, and that memory CD8+ T
cells arrest in innate clusters of monocytes, and act as “catalysts” of their microbicidal effector functions. The
next step of this work proposes to understand i) the genetic and epigenetic circuitry of cognate Ag-driven
reactivation of the memory CD8+ T cell in vivo, ii) the chemotactic mechanisms coordinating the early Ly6C+
monocytic response and iii) the roles of the IFN-induced guanylate binding protein 1 (GBP1) in monocytes
effector response. We use state of the art single cell approaches, intravital imaging, lentiviral engineering and
new reporter/conditional mouse models to investigate these questions. We anticipate that successful
completion of the proposed work will have a broad impact in the field of T cell biology, and vaccines, and
potentially important therapeutic implications."
11129972,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the top five deadliest cancers due to a lack of effective
treatment options. One hallmark of PDAC is the expansion of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs play
critical and complex roles in PDAC microenvironment to modulate tumor progression and therapeutic response.
The long-term objective of my research program is to determine the cellular origin, heterogeneity and function of
CAFs in pancreatic cancer. To identify the tissue origin of CAFs in PDAC, I performed lineage tracing
experiments using genetically engineered mouse models. The splanchnic mesenchyme is a particular type of
mesenchyme adjacent to the pancreatic epithelium during fetal development. My studies demonstrated that the
splanchnic mesenchyme is the fetal origin of CAFs in PDAC (Han et al, Nat Commun, in press). In this current
proposal, I aim to further investigate whether splanchnic-derived CAFs maintain certain molecular signatures of
their fetal progenitors. The Hedgehog pathway is a critical paracrine signal between the epithelium and
mesenchyme during fetal development and is reactivated during tumorigenesis of the pancreas. The Hedgehog
signal modulates PDAC progression, but its downstream targets in CAFs have not been identified. My graduate
study showed that transcription factors FOXF1 and GATA6 are downstream targets of the Hedgehog pathway
in the fetal splanchnic mesenchyme. My preliminary studies suggested that these factors are also expressed in
PDAC CAFs in a regionally distinct pattern within the tumor microenvironment. In Aim 1, I will determine whether
FOXF1/GATA6 patterning in CAFs is regulated by the Hedgehog pathway activity. Hedgehog agonist or
antagonist will be utilized in in vitro cell or organoid culture and in vivo mouse models. In Aim 2, I will determine
the function of FOXF1+ CAFs and GATA6+ CAFs in PDAC by deleting these genes specifically in CAFs both in
vitro and in vivo as well as in patient correlation studies. The completion of this study will provide critical insights
in PDAC CAF biology, including novel cellular heterogeneity defined by selective persistence of fetal signatures
in coordination with the epithelium, and certain fetal signatures playing tumor-suppressing roles in a non-cell
autonomous manner. Ultimately, such knowledge in tumor microenvironment may reveal critical targets and
therapeutic avenues to inhibit tumor progression and prolong PDAC patient survival. I received rigorous training
in developmental biology during my graduate study. Four years ago, I started my training in cancer biology as a
postdoctoral fellow in the Hollings Cancer Center. During the K99 phase, I aim to further enhance my expertise
in pancreatic cancer research and to acquire several additional skills, which are essential to launch my
independent research program during the R00 phase. I aspire to draw from paradigms in both embryology and
oncology to develop novel perspectives and to tackle fundamental biological questions."
11133358,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clinical disorders of fear and anxiety, including trauma- and stressor-related disorders, represent an enormous
public health burden. Unfortunately, cognitive-behavioral therapies, such as exposure therapy, that are aimed
at reducing pathological fear are vulnerable to relapse. This is particularly problematic for patients under high
levels of stress, which undermines exposure-based therapies by impairing extinction learning and promoting
fear relapse. Despite years of work elucidating the neural circuitry for extinction, the neural mechanisms
responsible for stress-induced extinction impairments remain poorly understood. In previous work on this
project, we established that stress recruits bottom-up neuromodulatory circuits that inhibit the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a brain area that is critical for extinction learning. We have now shown that that
noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) are critical for stress-induced extinction impairments, such
as the immediate shock deficit. Critically, chemogenetic activation of noradrenergic LC neurons induces
basolateral amygdala (BLA) hyperexcitability, which in turn drives feed-forward inhibition of the mPFC.
Preliminary data indicate that stress-sensitive corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the central
nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) drive extinction learning deficits. Based on this, we propose a novel hypothesis
that CEA-CRF+ neurons drive LC-NE projections to the BLA, which results in both BLA hyperexcitability and
impaired extinction learning. We propose three specific aims to test this hypothesis using a combination of in
vivo electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and intersectional opt0genetic manipulations in male and female rats.
The first specific aim examines whether CEA-CRF+ projections to the LC are necessary and sufficient for stress-
induced increases in BLA hyperexcitability and extinction learning deficits. The second specific aim examines
explores whether noradrenergic modulation of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the BLA regulates stress-
induced hyperexcitability and extinction deficits. Lastly, the third specific aim examines whether the BLA is
critical for transducing stress-induced activation of CEA-CRF+ and LC➙BLA circuits to undermine mPFC
activity and extinction learning. The outcomes of these aims will advance a novel circuit mechanism for stress-
induced extinction impairments. Understanding this mechanism will facilitate the development of novel
pharmacotherapeutic approaches that optimally engage mPFC circuits to promote extinction learning under
stress."

Urinary incontinence (UI) and difficulties with toilet training are significant and common challenges faced by children
and young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). For these
individuals, toileting problems can result in slower progress and lower overall success rates with toilet training compared
to their neurotypical same-aged peers, and a substantial negative impact on their independence and ability to participate in
educational and community settings. Unfortunately for many, these difficulties with incontinence can continue into
adulthood, creating physical and psychological quality of life barriers, such as physical discomfort, social isolation,
improper hygiene, and lowered self-confidence and independence. The available support tools for children struggling with
toilet training have not advanced significantly in decades, and there is an urgent need for approaches to help these
individuals achieve long-term successful toileting. In this work, a technological support tool will provide a proactive
solution to help with toilet training. By proactively alerting before an accident occurs, it is expected that the use will be
able to learn to recognize and attend to the sensation that triggers the alert. Further, a proactive response will reduce
accident risk, minimize associated embarrassment from accidents, and decrease the likelihood of developing toileting
averse behaviors. The project takes a multi-disciplinary approach, combining expertise from Electrical Engineering and
Special Education, in order to tackle two key aims. The first aim is to identify the highly population-dependent set of
needs and constraints for an ideal toileting support tool through engagement with key stakeholders (i.e., parents and
caregivers of children with ASD/IDD, care providers, educators, and clinical professionals) through focus groups and
survey-based questionnaires. The second aim is to design, implement, and pilot test a user-centered bladder monitor that
aims to uniquely provide a support tool to proactively alert of bladder fullness and support dignity and independence for
children and young adults with ASD/IDD and others suffering from UI. Built based on radiofrequency (RF)-based
technology, the bladder monitor is non-invasive and enables real-time, safe, and continuous measurement and monitoring
of the bladder state through a sensor array that is flexible, discreet, and wireless. The resulting monitor will meet the
diverse needs of this population and will be the first tool ever to provide a proactive alert when the bladder is approaching
full to support toilet training and avoid accidents. Initial validation testing will be conducted through electromagnetic
computational simulations and experimental demonstrations, followed by pilot testing with stakeholders to establish real
world feasibility and social validity, with expanded behavioral studies in individuals with ASD/IDD who have difficulties
with toilet training planned subsequently. Long-term, this device is envisioned to support the transition to independence
for children and young adults with ASD/IDD from diverse backgrounds for them to achieve a higher quality of life and
great participation in educational and community settings."

Original 5-year Project: The effectiveness of social buffering in regulating stress appears to
wane for a period with puberty at the same time that stress-reactivity increases and young
adolescents become more vulnerable to stress-related affective pathology. There is a dearth of
knowledge regarding the neural underpinnings of social buffering in children and the changes
with puberty. Two of the proposed experiments address this gap in knowledge. In addition, the
loss of social buffering effectiveness with puberty has been examined using cortisol as the
stress measure. All three proposed experiments will examine the pervasiveness of the effect by
examining autonomic, in addition to cortisol measures. Finally, the effectiveness of social
buffers during the peripubertal period has only been examined for social evaluative stressors.
The proposed experiments will also examine whether the loss of social buffering also extends to
threat stimuli and to situations in which two friends are both experiencing the stressful event
together. Participants will be 11-14 years old and Tanner staging by parent- and self-report will
index pubertal status. Our prior research uncovered the waning of the effectiveness of parents
to serve as social buffers of the HPA axis over the pubertal transition and the concomitant
failure of friends to “step in” as stress buffers. The proposed experiments are the logical
extension of this work. The results will have the potential to drive significant attention to the role
of developmental disruptions in social stress buffering as possible contributing factors in the rise
of affective problems in the early teen years. Administrative Supplement: Two of the studies
have been completed, a third study not proposed in the original application [administratively
approved] was conducted during the COVID-19 lockdown to create an on-line version of the
social evaluative stressor task to allow continued data collection for the non-imaging study. The
two imaging studies were shutdown and then severely hampered during the pandemic. We are,
thus, delayed in completing data collection and pre-processing for the 2nd imaging study. The
supplement will allow us to complete the work initially proposed."
11131465,"The All of Us Research Program has an explicit goal to enroll at least 1 million people from all communities to
reflect the rich diversity of our nation. To truly engage our broad national diversity, a specific focus on sexual
and gender minority (SGM) individuals is critical. Engaging SGM people will help ensure equitable
representation of the US population in All of Us, biological heterogeneity for high-quality discovery science, and
diverse input in All of Us-based research via citizen-scientists and traditional researchers. Our proposal aims to
engage SGM people on a national scale to help the All of Us Research Program realize its ambitious goals.
SGM people – including members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ)
communities – are everywhere, demographically diverse, and represent all segments of society.
SGM people account for an estimated 4.1% (~13 million people) of the US population. SGM individuals
compose an identity-based population that includes sexual minorities (individuals with a sexual orientation that
is not heterosexual) and gender minorities (individuals with a gender identity that is not congruent with their sex
assigned at birth). SGM communities share a common experience of social marginalization, legal
discrimination, political disenfranchisement, and familial rejection. Despite limited data, SGM people are
believed to live in nearly all counties in the United States, be a part of other underrepresented minority groups,
be in every socioeconomic stratum, and speak the diversity of languages in our nation. To examine this, we
recently analyzed all the last three years (2013-2015) of National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data
(manuscript under review) and found that self-identified lesbian, gay, and bisexual people were primarily
younger (28% were 18-29 years old, 17% were 30-39, 20% were 40-49, 26% were 50-64, and 9% were 65
years or older). Approximately 14% were of Hispanic ethnicity. Regarding race, 80% were Caucasian, 15%
were African/African-American, and 5% were another race. Approximately 30% reported an annual earned
income of $0 while 11% reported earning more than $75,000.
SGM people are largely invisible in federal population-based efforts because they are not counted.
Because sexual orientation and gender identity are not collected during the decennial US Census, the precise
number of SGM people in the US as well as their age, geographic, linguistic, race, ethnicity, income, and
regional distributions are unknown. Without these data, national population-based studies (e.g., National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, NHANES) are unable to generate sampling frames that adequately
account for the disproportionate geographic distribution of SGM people (e.g., San Francisco city census
reports that ~15% identify as SGM).
In 2010, the NIH commissioned the Institute of Medicine (now National Academy of Medicine) to study SGM
health to inform the nation’s SGM health research agenda. In addition to recommending research in nearly all
aspects of health, the consensus committee poignantly stated, “[t]he relative lack of population-based data
presents the greatest challenge to describing the health status and health-related needs of LGBT people” and
emphasized the need for national research efforts, such as All of Us, to explicitly include data measures or
questions about SGM identity. This report and other research led the National Center for Health Statistics to
include sexual orientation in the NHIS and the NIH to designate the SGM population as a “health disparity
population for research purposes” in October 2016.
SGM people are an underserved and understudied population that is vulnerable to poor health.
SGM people experience unique health and healthcare disparities including higher rates of smoking, HIV
infection, certain cancers, depression, suicide attempts, and delaying access to health care. Infrequent
collection of sexual orientation and gender identity data in clinical settings makes performing SGM-specific
studies challenging. Healthcare providers receive inadequate training in caring for SGM patients that often
results in mistreatment or discrimination, which deters research participation. While these inequities have been
associated with societal stigmatization and minority stress in small studies, difficulties identifying and studying
SGM communities severely hinder the identification of health disparity etiologies and the design of appropriate
interventions. By meaningfully including and engaging SGM people, the All of Us Research Program has the
potential to have a tremendous impact the health and well-being of millions."

disease. This application describes our next five-year plan to develop and distribute these essential NHP-
tailored reagents.
NHPs serve a crucial role in translational research, providing animal models for exploring the
pathogenesis of infectious and noninfectious diseases, and for testing biological therapies and vaccines.
Antibodies and biological reagents that target specific immune cells and biomarkers can be essential
tools in determining disease mechanisms. Additionally, immunomodulators that can be studied in vivo
serve as proof-of-concept for new therapies. While these crucial research tools are available for small
animal and human studies, substantial gaps exist for validated NHP research reagents. To overcome
this scarcity, for the past 21 years, the NHPRR has fulfilled critical needs within the scientific community
by developing, manufacturing and distributing NHP-specific reagents for in vitro diagnostics and for in
vivo use. Utilization of this resource has grown dramatically since this program’s inception. During the
last five years (2015-2019), we fulfilled 2,821 reagent requests for 320 investigators and distributed
~2,500 grams of recombinant antibodies for administration to NHPs.
By continuously availing ourselves of future scientific advances and technological improvements in
antibody development, engineering, expression and vectoring, we will keep supporting the scientific
community utilizing NHP models across all scientific disciplines."

 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by a progressive increase of pulmonary
vascular resistance and obliterative pulmonary vascular remodeling that result in right heart hypertrophy,
failure, and premature death. The underlying mechanisms of vascular remodeling and obliterative
vascular lesion formation remain unclear. Fatty acid metabolism dysfunction is linked to PAH. However,
the mechanistic role of fatty acid metabolism in regulating pulmonary vascular remodeling in the
pathogenesis of PAH has not been reported. We hypothesize that endothelial fatty acid-binding proteins
4 and 5 (FABP4-5) regulate endothelial glycolysis and arterial programming through HIF-2a/SOX17
signaling which contributes to severe vascular remodeling in the pathogenesis of PAH. We will 1) define
the novel role of endothelial FABP4-5 in the pathogenesis of PAH using multiple transgenic animal
models. 2) delineate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that FABP4-5 induces arterial programming
and pathogenesis of PAH. Completing our proposed study will provide a novel therapeutic strategy for
the effective treatment of PAH in patients."

A major goal of cancer research is to define the composition of the tumor micro-environment (TME) across
individuals. Once measured, differences in TME composition can be correlated with prognosis, targeted by
therapy, and used to test or generate novel therapeutic hypotheses. Our appreciation of TME complexity was
significantly advanced with the development of single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq). But scRNA-Seq
remains expensive, noisy at the level of single cells, and has a slow turn-around time (typically weeks). scRNA-
Seq also typically analyzes only 1000s of cells per sample. As a result, scRNA-Seq is not practical for deep
profiling of large patient or animal cohorts, or for routine hypothesis-testing in cancer research. Faster and
more scalable alternatives to scRNA-Seq are flow cytometry (FC) and Cytometry by Time of Flight (CyToF) but
these methods do not resolve the complexity seen in the TME by scRNA-Seq. Thus, there is an unmet need
for rapid, sensitive, highly-multiplexed TME profiling.
The focus of this grant is to address this unmet need by advancing a versatile and novel `micro-capsule'
technology. Capsules represent an evolution of droplet microfluidics, which is a mature technology for carrying
out single cell genomic assays in nanoliter-scale compartments, isolated by oil. Capsules overcome severe
technical limitations of water-in-oil droplets: their fragility to handling, and their complete isolation by immiscible
oil. By contrast, capsules are resilient, semi-permeable compartments that can be dispersed and processed in
any aqueous biological buffer. Prior to this proposal, we optimized capsules to retain cellular mRNA and DNA,
while simultaneously enabling rapid exchange of salts, enzymes, primers and probes with the surrounding
medium. We have now shown that capsules enable multi-step reactions and serial analyses on single cells and
specifically on surface proteins and mRNA molecules. This in turn enables rapid, versatile, highly-multiplexed
cytometry.
In this R33 we will benchmark and optimize two related capsule-derived methods: the first, “CapFlow”,
implements robust multiplexed mRNA flow cytometry with rapid capsule-based signal amplification. The
second, “CapCycle”, extends CapFlow to quantifying the abundance of ≥50 gene transcripts and cell surface
proteins, by replacing flow cytometry with cyclic imaging of immobilized capsules. With these methods,
capsules will enable sensitive, versatile, rapid, low-cost, highly-multiplexed phenotyping of tumor
heterogeneity. Thus, this proposal fills an important analytical gap, and develops a versatile microfluidic
technology with long-term potential to improve biological assays on single biomolecules and cells."

The circulating gasotransmitter H₂S is endogenously produced by tightly-regulated human enzymes and
exogenously produced in a diet-dependent manner by the human microbiota. Exogenous H2S production by
the human gut microbiota influences human health by modulating systemic H2S bioavailability. Excessive gut
microbial H2S production is hypothesized to be involved in the etiology of colorectal cancer and Ulcerative
Colitis. Our understanding of how gut microbially produced H₂S affects human health remains incomplete
because current measurement techniques are imprecise, invasive, require biospecimen collection, and have
limited temporal resolution. In this proposal, our objective is to address this gap by developing a research-
grade wearable Smart Underwear device that enables long-term real time measurements of gut microbial H₂S
production in gaseous rectal effluent (flatus). Flatus are an untapped source for measuring gut microbial H2S
production. We have demonstrated that the Smart Underwear v1 prototype can precisely measure
physiologically-relevant concentrations of H2S in vitro. When worn by humans, the Smart Underwear v1
prototype detects flatus with an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and is able to estimate the concentration of H2S
in each flatus. In the R21 phase, we propose to develop a second revision Smart Underwear prototype for
clinical trials through miniaturization, software development, and incorporation of flexible materials. In addition,
we propose to conduct a user experience trial to gauge the user acceptance and test the reliability of the Smart
Underwear device when worn by humans. In the R33 phase, we will use the Smart Underwear v2 prototype
developed in the R21 phase to test the hypothesis that the Smart Underwear device can detect diet-induced
alterations in gut microbial H2S production using a randomized controlled feeding trial that contrasts gut
microbial H₂S production by modulating dietary cysteine intake. The completion of the proposed goals will lead
to the first wearable device that enables long-term real time measurements of gut microbial H2S production.
This will facilitate the design of personalized dietary interventions to rationally modulate gut microbial H₂S
production and benefit future studies seeking to untangle the complex interactions between gut microbial H2S
production and disease."

The purpose of this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence award is to enable Dr. Sartin to gain the experience and
skills necessary to become an independent investigator focused on identifying, understanding, and eliminating
disparities in transportation and pediatric unintentional injuries. Dr. Sartin’s primary objective is to utilize a
breadth-to-depth approach that integrates knowledge obtained from population- (breadth) and individual-level
(depth) analyses to understand where and why racial and ethnic disparities in child occupant safety arise across
the crash injury continuum. In the K99 phase of this project, Dr. Sartin will complete multiple research and training
activities to develop knowledge and skills in: (1) advanced epidemiologic/statistical and injury methodologies; (2)
management, analysis, and visualization of large databases; (3) advanced R programming; and (4) effective and
ethical approaches to researching health disparities. Specifically, Dr. Sartin will complete structured coursework
and guided independent study, as well as mentored research with her experienced, interdisciplinary team of
mentors and advisors to successfully achieve three aims. In the K99 phase, Dr. Sartin will utilize innovative
methods to: analyze a large, unique source of state-level data to determine population-level frequency of child
restraint system use across racial/ethnic populations (Aim 1a); identify factors that contribute to lower rates of
child restraint system use in minority groups (Aim 1b); and assess how child, driver, and vehicle characteristics
impact racial and ethnic disparities observed in child occupants’ crash injury severity (Aim 2). In the R00 phase,
Dr. Sartin will recruit recently crash-injured children and a caregiver to participate in a mixed-methods, pilot
cohort study—involving surveys, clinical assessments, and semi-structured interviews—to assess short- and
long-term mental and physical health outcomes (Aim 3). Findings of the R00 study will serve as preliminary data
to support Dr. Sartin’s first R01 proposal. In addition to preparing Dr. Sartin for an independent research career,
this work is significant in that it will directly address several critical gaps in child occupant safety. While overall
child occupant fatality rates have decreased since 1975, ~3 children die in crashes each day and ~100k more
are treated each year in emergency departments for injuries. Further, while overall fatalities have declined, racial
and ethnic disparities have widened such that Black children are twice as likely as White children to die in a
crash. The high burden and costs of crashes on children ($530M annually) coupled with clear disparities
underscore the critical need to enhance child occupant safety, in particular among racial and ethnic minorities.
The knowledge gained by this project will ultimately reduce overall rates of pediatric crash injury and death by
bolstering protective efforts for the most vulnerable children. This K99/R00 is directly aligned with the NICHD
2020 Strategic Plan’s emphasis to understand the contribution of social, economic, structural, and regional
factors that contribute to health disparities, and the Pediatric Trauma and Critical Illness Branch’s mission to
prevent, treat, and reduce all forms of traumatic injury across the continuum of care."

This proposal seeks continued support for the UCSF Asthma and Allergic Diseases Cooperative Research
Center’s longstanding and productive efforts to understand how type 2 immune responses in the airway act on
epithelial cells to produce muco-obstructive pathology, a central feature of severe asthma and a major contributor
to fatality from this disease. Our Center has made major contributions to identifying type 2 high asthma as the
major asthma endotype, demonstrating that the type 2 cytokine IL-13 acts directly on airway epithelial cells to
induce pathological changes in mucus, and showing that mucus plugging is a persistent feature of asthma that
is associated with type 2 responses and with increased asthma severity. The overall objective of this proposal is
to understand molecular mechanisms that account for alterations in secretory cell and mucus function that are
important in severe asthma. The overarching hypothesis that serves as the focus of this renewal is that local
type 2 immune responses induce IL-13-mediated changes in epithelial gene expression and that these changes,
which involve several novel molecular mechanisms not previously explored, alter differentiation of secretory cells
and production and secretion of mucins, leading to mucus plugging and airway obstruction. The proposal
includes two highly related projects, each of which focuses on molecules and pathways that have previously
unknown roles in secretory cell biology and mucus dysfunction. Project 1 will determine the roles of the
tetraspanin TSPAN8, which we recently found to be required for stimulated release of MUC5AC, the major
component of mucus plugs, and investigate the contributions of cysteine proteases and cystatin inhibitors
implicated in our preliminary studies of mucociliary clearance in IL-13-stimulated primary human bronchial
epithelial cells (HBECs). In addition, project 1 will directly assess the relationships between type 2 immune
responses, epithelial alterations, and mucus plugging by analyzing lung tissue and HBECs from individuals with
asthma and controls. Project 2 focuses on understanding new findings showing key roles for airway epithelial
miRNAs in the miR-141/200 family and particular portions of the ER stress response in secretory cell
differentiation, pathologic mucus production, and mucus plugging in asthma. Every aim of both projects depends
upon a Clinical Subject and Biospecimen Processing and Analysis Core that will study banked lung specimens
(for detailed molecular studies of mucus plugs, including from fatal asthma), conduct a new bronchoscopy-based
study to obtain freshly isolated cells, provide banked human bronchial epithelial cells, and store, analyze, and
disseminate data. The Administrative Core will coordinate our Center and our interactions with other AADCRCs
and NIAID. The proposed studies will provide new mechanistic insights that are highly relevant to the
pathogenesis of severe asthma and may lead to novel therapeutic targets that address unmet needs."
11134863,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Genetic predisposition is a significant risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), the leading cause of
mortality. Most CAD risk variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are in noncoding
DNA, which poses a major challenge in identifying the target genes in the disease-critical cell types. Using the
Activity-by-Contact Model to predict cell type-specific gene-enhancer pairs, we identified cis-regulatory
elements in the chromosome 10q23 locus harboring multiple CAD-risk variants. Our preliminary studies show
that these enhancers in the 10q23 locus regulate tetraspanin 14 (TSPAN14) gene expression, specifically in
vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and monocytes. We have established strong population genetics evidence that
higher TSPAN14 expression reduces CAD risk and there is a consistent protective effect for the minor alleles
at the lead variants. TSPAN14 is an adaptor protein that aids in trafficking proteins like ADAM10, a Notch
receptor activator, to the plasma membrane. The role of Notch pathway activation imparted by this TSPAN14-
ADAM10 interaction in CAD pathogenesis has not been explored. In addition, we performed RNA-seq and
identified differentially expressed genes in TSPAN14-deficient cells that will help discover Notch-independent
TSPAN14 functions. These findings provide a premise for the central hypothesis that the genetic regulation of
TSPAN14 by variations in the 10q23 enhancer sequences affects CAD pathogenesis through Notch-
dependent and -independent mechanisms in vascular ECs and monocytes. In Aim 1, Dr. Lee-Kim will
determine the cell type-specific effect of 10q23 enhancer sequence variations on TSPAN14 expression
regulation. In Aim 2, she will determine the Notch-dependent effects of TSPAN14 expression in vascular and
immune cells. In Aim 3, she will characterize the Notch-independent TSPAN14 functions in vascular and
immune cells. The results from these studies will functionally validate the gene target for noncoding variants
associated with CAD-risk in the disease-relevant cell types and elucidate how TSPAN14 functions in CAD
pathogenesis. These studies will be conducted under the supervision of mentors, Dr. Rajat Gupta and Dr.
Stephen Blacklow, and an advisory committee dedicated to Dr. Lee-Kim’s success. With additional support
from the MOSAIC UE5 awardee sponsored professional development opportunities, continued training in the
K99 phase will prepare Dr. Lee-Kim for successful transition to independence."
11158472,"Myelin mechanisms of brain synaptic dysfunction in breast cancer therapy survivors. Breast cancer 
therapy, particularly chemotherapy involving doxorubicin (DOX), negatively impacts brain health, leading to 
cognitive deficits in over 75% of survivors. These cognitive difficulties encompass learning, memory, executive 
function, and psychomotor speed, affecting daily functioning. Chemotherapy disrupts neuronal metabolism, 
myelin formation, and neuroplasticity. While the functional detriments associated with DOX-chemotherapy are 
clinically obvious, the very nature of chemotherapy-induced changes in myelin-related synaptic health across 
the brain remains elusive. Recent research has observed that structural integrity (measured by diffusion 
fraction of anisotropy) and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) are both reduced bilaterally in the posterior cingulate gyrus 
of breast chemotherapy patients, and total creatine (tCr) is abnormally reduced in these same areas. Separate 
studies performed in breast cancer survivors also report that (i) the cingulate cortex shows reduced function 
during task and at rest and (ii) myelin fractions are lower in the cingulate’s interconnecting white matter (e.g., 
cingulum bundle, prefrontal, thalamic radiations). Given the primal role the cingulate cortex plays in cognition, 
these findings indicate that myelin-related synaptic dysfunction may play a mechanistic role in cancer therapy 
induced cognitive impairments. Investigating this further is a necessary step to the development of preventive 
and regenerative interventions. Despite the understanding that activity-dependent myelination is a known 
mechanism of adult brain plasticity that is reported to restore function in other conditions of aplastic 
myelination, this knowledge cannot be implemented in breast chemotherapy patients until more is known about 
treatment’s effects on synaptic health. The overall objective of this proposal is to investigate the alterations in 
synaptic health that occur in breast cancer survivors to inform possible future mitigation strategies. Our central 
hypothesis posits that cognitive impairments post-chemotherapy correlate with reduced NAA and myelination 
loss, which in turn leads to lasting deficits. The study plans to measure molecular markers of synaptic health, 
myelination integrity, and neurocognitive function in a longitudinal study of DOX-treated breast cancer patients 
to understand these relationships and elucidate possible future mitigation strategies. Our aims include: (1) 
Characterize synaptic dysfunction across brain networks of cognition post-cancer treatment; (2) Characterize 
myelination health across brain networks of cognition; and (3) Investigate the association between myelinrelated 
synaptic dysfunction and cognitive function. Overall, this research aims to shed light on the 
mechanisms behind cognitive impairments in breast cancer survivors."
11158473,"The incidence of breast cancer among young women between the ages 18 – 50 is increasing 0.5% each year. 
Simultaneously, due to advances in treatment, five-year survival rates are up to 86%. As these young women 
complete treatment and successfully transition into survivorship, they face significant changes to their physical, 
emotional, and sexual selves. Challenges such as decreased sexual functioning, menopausal symptoms, and 
body image changes due to treatment (chemotherapy, radiation, surgical intervention) are major concerns for 
young women in survivorship, but previous research has indicated that young women often receive little to no 
sexual health communication from their oncology providers. The resulting lack and/or absence of sexual health 
communication can lead to lower sexual health satisfaction and quality of life in survivorship. Many clinical 
efforts exist to provide breast cancer survivors’ sexual health education, yet few programs have been 
rigorously evaluated for efficacy and effectiveness. One program, EMBRACE (Empowerment through Mind 
and Body Reclamation After Cancer Experience) is a long-standing, nurse-led clinical sexual health 
psychoeducational intervention that was developed and implemented in two large cancer centers for more than 
eight years. The goal of this proposed study is to determine feasibility and establish efficacy of the online 
EMBRACE intervention to improve sexual health for young breast cancer survivors through two aims. We will 
recruit 42 young women breast cancer survivors who completed active breast cancer treatment and are 
currently on estrogen-suppression medications. In this pilot trial, participants will be randomized into two 
groups: the EMBRACE Group with an immediate start and the Delayed EMBRACE group which will begin 8 
weeks after enrollment per wait list protocols. For Aim 1, we will evaluate the feasibility of delivering EMBRACE 
in an online, private setting. For Aim 2, we will explore the preliminary efficacy of EMBRACE with vaginal 
rehydration and dilation on improving sexual health (menopausal symptoms, sexual functioning, and body 
image). The results from this study will provide an innovative approach to improve and possibly alleviate sexual 
side effects caused by breast cancer therapies for women in survivorship."

 Many cancer patients and survivors suffer from adverse effects due to treatment that can arise both during 
and after the completion of cancer therapy. The COBRE Center for Studies of Host Response to Cancer Therapy 
supports investigators from various disciplines who 1) research the mechanisms by which cancer therapy causes 
adverse effects, 2) identify new methods for detecting side effects sooner, and 3) develop novel strategies to 
prevent or reduce side effects. The purpose of the Administrative Core (Core A) is to build a self-sustaining 
research Center by maximizing opportunities for investigators to succeed and by promoting interactions and 
synergy within the Center and with other research units in the institution. Core A will provide an efficient, 
integrated administrative infrastructure for the COBRE Center (Aim 1), accelerate scientific growth through 
faculty development and scientific advising (Aim 2), and expand and advance the Center toward self- 
sustainability (Aim 3). A primary function of the core is to provide administrative support for project leaders and 
to manage financial affairs for the Center as a whole. Core A ensures there is effective communication within 
and among the projects and cores. Additionally, the core provides the infrastructure for scientific advising and 
faculty development, which will encourage scientific progress for project leaders and will help integrate their 
efforts with those of other scientists on campus. With assistance of the External Advisory Committee, new project 
leaders will be recruited and selected to replace those who graduate from COBRE advisee status. The Center 
also will perform a systematic, objective evaluation of activities, project leaders and their research, scientific 
advising and faculty development programs, and core functions. This strategy will ensure the long-term success 
of the Center as an independent but well-integrated investigative unit on campus with a vibrant and synergistic 
research environment that comprehensively addresses the short-term and long-term side effects of cancer 
therapy."
11129167,"Abstract
The global control of TB is compounded by co-infection with HIV. Those infected with HIV are at high risk of
reactivating latent TB infection (LTBI). Decades of research has not yielded a successful vaccine for the TB/HIV
syndemic. While therapeutics control Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and HIV burden, they have a potential
disadvantage of selecting for resistance and not rescuing from the immune dysfunction. Targeting the host
immune response via a host-directed immunotherapy (HDT) provides an opportunity to augment immunity during
the short-window of acute HIV-1 co-infection of Mtb. Treatment of LTBI in people living with HIV (PLHIV) reduces
the risk of active TB by only 35% and is dependent on the CD4 counts at the time of initiation.
 Though combinatorial antiretroviral therapy (cART) concurrently given with anti-TB therapy improves the
clinical and microbiological parameters, it leads to insufficient reconstitution of protective TH1, TH17 and CD4+ TEM
levels in the lungs and fails to rescue from virus-driven immune activation. Additionally, the long-term sterilization
of bacteria and immune reconstitution in the lungs has not been shown in the individuals treated concurrently
with cART and 3HP. HIV infection depletes IL-21 producing CD4+ T cells and cART only partially restores IL-21
in humans. We hypothesize that supplementing cART and once-weekly, three-month isoniazid and rifapentine
(3HP) treatment with IL-21-IgFc fusion protein in Mtb/SIV co-infection will result in a long-term reconstitution of
TH1 response and functional CD4+T effector memory (TEM) response in the lung. Further, IL-21-IgFc fusion protein
adjunctive to cART and 3HP, will augment cytotoxic function of NK cells, thus significantly reducing the likeliness
of LTBI reactivation in Mtb/SIV co-infection.
 Hence, we aim to explore a HDT that utilizes IL-21-IgFc fusion protein supplementation of cART+3HP
to mitigate virus-driven immune dysregulation and thus reduce incidence of LTBI reactivation. By concurrently
treating Mtb/SIV co-infected macaques with cART+3HP+IL-21-IgFc fusion protein, our goal is to significantly
reduce LTBI reactivation by providing long-term immune reconstitution concurrent to bacterial control by i)
induction of an adequate TH1 response via STAT1, ii) generation of CD4+ TEM cells, iii) maintenance of TH17
responses via STAT3 and iv) promotion of cytotoxic function of NK cells.
 The significance of our novel, translational approach is underscored by our strong preliminary data, and
a reproducible, human-like model system. The data from the proposed study will be critical to the development
of an immune-based intervention along with cART and anti-TB therapy to control dysregulated immune
responses generated during early events of HIV co-infection of LTBI and provide long-term immune
reconstitution. This will lead to the future clinical testing of such host-directed therapeutic approaches to control
TB/HIV co-infection related mortality and morbidities."
11129173,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
There are more than 38 million people living with HIV-1 infection worldwide, and more than 1.1 million in the
United States. HIV-1 acute infection and latency reversal are both dependent on viral expression of full-length
unspliced viral RNAs (US-vRNAs) that serve dual roles in the cytoplasm as either (1) viral mRNAs encoding Gag
and Gag-Pol proteins that drive virus particle assembly or (2) viral RNA genome substrates bound by Gag/Gag-
Pol for packaging into virions. This project combines live cell and superresolution imaging, biochemical assays,
and other research tools to address key foundational issues in HIV-1 US-vRNA nuclear export and virion
assembly relevant to informing the development of new antiviral strategies to target these crucial stages.
Aim 1 will define where and when in the nucleus US-vRNAs interface with viral and cellular components of the
nuclear export machinery. Our preliminary data have demonstrated surprisingly little overlap between the
subcellular trafficking behaviors of retroviral US-vRNAs and the Rev and Rex proteins that mediate their nuclear
export through the cellular Exportin-1 (XPO1, also known as CRM1) nuclear export pathway. We will test the
hypothesis that key interactions between HIV-1 Rev and US-vRNAs are highly transient, using single molecule
detection coupled to an innovative “cell expansion” superresolution light microscopy technique. Our goal is to
precisely define the subnuclear sites of Rev-US-vRNA and Rev-XPO1 interaction and study the effects of
prescribed perturbations to Rev function on these essential processes.
Based on our progress from prior studies of a species-specific block to Rev function in mouse cells, Aim 2 will
determine why nuclear Rev-US-vRNA complexes need to recruit multiple XPO1 proteins to achieve efficient
nuclear export. We will test the hypothesis that Rev drives XPO1 dimerization in human cells but not mouse cells
and attempt to achieve cell-intrinsic resistance to HIV-1 in human CD4+ T cells by inactivation of the putative
species-specific XPO1 multimerization domain using precision gene editing.
For Aim 3, we will use live cell imaging to test the hypothesis that Rev-dependent nuclear export licenses viral
RNAs for enhanced stability and genome packaging in the cytoplasm. These experiments will take advantage of
newly described mutant forms of HIV-1 that allow us to, for the first time, study US-vRNAs programmed for either
translation or packaging independently.
Collectively, these studies will provide new mechanistic insights into the viral and cellular machines that drive
HIV-1 genome trafficking, advance the development of new cell-based assays and imaging technologies for
studying HIV-host interactions, and test translationally relevant strategies for the targeted inactivation of HIV-1
genomes in vivo."
11129179,"Background. Alcohol use is a significant risk factor of disability and death for U.S. adults and one out of every
six Veteran seen in primary care (PC) report unhealthy alcohol use. Unhealthy drinking is associated with
increased risk for poor medical outcomes, substantial societal costs, and death, including suicide. Based on
substantial evidence from randomized controlled trials and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, VA/DoD
clinical guidelines stipulate that all Veterans screening positive for unhealthy alcohol use should receive
evidence-based alcohol care in PC, including brief counseling interventions (BI) and additional treatment (e.g.,
pharmacotherapy) for those with alcohol use disorders (AUD). The VA was a pioneer in implementing alcohol
screening and BI in PC, yet substantial implementation gaps remain. Approximately 25% of Veterans with
unhealthy alcohol use still do not receive BIs and evidence suggests that the quality of BIs is lacking. For those
with AUD, BI implementation has not appeared to increase access to recommended services (e.g., referrals) nor
reduced barriers to pharmacotherapy. In order to improve the quality and fidelity of alcohol-related care, the
current research proposes to use an evidence-based implementation strategy, practice facilitation, at one VA to
pilot test whether practice facilitation has the potential to improve quality of PC-based alcohol-related care.
Significance/Impact. This research directly addresses one of the largest public health crises of our time, as
alcohol kills more people than opioids and is associated with increased risk of suicide. Thus, this work may have
far-reaching effects on adverse outcomes experienced by Veterans and is aligned with top HSRD and VA
priorities, including increased access to care and suicide prevention. Innovation. The project will use innovative
implementation techniques not previously used to improve VA alcohol-related care. Specific Aims. Aim 1 is a
qualitative study assessing Veteran and PC stakeholders to understand barriers and facilitators to high-quality
alcohol care and use results to refine and hone the practice facilitation intervention. Aim 2 will deliver the practice
facilitation intervention in a small PC sample to examine its acceptability and feasibility. Aim 3 is a pilot test of
the practice facilitation intervention in the full PC clinic to understand whether practice facilitation improves quality
of PC-based alcohol-related care. Methodology. Aim 1 will recruit and interview Veterans with unhealthy alcohol
use (n=20-25) and PC stakeholders (N=10-15) to help refine the practice facilitation. Aim 2 will deliver the
practice facilitation among a small sample of PC providers and staff (n=5-7) to assess acceptability/feasibility. In
Aim 3, PC providers/staff from the full clinic will be invited to participate in the practice facilitation in order to
assess implementation (e.g., reach) and effectiveness (reduced drinking) outcomes. Implementation/Next
Steps. Findings will be presented to local and national operational partners and used to improve evidence-based
alcohol-related care nationally across VA PC. Candidate. Dr. Rachel Bachrach is a clinical psychologist and
postdoctoral research fellow in the Interprofessional Advanced Fellowship in Addiction Treatment based within
the Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion (CHERP), a VA HSR&D Research Center of Excellence.
The purpose of this CDA-2 is to facilitate Dr. Bachrach’s transition to an independent HSR&D investigator with
a long-term objective of improving evidence-based care for addictive disorders. The short-term objective is to
obtain formal training, expert mentorship, and research experience to facilitate a VA HSR&D career focused on
improving prevention and intervention efforts within PC for Veterans who screen positive for unhealthy alcohol
use. Mentorship will provide focused training on goals relevant for both the current CDA-2 research project and
for Dr. Bachrach’s career as an independent scientist, including in-depth training in (1) implementation science;
(2) alcohol-related care; (3) qualitative methods for intervention development; and (4) intervention design and
evaluation."
11129551,"Climate change has multiple pathways to directly and indirectly impact human health. There is a strong
connection between global warming and agricultural crops production through low precipitation, high

health through the Global Center for Climate Change and Water Energy Food and Health Systems
(GC3WEFH) in rural Jordan. We are bringing together a large and diverse group of scientists to develop
solutions and potential policies and interventions to help vulnerable populations cope with climate change

water quality and quantity with new data and focus on dietary quality and quantity. We established a robust
team of scientists and community engagement of residents in the municipality of Alkhaldyia in Northern Jordan
to address water access through an intervention of water desalination. This supplement will extend this effort to
understand diet quality and food security within this same community and its relation to water and
noncommunicable diseases in the context of climate change. We will recruit up to 100 homes from the target
population and 1) measure nutrient adequacy, sources, and dietary quality of consumed food as risk factors for
noncommunicable diseases; 2) determine if farming communities have adequate access to food and the level
of food insecurity among these impoverished communities; and 3) include the collected dietary data into the
WEFH modeling and tradeoff analysis that is being developed by the parent GC3WEFH project. We will
expand our team to include expertise in clinical nutrition and train graduate students to apply methods of food
assessment at the population level to be included in the parent grant’s Water-Energy-Food-Health nexus. The
supplement will provide insight into the complex climate-agriculture-food-nutrition-health context and in relation
to climate change impacts of low quality and quantity of drinking water. We have data collected on water use

10744738,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
The primary purpose of this project is to develop new metrics and mechanisms for the evaluation of
conflicts of interest (COI) risks in the biomedical research enterprise. The innovation in COI risk
evaluation and communication will draw on a shift away from the conceptualization of COI as a problem
of individual researchers toward an understanding of COI as network phenomena. The pressing problems
of COI and the bias it inculcates stem not from individuals but from the aggregation of COI across
networks of researchers and funders. The research team will leverage machine-learning and high
performance computing to (1) track the circulation of COI within biomedical decision networks, and (2)
evaluate the extent to which certain conflict network profiles predict increased risks of patient harm. The
team will test candidate COI metrics with U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Events
Reporting System drug safety data. Using these data as a foundation, this project will also (3) develop and
evaluate strategies for communicating COI risks of bias designed to safeguard against the perverse
outcomes in current disclosure practices. The results of this research will underwrite novel evidence-based
recommendations for COI policies in biomedical research as well as recommendations for more effective
disclosure practices. To achieve these aims, this project will leverage machine-learning to identify systemic
COI networks within the biomedical research enterprises for specific drug products. The research team will
then evaluate to what extent network metrics predict relative increases in adverse event rates and severity
for identified products."

Hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), is widely used in industrial processes such as stainless steel production,
electroplating, textile manufacturing, wood preservation, and leather tanning. Occupational or environmental
exposures to Cr(VI) have been associated with a variety of adverse respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal,
hematological, and hepatic effects. However, the impact of Cr(VI) exposure on musculoskeletal system is largely
unknown. The 3-month toxicity study by National Toxicology Program (NTP) reported a dose-related increase of
serum creatine kinase (CK) activities in rodents exposed to Cr(VI) via drinking water compared to the control
group, indicating muscle injury. Consistently, a significant increase of serum CK activity was reported in chrome
plating workers compared to the control subjects. Despite a clear sign of muscle injury has been reported in both
human and animal study, the impact of Cr(VI) exposure on muscle injury and regeneration is completely unknown.
Our preliminary study reveals that acute exposure of mouse C2C12 myoblast cells to Cr(VI) inhibits myogenic
differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, Cr(VI) inhibition of myogenesis is further confirmed in
freshly isolated mouse primary myoblasts ex vivo. Moreover, the expression of key myogenic regulatory factors
(MRFs) was significantly altered in Cr(VI)-treated cells. Furthermore, whole transcriptome profiling using RNA-
sequencing identified many molecules and pathways that mediate Cr(VI) inhibition of myogenic differentiation.
Taking together, our results demonstrate an inhibitory effect of Cr(VI) in myogenic differentiation in vitro and ex
vivo. Given that in vitro myogenic differentiation largely recapitulates in vivo myogenesis during early embryo
development and adult muscle regeneration, we hypothesize that Cr(VI) adversely affects skeletal muscle
development and regeneration in vivo. In this proposal, we aim to address whether Cr(VI) lead to defective
myogenesis and impaired muscle regeneration with the following specific aims. First, we will examine the effects
of acute or chronic Cr(VI) exposure on adult muscle injury and regeneration in vivo. Second, we will explore the
impact of Cr(VI) on skeletal muscle development by assessing primary and secondary myogenesis in mouse
embryos prenatally exposed to Cr(VI). Lastly, to elucidate the mechanism underlying Cr(VI) inhibition of
myogenic differentiation, we will analyze the role of MyoD and Myf5 in Cr(VI)-induced defective myogenic
differentiation, and explore whether special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (Satb2), a known Cr(VI) target
gene in lung carcinogenesis, acts as an important target or a functional mediator of Cr(VI) in myogenic
differentiation. The success of the proposed research will generate valuable evidence to support Cr(VI) exposure
as a risk factor for muscle impairment, and provide additional insights on prevention and therapeutic approaches
for muscle-related disease."

In mammals generally, including humans, the ovary ceases its functions little more than halfway through a
female's lifespan. This is strikingly different from the changes that occur in other organs, leading to a very long
post-reproductive period in humans. Female reproductive aging is characterized by a loss of follicles; follicles
are the functional units of the ovary, consisting of oocytes surrounded by companion granulosa cells. All the
oocytes/follicles that the ovary will ever have will have been generated in utero or at a very early postnatal age.
The study of ovarian reserve regulation has been very germ cell centric, relegating to a quite secondary role the
ovarian stroma and the microenvironment (including somatic cells and the extracellular matrix). In fact, the
microenvironment in which cells grow and develop informs function. Recent publications have shown that the
ovarian stroma becomes inflammatory, fibrotic, and stiff with advanced reproductive age. These phenotypes are
mechanistically linked to changes in the hyaluronan (HA) matrix, a ubiquitous and polydisperse extracellular
glycosaminoglycan that regulates tissue homeostasis. In its high-molecular-weight (HMW) form, HA binds water
and promotes hydration and has anti-inflammatory properties. In contrast, low-molecular-weight (LMW) HA tends
to have pro-inflammatory properties. High levels of HA are associated with stem cell proliferation and protection
from differentiation during early embryogenesis. The naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber, NMR) is a unique
rodent species which lives up to four decades and maintains reproductive function throughout its entire lifespan.
This extreme longevity is attributable in part to the production of large amounts of very-high-molecular-weight
hyaluronan (vHMW-HA). vHMW-HA is produced in NMRs by a uniquely modified version of the hyaluronan
synthase 2 gene (Has2). In the proposed research, we will test the overarching hypothesis that the stromal
microenvironment of the fetal ovary, including an HA-rich matrix, regulates the establishment and maintenance
of the ovarian reserve and reproductive longevity."

Sepsis is a medical emergency defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host
response to infection. Septic shock is the most severe form, involving cardiovascular failure. More than
75,000 children in the US and four million children worldwide are hospitalized with sepsis or septic shock every
year. Sepsis is currently the most expensive hospital condition in the US and, for critically ill patients—
including children—is the most common cause of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and hospital death.1,26
The World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have called for
optimizing therapies for sepsis.33 Because fluid resuscitation provides the best established benefit for septic
shock (other than antibiotics), there has been an effort to identify the most effective fluid administration
strategy. Despite progress, a remaining key gap in knowledge delineated by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign is
which crystalloid fluid is the most effective and safest to use for initial resuscitation of septic shock.
Two types of crystalloids are used for resuscitation in sepsis: 0.9% “normal” saline (NS) and balanced fluids
(BF). BF have well-established biologic and physiologic advantages over NS and two recent adult trials found
that BF reduced major adverse kidney events and mortality. However, in the absence of pediatric-specific
data, NS resuscitation remains the overwhelming preference among pediatric emergency clinicians. We
therefore propose the PRagMatic Pediatric Trial of Balanced versus NOrmaL Saline FlUid in Sepsis (PRoMPT
BOLUS) study, a randomized, open-label, pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial, to test the relative
effectiveness and safety of BF versus NS fluid resuscitation in children with suspected septic shock. Eighteen
pediatric emergency departments in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) will
collaborate with sites in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand to enroll 8,800 children with suspected septic
shock. Eligible patients will be enrolled either through prospective informed consent or, after appropriate
ethical safeguards, “Exception From Informed Consent” for emergency research. Subjects will be randomized
to fluid resuscitation and maintenance fluids with either NS or BF for 24-48 hours, with all aspects of care other
than fluid type at the discretion of the care team. Our primary outcome is major adverse kidney events within
30 days from randomization (MAKE30), a patient-centered composite endpoint that includes persistent kidney
dysfunction, initiation of dialysis, or death. This outcome addresses the biological advantages of BF to
preserve renal blood flow and function compared to NS. Secondary outcomes include the individual
components of MAKE30, hospital-free days, length of stay, 90-day mortality, and specified safety events.
This pragmatic trial will provide the definitive evidence necessary for a “paradigm shift” to move
clinical practice from 0.9% saline to balanced fluid-based resuscitation in children with septic shock."

Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) consists of a series of processes that takes place in the
inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Energy flux through OXPHOS appears to be intrinsically modulated by
the lipid composition of IMM by mechanisms that are not clearly understood. In particular, phosphatidyl-
ethanolamine (PE) is a cone-shaped non-bilayer lipid that induces membrane curvature in cristae and binds
with high affinity to mitochondrial respiratory complexes and regulate their functions. We found that
interventions that induce high OXPHOS flux are accompanied by increases in mitochondrial PE, and such
increase was sufficient to increase mitochondrial respiratory capacity. The central premise of this proposal is to
provide a comprehensive bioenergetics prognosis for altered mitochondrial PE content. Combining high-
resolution respirometry, fluorometry, electrophysiology, and microscopy, we will examine the role of PE in the
following processes: 1) Regulation of mitochondrial pyruvate entry at IMM to facilitate the Warburg effect, 2)
Origin of electron leak in the electron transport chain to induce oxidative stress, and 3) Efficiency of ATP
synthesis to alter cellular fuel economy."

Mosquitoes infect hundreds of millions of people with deadly pathogens every year. Since mosquitoes
identify humans and other important resources primarily via their sense of smell, the disruption of
mosquito olfactory systems has long been recognized as a potential strategy for controlling these
pathogens. For example, repellants that scramble or block the detection of odors may be used to push
mosquitoes away from humans and the areas where we live and work. Conversely, irresistibly attractive
blends of volatile chemicals may be deployed to pull mosquitoes into lethal traps. Despite some
advances in this area over the past decade, progress has been limited by the fact that the olfactory
systems of our most important vector mosquitoes remain largely uncharacterized. We know that
mosquitoes detect odors using hundreds of ligand-specific olfactory receptors expressed in ~60 different
types of odor-sensing neurons scattered across their antennae and maxillary palps. But we don’t yet
know exactly which of these neurons mosquitoes use to detect humans nor which receptors are
expressed in those neurons. The parent award of this administrative supplement aims to characterize the
molecular and functional properties of all major odor-sensing cell types on the antennae of biting females
of the dengue, yellow fever, and zika vector mosquito Aedes aegypti. In Aim 1, we proposed to identify
the molecular receptors expressed in each of the ~60 types of odor-sensing neurons using single-
nucleus RNA sequencing. This work has been completed successfully and is currently being prepared
for publication. In Aim 2, we proposed to generate the genetic tools necessary to manipulate each type of
odor-sensing neuron using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. This work is in progress. In Aim 3, we
proposed to use the genetic tools from Aim 2 to identify the chemical odorants detected by each odor-
sensing neuron type. This third aim represents a critical final step in our overarching goal to determine
exactly which odor-sensing neurons mosquitoes use to detect humans. However, it requires the use of a
sophisticated two-photon microscope for imaging neural responses in odor-sensing neurons, and this
microscope recently malfunctioned. In this application, we are requesting an administrative supplement
to cover the cost of the unexpected repair to this microscope. Without these funds, we will not be able to
complete the goals of the parent award. Taken together we expect to generate a receptor-neuron-ligand
map for Aedes aegypti vector mosquitoes and a library of genetic tools with which to manipulate them—
opening the door to the efficient and rational design of chemical repellants and attractants for use in
vector control."

A single gene can give rise to several alternatively spliced protein isoforms (i.e., proteoforms) that acquire
cancer-promoting functions. These cancer-associated proteoforms, compared to their normal counterparts, can
exhibit differential binding to protein partners that lead to the “rewiring” of cellular networks. To derive insight
into cancer cellular systems, network biology tools, such as Cytoscape, has been developed to visualize and
analyze cancer from a network biology framework. However, the molecular diversity of proteoforms is not
reflected in cancer interactome models. A limitation to progress in this area is conceptually simple. In nearly all
a biological network models, ‘nodes’ represent proteins and ‘edges’ connect pairs of proteins that exhibit a
functional interaction. This is a problem because a gene may have a canonical annotated function, but the
cancer-associated proteoform can exhibit entirely different functions. Rather than conflating all proteoforms into
one gene representation, in this proposal, the IMAT and ITCR team will create a formal representation of
proteoforms in a network biology framework, based on the Cytoscape eXchange (CX) schema that underlies
all NDEx network resources. At the project’s end, the IMAT and ITCR teams will release the new proteoform
data specification (PCX), proteoform networks in the public NDEx database, and an NDEx-compatible
Cytoscape web analysis module based on PCX to analyze proteoform networks. This project will catalyze new
end-user applications that the NDEx resource will serve, as well as provide for the IMAT team advanced
network analysis that can be performed on experimentally generated cancer interactomes."

Uterine leiomyomata (UL), or fibroids, are neoplasms of the myometrium that are associated with heavy
menstrual bleeding, anemia, pelvic pain, infertility, and complications of pregnancy and delivery. In the United
States (U.S.), UL are diagnosed in 25%-30% of reproductive-aged females and they are the leading indication
for hysterectomy. Black women are disproportionately affected by UL, experiencing greater incidence, earlier
age at first diagnosis and surgery, and greater disease severity on average than White women. Factors
associated with UL incidence, growth, and symptom severity are poorly understood. Not all UL patients
experience the same symptoms, and the relation of UL characteristics (e.g., size, number, location) with
symptom severity and quality of life has not been well studied. Since its inception in 2010, the NIEHS-funded
Study of Environment, Lifestyle and Fibroids (SELF) has carried out nearly 8,000 clinic visits during a 10-year
period among >1600 Black females living in the Detroit area with the goal of defining the natural history of UL
and identifying risk factors for UL incidence and growth (R01ES028235: funding completed 8/2022). This cohort
of minority participants who are underrepresented in scientific research has >85% retention during approximately
10 years of follow-up. Data from SELF participants have already produced 58 peer reviewed publications. The
present R01 renewal application will extend the follow-up of the cohort for another 5 years (incident period: 15
years) with an additional (6th) clinic visit, which will again involve performing transvaginal ultrasounds to map and
measure UL among new and existing cases, collect biospecimens, and gather detailed covariate data via
interview. These new data, combined with data from both completed and soon to be completed analyses of
biological samples from prior SELF study visits, will be used to achieve the following specific aims: 1) Describe
changes in UL incidence and characteristics (size, number, location) during a 15-year period; 2) Determine the
relationship between UL characteristics and UL symptom severity as ascertained by the UFS-QOL, a validated
UL-specific quality of life questionnaire; and 3) Build on our previous work by evaluating a broader set of
biomarkers of environmental chemicals and/or their metabolites in blood and urine from targeted panels (e.g.,
heavy metals, PCBs, PFAS, PBDEs, phthalates, phenols) and untargeted metabolomics to identify exposures
associated with UL incidence and growth during a longer incident period (up to 15 years). We will use flexible
approaches to evaluate non-linearity and assess interaction between exposures. As SELF participants were
ages 23-35 years at enrollment and are nearing peak age of UL incidence (40-45 years), the ongoing study of
cohort members is extremely valuable. With its prospective study design, serial ultrasounds, repeated collection
of data on exposures and covariates, interdisciplinary research team, and inclusion of a highly-engaged study
population, the SELF cohort is ideal for defining the natural history of UL and the environmental factors that
influence it in a population disproportionately affected by the condition."

Genomic research presents a unique opportunity for molecular diagnosis of individuals with rare disease, which
may empower precision therapies to alleviate the individual and public health burden of these conditions.
However, minoritized populations remain underrepresented in rare disease genomic research, and optimal
strategies to address this lack of representation remain poorly understood. The consequences of these
knowledge gaps extend beyond the research realm and threaten the equitable provision of genomic medicine
services in clinical practice. This project takes the critical next step towards further understanding, and ultimately
breaking down, barriers to rare disease genomic research participation for historically underrepresented
populations, in a hybrid type 3 effectiveness-implementation study design informed by the RE-AIM (Reach,
Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework. A diversity, equity, and inclusion toolkit for
genomic researchers will be developed and implemented within the Broad Institute’s Rare Genomes Project
(Aim 1), with concurrent evaluation of multiple dimensions of effectiveness employing a mixed-methods
approach (Aims 2 and 3). In Aim 1, stakeholder interviews will be conducted with both rare disease genomic
research participants as well as providers who refer these participants to further explore barriers and facilitators
of research engagement, with specific attention to study logistics and inclusive practices. This qualitative analysis
will inform development and refinement of a toolkit comprising specific strategies portable to other environments
to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion. This toolkit will then be implemented within the Rare Genomes Project
in order to enroll a cohort of 200 participants who are historically underrepresented in rare disease genomic
research, with concurrent evaluation of the following implementation outcomes: Reach, as reflected in the
demographics of study participants; Adoption, as reflected in the characteristics of referring providers; and
Implementation fidelity, as reflected in the proportion of participants who complete the study process from
enrollment to sequencing. In Aim 2, Effectiveness of genome sequencing (GS) for this cohort of 200 participants
will be evaluated, reflected in diagnostic and clinical utility, with analysis taking into account the impact of social
and structural informants of health on these outcomes. In Aim 3, patient-centered utility of GS will be assessed
both in this cohort as well as a larger, diverse cohort of rare disease genomic research participants to better
assess longitudinal, multidimensional impact (Maintenance). This study will therefore generate utility data from
a diverse population that provides real-world guidance regarding equitable applications of GS for rare disease
diagnosis. Study results will inform strategies to improve access to GS and will identify key areas of clinical
impact in order to direct policies related its clinical adoption. Successful completion of the proposed study will
thus directly inform equitable clinical implementation of genomic medicine."

The goal of Dr. Shannon Yan's career development application is to understand the energetic and mechanistic principles
that govern structural and functional switching by proteins critical for cellular regulation. Dr. Yan will begin with
studying transitions of human mitotic-arrest deficient 2 protein MAD2 in the context of co-translational protein folding,
and ultimately focus on its dynamic fold-switching flux established in vivo by folding effectors and chaperones. As
structure dictates the function of a biomolecule, MAD2 is capable of switching folds between an inactive open state and
mitotic-arrest closed state to modulate the formation of spindle assembly during mitosis—otherwise leading to detrimental
chromosome instability or cancerous development. This proposal will explore the molecular details regarding MAD2
structure-function transitions, aiming to elucidate the underlying principles for the operation of protein switches: 1) Is
there a default native fold, or an initial equilibrium condition, when MAD2 is first synthesized? Dr. Yan's invention of the
first single-human-ribosome translation assay on optical tweezers will directly resolve in real-time the co-translational
folding trajectory for a single MAD2 protein as its nascent polypeptide gradually emerges on the human ribosome surface.
2) Is the co-translational folding pathway, and thus the prevalence of one conformer over the other, influenced by folding
effectors dependent on the physiological state of cells? Dr. Yan will examine how translation rates, the presence of
folding effectors/chaperons, and other cellular factors that may reshape the folding energy landscape for MAD2 protein
switch. Knowledge gained from her single-molecule work in the K99 phase will fuel the subsequent cell imaging studies
proposed for the R00 phase: 3) How does MAD2 oscillate between different conformer distributions—both spatially and
temporally—in accordance with phases of the cell cycle? The flux of open and closed MAD2 protein switches at various
stages during mitosis will be characterized and correlated to other concurrent cellular events. Results obtained during this
period will enable Dr. Yan to establish herself in the field of cellular biology and cellular mechanics, in which she aims to
lead a research group as a tenure-track principal investigator at an academic research institute. Dr. Yan will apply a
multidisciplinary approach combining biophysics, molecular and cellular biology, and single-molecule methods, together
with genetic manipulations to formulate a unique research line aimed at resolving cellular dynamics and probing the
associated cellular mechanics during cell division. This five-year career development program is tailored to prepare Dr.
Yan for an independent scientific career. It will build on Dr. Yan's extensive background in ribosome translation and
single-molecule techniques, while expanding her skill sets in molecular biology and biochemistry to investigate folding of
metamorphic protein switches. Her training program will be directed by Dr. Carlos Bustamante at UC Berkeley—an
internationally recognized leader in protein folding and with extensive records of mentorship. Dr. Tanaka and Dr.
Legname will also join in to support Dr. Yan's research, professional growth, and her transition into independence. The
long-term objective of Dr. Yan's independent research is to expand our understanding on how cells modulate biological
signals to grow and multiply, and to identify the origins of regulatory deviations that lead to diseases in humans."

The NIH Implementing a Maternal Health and PRegnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone (IMPROVE) initiative
aims to reduce maternal mortality, improve pregnancy, perinatal and postpartum care, and to address the factors
that have led to severe disparities in outcomes for marginalized groups. The University of Pennsylvania (Penn)
proposes creating the Achieving Maternal Equity and Transforming Health through Implementation Science and
Training (AMETHIST@Penn) Implementation Science Hub to support IMPROVE Maternal Health Research
Centers of Excellence (CoEs) and other IMPROVE investigators, and to coordinate with NIH Staff Scientists,
Project Staff, and the Data Innovation and Coordinating Hub. AMETHIST@Penn will be led by MPIs Meghan
Lane Fall, MD, MSHP, and Rebecca Hamm, MD, MSCE, who bring complementary and necessary strengths in
implementation science (IS) and maternal health. Dr. Lane-Fall is Executive Director of the Penn Implementation
Science Center at the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics (PISCE@LDI). She is an internationally
recognized acute care IS expert with an independent IS research program. She has 8 years of experience as a
collaborator and consultant advising investigators on: selection of IS theories, models, and frameworks, including
those focused on equity; implementation mapping and strategy selection; implementation outcome selection;
data integration across multiple types and sources; and advanced analytic procedures to elucidate change
mechanisms. Dr. Hamm is a maternal fetal medicine specialist who has established herself nationally as a

leading an interdisciplinary, interprofessional group of more than 45 scientists and community partners. The
AMETHIST@Penn Hub will comprise five Cores, each with two Co-Leads and 2-4 Core Investigators:
1) Administration, Leadership, and Evaluation; 2) Equity, Community and Stakeholder Engagement (with an
Equity Advisory and Oversight Board to advise and hold investigators accountable for incorporating equity into
their research); 3) Design, Methods, and Analysis (including a Consultant Panel with Methods, Equity, and
Clinical subpanels to meet the anticipated consultation and technical assistance needs of the CoEs); 4) Policy,
Dissemination, and Communication (with skills building in messaging and media training); and 5) Training and
Capacity Building (featuring an innovative academic-community partner training program and a comprehensive
mentored research experience for both new and established investigators). In addition to establishing and
administering the Hub, a research aim includes prospective mixed methods research on IS investigators,
community partners, and institutions to characterize predictors of project-based implementation success and
multilevel barriers to and facilitators of the conduct of maternal health IS research. The AMETHIST@Penn hub
will advance public health and maternal health equity by facilitating rigorous implementation research that
centers the needs and perspectives of patients, communities, and health disparity populations."
11133377,"ABSTRACT: Pre-existing T cell responses have been correlated with decreased disease severity and positive
clinical outcomes during the influenza pandemic of 2009 and the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore,
diversifying T cell responses, particularly targeting conserved internal viral proteins such as the influenza virus
nucleoprotein (NP), could confer protection against both epidemic and pandemic strains of influenza A virus
(IAV). We have designed a mosaic nucleoprotein (MNP) composed of 9-mer epitopes derived from the complete
set of 7,422 NP sequences from human, swine, and avian IAVs. We have strong evidence that a vaccine
formulation consisting of MNP and a combination adjuvant (Adjuplex + TLR-4 agonist glucopyranosyl lipid A
[GLA]) elicits T cell responses that protect against epidemic and pandemic strains of influenza A virus in mice.
Avian influenza viruses have decimated poultry in the US and many parts of the world, and most concerningly,
these viruses have spilled over to infect multiple mammalian species, including cats and cows. Most notably, the
H5N1 avian influenza virus in cows is rapidly spreading to multiple states in the US. Currently, there is serious
concern about the possibility of the rapidly spreading avian influenza virus in cows mutating to gain the potential
to infect humans, cause severe disease, and efficiently spread by airborne transmission. Therefore, it is critical
to develop vaccine strategies to protect humans, and contain avian influenza virus infection and transmission in
cows. Significantly, the MNP we generated exhibits close homology to the NP of the H5N1 virus affecting dairy
cows in the ongoing outbreak. We hypothesize that the MNP will be immunogenic and that T cell responses
elicited by the MNP-based vaccine will provide effective protection against the currently circulating strains of
avian influenza virus isolated from cows.
The aims of this administrative supplement are: (1) Test the hypothesis that mosaic nucleoprotein (MNP)
formulated in the combination adjuvants (Adjuplex+GLA or Adjuplex+CdN) will elicit diverse antibody and T cell
responses in circulation and mammary gland of ferrets and cows; (2) Test the hypothesis that mosaic
nucleoprotein (MNP) formulated in the combination adjuvants (Adjuplex+GLA or Adjuplex+CdN) will protect
ferrets against H5N1 in lungs, upper respiratory tract, and the mammary gland. The proposed studies will have
implications in the development of effective vaccines to protect humans against avian influenza, break the

10% to 20% of all cardiac surgical procedures in the United States. A better understanding of the heart valvular
disorders and underlying molecular mechanisms is important to aid in the management and treatment of
patients with VHD. Endothelial mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is a complex biological process in which
endothelial cells progressively evolve into cells with a mesenchymal phenotype. EndMT plays an essential role
in cardiac valve formation and function, and EndMT is temporally and spatially regulated during organ
development and maintenance. Abnormal EndMT is critically implicated in the pathogenesis of both congenital
cardiac valve disease and late-onset cardiac valve dysfunction. Thus, further understanding exact molecular
pathways that control EndMT during cardiac valve development and maintenance is likely to be significant in
order to develop therapeutic strategies to ameliorate heart valve disease. It has been well-established that
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), one of the most potent regulators of angiogenesis, also plays a key
role in control of EndMT during cardiac valve development. A series of our previous studies have demonstrated
that a newly discovered serine/threonine protein kinas family members of protein kinase D (PKD), are key
signal molecules in mediating VEGF signaling and function. The nascent data from our recent preliminary
studies suggested a key role of protein kinase D3 (PKD3, gene name Prkd3) in regulation of EndMT and VHD.
In current application, we will determine how PKD3 regulates EndMT and heart valve development,
physiological function and pathological changes, and how to manipulate the PKD3-dependent signaling
pathways to prevent excessive EndMT and cardiac valve enlargement, ultimately, leading to new approaches
to treat VHD. Upon completion of the proposed studies, it will have significant impact on our understanding of
EndMT and cardiac valve development and function, and provide valuable information on the underlying
molecular mechanisms of cardiac valve development and abnormal factors for VHD, which will help to design
new therapeutic strategies for combating VHD. Recently, as part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute (NHLBI)’s implementation of the Cardiovascular Advances in Research and Opportunities Legacy
(CAROL) Act, NHLBI issued a Notice of Special Interest to seek R01 applications that propose research in
valvular heart disease (NOT-HL-23-079). Thus, our work is extremely important and highly relevant to NHLBI’s
mission to elucidate the pathophysiology of VHD and to reduce the burdens of human heart disease."
11135717,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Calcific aortic valve disease is a common disorder that causes substantial medical care costs and health burden.
The only current therapy is aortic valve replacement. Without replacement, mortality rates approach 50% within
2-3 years of diagnosis. Aortic valve replacement does not come without risks, as mechanical valves, while stable,
require life-long anticoagulation therapy, and bioprosthetic valves last only a decade. Thus, there is a great need
for early non-surgical therapeutic interventions. Our long-term goal is to dissect the mechanisms that transform
a healthy valve into a calcifying valve, to identify potential targets for the development of non-surgical therapies.
For calcification to occur, the aortic valve interstitial cell must undergo extensive changes to alter its chromatin
structure and transcriptome. We recently made the discovery that telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is
required for the osteogenic reprogramming of valve interstitial cells. TERT is well known for its critical role in
elongating telomeres, however we and others have identified non-canonical transcriptional regulatory and chro-
matin remodeling functions of TERT, yet the understanding of these non-canonical roles is in its nascency. We
have found TERT transcript and protein levels are elevated in human calcified aortic valves. Our in vitro studies
show that genetic deletion/reduction of TERT reduces calcification in valve interstitial cells from human and
mouse. We have demonstrated that TERT initiates osteogenic transcriptional programs by coupling with tran-
scription factor STAT5 to bind and activate the promoter of the osteogenic master regulator RUNX2. Osteogenic
treatment or inflammatory stimuli elevated transcription and protein levels of TERT and STAT5 in valve interstitial
cells. We also identified that TERT co-localized with the chromatin remodeling protein BRG1 in these calcifying
cells. From these data we hypothesize that inflammatory stress initiates TERT-mediated osteogenic reprogram-
ming of valve interstitial cells by scaffolding the STAT5 transcription factor with proteins required for chromatin
remodeling and histone modification. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will investigate the epigenetic and transcrip-
tional changes directed by TERT during osteogenic reprogramming of aortic valve interstitial cells, Aim 2 will
visualize the dynamics of TERT/STAT5 interaction and identify epigenome-modifying binding partners of TERT,
and Aim3 will utilize 3D in vitro cell co-cultures of valve interstitial cells and inflammatory cells and spatial RNA
sequencing on a spectrum of diseased human aortic valves to define the contribution of specific inflammatory
cell types in valve calcification. With these integrated multi-omics and disease modeling approaches we will be
able to identify the key drivers of the initial switch that triggers osteogenic cellular reprogramming of valve cells.
Understanding these mechanisms may enable us to develop noninvasive therapies to halt, prevent, or even
reverse aortic valve calcification."
11135718,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR) impacts approximately 3% of the general population and 10% of adults
older than 75 years. Its treatment has significantly evolved with commercial availability of transcatheter edge-to-
edge repair (TEER) in 2013, a percutaneous alternative to surgical repair. More than a decade later, differences
in clinical effectiveness and patient-centered outcomes between transcatheter and surgical treatment of severe
DMR are unclear, and critical, as TEER technology is increasingly applied broadly in younger patients. There
are several gaps in knowledge in this regard that our study proposes to address. First, given that this field is in
its relative infancy, and there are no head-to-head randomized clinical trials of TEER vs surgery in DMR, long-
term comparative clinical outcomes between available treatment strategies are unknown. Our study will leverage
the existing institutional infrastructure of our high-volume mitral valve disease referral center for longitudinal
follow up of approximately 1800 patients (900 TEER and 900 surgical repair) with multimodality imaging to
compare long-term clinical effectiveness, safety and durability outcomes upto 10 years. Second, postoperative
left ventricular dysfunction occurs in 10-20% of patient who receive surgical repair, and is associated with worse
outcomes, but its incidence after TEER is not known, and mechanistic insights are sparse. We hypothesize that
left ventricular dysfunction occurs less frequently after TEER as it is performed without circulatory arrest, and
that presence, severity and distribution of myocardial fibrosis may predict its occurrence after TEER or surgery.
We will utilize advanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging techniques in a prospectively enrolled
cohort of 300 patients (150 TEER and 150 surgical repair) to examine this relationship that will facilitate
identification of targets of pharmacotherapy and timing of mitral valve intervention in DMR. Third, comparison of
patient-reported outcome measures that characterize their postoperative recovery after TEER versus surgical
treatment of DMR are imperative for guiding informed consent and shared decision-making in this aging
population for whom quality of life may be as important as risk of complications or mortality. Our proposed study
will have broad impact as we will provide timely long-term clinical effectiveness, safety and patient-reported
outcomes data comparing TEER with surgery for DMR that will inform better patient selection, procedural
techniques, and intensity of follow-up. We will also elucidate potential pathobiological impact of left ventricular
fibrosis and other imaging biomarkers on postoperative left ventricular dysfunction, a marker of worse clinical
prognosis, that will identify potential treatment targets against fibrosis to reduce rates of LV dysfunction and
improve outcomes."
11135001,"This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) deﬁned as “NOT-CA-24-058”.
Landmark studies such as the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated that low-dose computed
tomography (LDCT) screening reduces lung cancer mortality, but the growing use of LDCT has also led to the annual
discovery of over a million indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs), which in the context of this project are solid
noncalciﬁed nodules between 6-30 mm in diameter. While IPNs are largely benign, their discovery induces anxiety
among patients, creates a burden on the healthcare system, and, for some patients, represents early-stage cancer.
Newer imaging-based biomarkers and the use of the patient’s evolving medical history can improve prediction and
support earlier diagnosis in the setting of the IPNs. Key challenges to overcome include handling variations in how
CT studies are acquired, characterizing and modeling changes in nodular and perinodular features observed over
longitudinal imaging scans, and predicting whether an IPN is malignant. This supplement utilizes longitudinal
clinical and imaging data collected as part of the NLST but addresses several critical limitations: (1) nodules were
not uniquely identiﬁed, (2) nodules were not tracked over multiple scans, (3) the precise location of nodules and
their boundaries were not delineated, and (4) lung cancer diagnoses were not linked to individual nodules. This
project complements the parent U01 (EFIRM Liquid Biopsy Research Laboratory: Early Lung Cancer Assessment,
U01 CA233370, Contact PI: Wong), which seeks to develop and validate a blood-based technology to distinguish
benign and malignant IPNs. Our overarching hypothesis is that the combination of longitudinal semantic
(radiologist-interpreted), radiomic (e.g., handcrafted shape, intensity, and texture), and deep (e.g., neural-network
learned) features can predict nodule malignancy among IPNs with higher positive predictive value than nodule
volume alone. We will investigate whether the change in these features (delta image features) captures the natural
history of tumor and peritumoral appearance, hypothesizing that these subtle changes reﬂect shifts in the tissue
microenvironment and can be used to di]erentiate between benign and malignant nodules. We accomplish this
with two aims: (1) characterize longitudinal changes in nodules using semantic, radiomic, and deep features and (2)
assess the predictive value of longitudinal features in classifying IPNs. We have established a team of investigators
with expertise in liquid biopsy, machine learning/informatics, and thoracic radiology. Our e]orts will collectively
result in a comprehensive annotated dataset of NLST IPN cases as they evolve and the identiﬁcation of delta image
features that can be surrogate endpoints for clinical trials and physician support services."

11135020,"PROJECT SUMMARY
In nature and human microbiomes, microbes regularly face challenges due to fluctuations in the availability of
resources and nutrients - a lifestyle termed feast/famine. Previous studies investigating microbial adaptation to
feast/famine have focused on the specific adaptations that allow microbes to survive extreme starvation, often
overlooking how the eventual replenishment of resources affects evolution. However, due to evolutionary
tradeoffs between growth and survival, the molecular, cellular, and behavioral phenotypes that evolve in
response to feast/famine may vary based on the duration and severity of starvation. Common adaptations to
resource limitation include expanding metabolic capability through nutritional competence and increasing
efficiency by diversification into cross-feeding ecotypes. As microbial metabolism can be constrained by many
biologically relevant factors, including the presence of oxygen, this can complicate evolution and limit potential
adaptive trajectories. Research in my lab focuses on how microbes adapt and diversify in novel complex
environments by applying multi-omic, systems microbiology approaches to experimental evolution. We plan to
investigate how oxygen availability shapes microbial evolution to feast/famine by conducting an adaptive
laboratory evolution experiment with two bacterial species, the facultative anaerobe Escherichia coli, and the
fastidious aerotolerant anaerobe Lactobacillus crispatus. We will characterize populations for fitness outcomes,
common adaptive mutations, and patterns of diversification to determine how oxygen influences adaptation to
feast/famine conditions. We will follow up by characterizing the effects of common adaptive mutations on
microbial physiology using transcriptomics and high-throughput phenotyping. Further, as oxygen can shift the
topography of the adaptive landscape by affecting the rate and spectra of mutations, we will also perform
mutation accumulation experiments on facultatively anaerobic, aerotolerant anaerobic, and obligately
anaerobic bacterial species in the presence and absence of oxygen. Studies of microbial evolution have
historically neglected fastidious microorganisms and anaerobic environments due to the challenges associated
with their culture. Our research will provide fundamental knowledge about evolutionary processes in a
neglected fraction of the microbial tree of life that accounts for a significant proportion of the human
microbiome."
11033040,"More than 30% of children diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse after initial treatment, creating an urgent need for new treatment options. T-cell receptor (TCR) based therapies are a promising way to combat these cases due to their ability to target intracellular antigens that other therapies can’t reach. This proposal describes an approach to discover a set of known and novel AML-specific targets and new TCR drug candidates. A novel library-vs-library screening method will be used to screen repertoires of donor T-cells against 30 AML targets simultaneously for functional activation, with resolution of TCR-target interaction at the single-cell level. Beyond previously validated targets, novel AML targets will be selected across common MHC alleles for expression and presentation. Potential relationships between TCRs and AML targets can be identified through the analysis of single-cell sequencing data, and the most promising TCR candidates from the screen can be validated using gold-standard T cell assays. If successful, the TCRs identified by this proposal can be further developed into therapies for AML. Given the flexibility of TCRs, the method described in this proposal can also be applied to other cancers that lack treatment options for patients who fail frontline therapies."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and ranks third in cancer mortality.
HCC has limited treatment options and carries a poor prognosis (17% 5-year survival rate), highlighting the
importance of disease prevention. Known HCC risk factors include hepatitis B or C infection, alcohol abuse, or
environmental contaminants like aflatoxin B1. These risk factors are most common in East Asia, South America,
and Africa, which have proportionally higher HCC rates. However, HCC incidence and mortality in Western
countries are increasing; liver cancer is poised to become the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the
U.S. by 2030. New risk factors, including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, account for less than a fifth of U.S. cases,
suggesting the existence of unidentified environmental risk factors. We have found that developmental exposure
to environmentally relevant doses of the chemical pollutant bisphenol A (BPA) is associated with HCC in both
male and female C57BL/6J mice. Exposed mice show dose-responsive rates of HCC in response to BPA alone,
with no known co-exposures. This finding implicates BPA as a complete carcinogen in the liver, responsible for
both stages of carcinogenesis: initiation and promotion. In addition, the dose-responsive increase in HCC with
increasing BPA dose is characteristic of genotoxic cancer initiation. Prior data show that BPA increases cellular
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that BPA induces a mutation spectrum consistent with ROS-induced
oxidative DNA damage. BPA also disrupts endocrine signaling through estrogen receptor α (ERα). ERα signaling
protects females against HCC, which is why males are more prone to this form of cancer. However, we found
that this sex difference in HCC incidence was lost in BPA-exposed mice, suggesting that the endocrine disruptive
effects of BPA eliminated the protection normally afforded females by intact ERα function. In this proposal, we
will test the central hypothesis that BPA acts as a complete carcinogen in the liver. Specifically, we hypothesize
that developmental BPA initiates HCC via oxidatively induced DNA damage and promotes HCC via endocrine
disruption. In Aim 1, we will test the causal role of oxidative mutagenesis in HCC initiation by experimentally
increasing the rate of mutation accumulation (in DNA repair-deficient mice exposed to BPA) and rescuing
damage (by co-exposing mice to an antioxidant). In Aim 2, we will test the causal role of ERα signaling in HCC
promotion by experimentally increasing signaling (by co-exposing mice to BPA and an ERα agonist) and
decreasing signaling (by co-exposing mice to BPA and an ERα antagonist). The results of these studies will
settle a long-standing debate about the carcinogenic potential of BPA, as well delineate the role of this ubiquitous
environmental pollutant as a potential new environmental risk factor for HCC."
10885205,"ABSTRACT
Radiation therapy (RT) modulates immunological properties of tumor microenvironment (TME) to stimulate
antitumor immune response. However, RT initiates immunosuppressive mechanisms as well and therefore
diminishing the effects of RT immuno-stimulation. One of the main RT immunosuppressive modes is exerted by
an increase in TGFβ production that in breast cancers (BC) has an additive effect on already high TGFβ levels
produced by cancer cells themselves. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) in particular, was demonstrated to
have higher TGFβ levels compared to other BCs, and this finding correlated with increased tumor grade and
invasiveness, and a diminished patient survival. Consequently, RT induced increase in TGFβ within the TME
may further potentiate invasiveness and metastatic potential of TNBC. Due to stimulatory aspects of RT
immunomodulation, RT has gained interest as a prospective therapeutic enhancer in cancer immunotherapy,
such as immune checkpoint blockers, that has shown great potential in improving local control and overall
survival in select cancers. Unfortunately, in most forms of BC, including TNBC, response to immunotherapy
remains modest. Our long-term goal is to use RT to enhance TNBC response to immunotherapy by taking
advantage of RT immunomodulatory potential. Antitumor RT effects, including TME immunomodulation can be
improved by using radiosensitizers, such as gold nanoparticles (AuNP). Furthermore, AuNPs can also serve as
a drug delivery system by conjugation of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). In this project we propose to use
AuNPs functionally modified by TGFβ siRNA to simultaneously enhance RT immunomodulation and counteract
the immunosuppressive effects related to the increased TGFβ production. This approach will enhance RT
antitumor effects and create a favorable TME environment for better response to future immunotherapies. This
will be tested by the following specific aims: Aim 1: To synthesize and characterize AuNP-siRNATGF?1; Aim
2: To investigate the therapeutic effect of combination of RT and AuNP-siRNATGFβ1 in in vitro and in vivo
mouse TNBC model. The proposed studies in determining the potential of AuNPs simultaneously target
antitumor and immunomodulatory RT effects will provide critical information for improving TNBC response to
immune checkpoint blockers and for designing future RT/ immune checkpoint blockers multimodal TNBC
therapies."
11135657,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Hospital-Acquired Infections (HAI) have become a health care crisis and are a leading cause of death.
Further the hospital setting harbors a reservoir of lethal multidrug resistant (MDR) organisms, two million
patients suffer from HAI annually, resulting in 100,000 deaths and up to $4.5 billion in additional health care
expense. Thus, there is a global health emergency due to the growing prevalence of infections caused by MDR
HAI pathogens.
 To combat these pathogens, we introduce GmPcides, a novel family of ring-fused 2-pyridone compounds
that are bactericidal against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive species, including all seven Gram-positive
species identified by the CDC as among the most significant antibiotic-resistant threats. These bacteria include
Clostridioides difficile, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
(MRSA), drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), erythromycin-resistant Group A
Streptococcus (S. pyogenes) and clindamycin-resistant Group B Streptococcus (S. agalactiae). Significantly,
GmPcides are active against non-dividing bacteria and at sub-lethal doses, can disarm resistance, to re-
sensitize MDR microbes to antibiotic treatment, both in vitro and in vivo in a murine model of HAI infection to
standard-of-care antibiotics targeting multiple orthogonal processes. GmPcides have no effect on Gram-
negative viability or significant toxicity to host tissues. Our group developed GmPcides by combining the
talents of synthetic chemist Dr. Fredrik Almqvist with microbiologists Drs. Michael Caparon and Scott Hultgren
who propose to take advantage of their understanding of HAI pathogenesis and their unprecedented ability to
manipulate the substituent diversity of the 2-pyridone scaffold to address issues essential for the translation of
GmPcides, including: i) optimization of activity, stability and solubility through structure-activity relationship
(SAR) and structure-property relationship (SPR) studies; ii) Identification of the GmPcide target(s) using a
systems-level chemical-genetic approach and the comprehensive genetic resources available for the model
Gram-positive organism Bacillus subtilis; iii) optimization of activity against HAI bacteria growing in biofilm
communities; and iv) assessment of the in vivo efficacy of improved GmPcides in murine models of HAI
urinary tract and soft tissue infection. These experiments described here will lead to the identification of critical
druggable target(s) highly conserved among Gram-positive HAI pathogens and will lead to the development of
new antibiotic-sparing and antibiotic-disarming therapies to combat the challenge of MDR HAI Gram-positive
pathogens.

11128849,"Project Summary
An effective and efficient response to climate change and other major public health threats in Africa requires
the optimal use of existing and routinely collected data, in accordance with the WHO FAIR principles. The DS-I
Africa initiative, and other projects and programs, have made significant progress in addressing barriers to data
sharing. Progress in upscaling data harmonization has, however, lagged considerably. The HarmonAIze
project addresses this key obstacle to realizing the potential of data science and Artificial Intelligence to
advance climate change and health research, and public health more broadly, in Africa and, indeed, globally.
The overall objective is to render data harmonization and climate integration more feasible, while optimizing
the inputs of health, data science and climate science experts.
Firstly, we aim to develop an open-source toolkit that leverages Artificial Intelligence to facilitate semi-
automated harmonization of health data, using large-language models to perform repetitive tasks that currently
require significant time and specialist expertise. Advances in the underlying methods will be supported by a
human-in-the-loop, judiciously utilizing domain-specific experts, while reducing common barriers to their
involvement in data science approaches. Achieving this will accelerate progress in the HE 2AT Center, but
importantly will also contribute to similar global projects, and, in fact to research on any health data reanalysis.
Secondly, the toolkit will perform spatiotemporal integration of climate and health data, leveraging advances in
African-optimized, semi-automated, geocoding pipelines and curated, downscaled, remote sensing climate
data. This approach allows for a federated approach to preserve data privacy. Additionally, this harnesses the
experience and expertise developed within the HE2AT Center to catalyze climate and health research on the
continent and beyond. We aim to pilot the approach through the DS-I Africa Research Hubs, initially UZIMA-
DS and MADIVA, contributing to a critical mass of climate-health researchers in Africa.
Thirdly, to achieve these ambitious goals, we will place an emphasis on capacity building within the HE2AT
Center and partners, focusing on early-career investigators and transdisciplinary collaboration across the
continent within the supportive scaffold of the Research Hubs, and Training Programs.
Lastly, we will collaborate with the eLwazi Open Data Science Platform, in the pursuit of establishing a Center
of Excellence for data harmonization on the continent. This platform will foster sustainability beyond the
lifespan of the HarmonAIze project and facilitate ongoing improvements and implementation in future projects.
The HarmonAize project has the potential to present a step-change in climate and health research within the
HE2AT Center, across the DS-I Africa initiative, and other projects, through developing and sharing innovative
data science tools to facilitate climate-health analyses. The project has the potential to accelerate the broad
transformation of research into public health policy and interventions, on the African continent and beyond."

Over the past four decades, UCSF and its affiliates have worked persistently on the domestic and global
HIV/AIDS crisis, including in treatment, prevention, cure efforts, advocacy, co-infections and comorbidities. The
now renamed UCSF-Bay Area Center for AIDS Research (CFAR), embedded at UCSF but with affiliate
partners, has served as a cornerstone organization to coordinate these efforts and advance HIV research
across our campus, city and beyond. Through its scientific leadership, multiple Mentoring programs, pilot
grants in the Developmental Core, Scientific Cores, community engagement, efforts towards diversity, support
of early-stage investigators (ESIs), support of underrepresented minority (URM) investigators, and global
programs, the UCSF CFAR has sought to create a vibrant, nimble, and responsive HIV research enterprise.
 The newly restructured UCSF Bay Area CFAR, under new leadership since July 2019, will continue its
oversight by the 1) Administrative Core (including coordinating communications, monitoring and evaluation,
events and community engagement) and its foundation of the 2) Developmental Core (including our acclaimed
Mentoring programs and a new mentoring program designated for URM researchers). The UCSF-Bay Area
CFAR will then reconfigure our expertise into three other Scientific Cores centered on 3) Basic and
Translational Science (Immunology, Pharmacology, a new focus of Bioinformatics); 4) Clinical Research
(including continued support of our dynamic SCOPE HIV cohort – a cohort that has been highly productive in
fostering pathogenesis and translational research; a new Participant Referral Service from the diverse publicly-
insured Ward 86 HIV Clinic to enhance diversity in SCOPE, other clinical cohorts and CFAR investigator-led
studies; and continued support of Specimen Processing and Banking); and a new focus on 5) Bio-Behavioral
Research (with a new Prevention cohort; a Substance Use Research Program; and a Biomarkers of Behavior
Program featuring a laboratory which will provide objective metrics of adherence and substance use). The five
Cores will be supplemented by two Scientific Working Groups (in Housing and Intersectionality) focused on
efforts to address structural determinants of health and grow expertise in methods to fundamentally advance
goals to End the HIV Epidemic. Finally, cross-cutting areas across the entire CFAR include health equity and
community engagement, training and career development, and international work. Each Core and Scientific
Working Group will be expected to address each of these three cross-cutting areas in their work.
 In this renewal of the UCSF CFAR, we will continue to advance multidisciplinary, cutting-edge research
in treatment, prevention, pathogenesis, cure and persistence, HIV pharmacology, clinical care paradigms,
comorbidities and coinfections, adherence, structural determinants, and other relevant research on HIV/AIDS
as we exit the first four decades of the HIV epidemic and work towards bringing it to an end."

BioSpyder proposes to develop and validate a classifier test for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) that may also
classify other dementias. Biospyder will market this as an RUO, then pursue development as a definitive in
vitro diagnostic (IVD) test, addressing a major unmet need. The program is based on a very successful Phase
I. It was found that a classifier using whole blood from a finger-stick spotted on filter paper and assayed using
the whole transcriptome TempO-Seq® gene expression assay (the WBFP TempO-Seq assay) produced
signatures for both AD and Parkinsons’s Disease that permitted a classifier to be built that identified each
initially with 87% accuracy. After retraining with additional AD samples, the WBFP TempO-Seq AD classifier
identified 100% of an independent testing cohort of AD samples correctly, and identified immune cell functional
pathways underlying the signature. AD is the most common form of dementia, with the risk of developing AD 1
in 5 for women, 1 in 10 for men. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be noticed years before those patients
can be diagnosed with AD or another dementia, years of uncertainty, no treatment, lost time to prepare for a
future with AD. That diagnosis requires cognitive testing administered by a neurologist, with in some cases
confirmation by a -amyloid PET scan. Biomarker immunoassays recently cleared under the Breakthrough
Device designation are not definitive and require cognitive testing or a -amyloid PET scan for diagnosis, and
require drawing blood or collecting cerebral spinal fluid. Thus, the still unmet need for a definitive IVD. In this
Phase II we will validate the performance of the WBFP TempO-Seq assay to classify AD patients, ability to
classify patients with other dementias, establish how early after presenting with MCI patients can be identified
with AD, correlate the WBFP TempO-Seq assay classification to -amyloid PET scans and immunoassay,
implement/validate performance of a focused WBFP TempO-Seq AD or pan-dementia test, and prepare the
materials for, and meet with, the FDA in a pre-IDE meeting to discuss the studies required for an application for
clearance as an IVD. The WBFP TempO-Seq whole transcriptome, focused, AD and focused pan-dementia
tests will be marketed for RUO use to identify novel therapeutic targets, characterize the progression from MCI
to AD, facilitate drug discovery efforts and selection/classification of patients, and potentially for development
as companion diagnostic tests. If the WBFP TempO-Seq AD or pan-dementia tests are FDA cleared, they will
be transformative, not just by providing a definitive diagnosis of AD or other dementias, but potentially by
providing that diagnosis before a diagnosis by cognitive testing can be made, and as importantly, by enabling
self-collection of samples to address health disparities in families and populations that do not have affordable
or easy access to a neurologist. If providing early, definitive diagnosis, any clinic or physician (or family
members) can evaluate persons for AD and potentially other dementias, broadening the network able to
provide diagnosis and focusing the role of the neurologist onto therapy and care."

 Extremity trauma involving large tissue loss presents a significant clinical challenge for both general and military
populations. When these injuries involve Volumetric Muscle Loss (VML), the current gold standard surgery is treatment
with muscle flap autografts or free tissue transfer. However, these result in significant fibrosis and fatty infiltration, impaired
regeneration, chronic pain, and significant long-term functional disabilities. There is currently a fundamental lack of
understanding of the molecular and cellular processes in the hostile environment of a full thickness, critically sized VML
defect which leads to the fibrotic and poor healing outcomes regardless of the treatment approach. In a series of recent
publications in pre-clinical VML models, our group has defined the critical size threshold above which the characteristic
VML hallmarks are observed: fibrosis and fatty infiltration, chronic inflammation, and lack of myofiber bridging across the
defect. We now present preliminary evidence that there is a distinct and dysregulated cellular response in the critically sized
defect with rapid proliferation of fibro-adipogenic progenitor cells (FAPs). FAPs are a dynamic mesenchymal stromal cells
that play a critical support and coordination role for muscle stem cells, also known as satellite cells (MuSCs), during
regeneration; however, in chronic muscle pathologies, like muscular dystrophies, FAPs can differentiate into fibrotic and
adipogenic lineages in a process that is thought to be directed by macrophages and specific subsets of M2 macrophages.
The overall objective of this proposal is to regenerate functional muscle after VML by engineering an immunomodulatory
biomaterial system to direct the FAPs towards a pro-regenerative state, thus creating an environmental niche conducive to
MuSCs transplantation and muscle regeneration. Our central hypothesis posits that following VML injury, local FAPs
undergo a transition to an aberrant phenotype that directly differentiates into fibrotic and fatty tissue and that controlled
delivery of pro-resolving lipid mediators will resolve these FAPs and restore the regenerative potential of MuSCs. We
propose the following aims: Aim 1: To determine the role of aberrant FAPs in fatty infiltration and fibrosis associated with
VML injuries. Aim 2: To assess the contribution of increased pro-fibrotic signaling of M2 polarized macrophages on FAPs
function in VML. Aim 3: To test whether co-delivery of pro-regenerative FAPs and MuSC within PEG-4MAL hydrogel
enhance muscle regeneration and functional recovery following VML. Impact – VML is a pervasive clinical challenge with
poor functional outcomes even after gold standard autograft treatment. We will define the critical roles of immune and FAP
cells in this process and develop newly engineered immunomodulatory and regenerative treatment strategies that will
provide a foundation to translate into clinical treatments for VML."

This is a new U01 application to establish a Clinical Center (CC) for a prospective multiethnic HFpEF cohort
from California central valley for deep phenotyping analyses. The investigative team is diverse,
multidisciplinary, and complementary with investigators from School of Medicine, College of Engineering and
College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. The investigative team is highly collaborative and has
strong track records of previous participation in large-scale research networks involving electronic data from
heterogeneous sources, including EHRs, mobile health technologies, and direct-to-participant mailings/web

advantage of the newly developed total-body PET scan at UC Davis to decipher the roles of organ-specific
variations in metabolic syndrome and inflammation in a diverse and heterogenous HFpEF population. One
unique feature of the proposed study is the use of functional connectomics analyses to directly exploit the
heterogeneity in the HFpEF population. Indeed, it is the heterogeneity that provides the necessary data
needed to derive the interconnections to test the critical network drivers, that will provide eventual insights into
potential molecular targets for therapy as well as the unbiased classifications of subtypes of HFpEF. Finally,
functional connectomics analyses enable modular “plugin” of new datasets (e.g., microbiomes), derived from
deep phenotyping analyses from other CCs in the HeartShare Network. Therefore, our proposed study
promises to contribute both technically and conceptually to the overall understanding of the molecular
mechanisms underlying the heterogenous disease in HFpEF."

Accurate cell division is essential for the development of all organisms. During each cell cycle, chromosomes
must be precisely partitioned to daughter cells. Defects in chromosome partitioning generate aneuploidy, the
state where entire chromosomes are gained or loss. Aneuploidy is a the most common chromosomal abnormality
in cancer cells and is thought to be a major factor in the evolution of cancer. It is also the leading cause of
miscarriages and hereditary birth defects in humans. The proposed work will lead to an understanding of the
mechanisms that ensure accurate chromosome partitioning. This work is important for maintaining genomic
stability and preventing human disease. Chromosome partitioning occurs when spindle microtubules move
chromosomes by interacting with kinetochores, the machines that assemble onto the chromosome at a locus
called the centromere. Kinetochores carry out a number of functions, such as maintaining load-bearing
attachments to the ends of microtubules that are continually growing and shrinking. They also control the cell
cycle when there is a defect in kinetochore attachments to microtubules. Our lab will address two fundamental
questions about chromosome segregation using in vitro assays: 1) How is kinetochore assembly regulated? 2)
How do kinetochore proteins contribute to force-dependent kinetochore-microtubule attachments? We will use
budding yeast for these studies because they are amenable to biochemical, genetic and cytological studies, and
the yeast kinetochore is the best characterized to date. Taken together, our work will lead toward an
understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of chromosome partitioning in all eukaryotes."

The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) seeks to strengthen the coordination of innovative research and practice
efforts in maternal health through collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and
their Implementing a Maternal Health and Pregnancy Outcomes Vision for Everyone (IMPROVE) initiative
grantees. The overarching goals of this project are to establish and maintain a Maternal Health Data Innovation
and Coordination Hub to support Maternal Health Research Centers of Excellence, and to facilitate the reuse
of the data they generate. The project will be implemented by a multidisciplinary team of maternal health
experts and biostatisticians at JHU’s Bloomberg School of Public Health, and informatics and data science
specialists at JHU’s School of Medicine, with support from an Experts’ Bureau comprised of subject matter
experts in health equity, bioethics, health economics, patient safety, patient and family engagement in
research. Key project activities are to establish and maintain a secure, cloud-based coordination platform with
controlled access, and a public-facing Data Hub website; develop common data elements using a modified
Delphi approach; support the use of a common data model; provide data collection and analysis tools with
integrated quality assurance workflows; provide support for statistical analyses using traditional and artificial
intelligence/machine learning techniques; prepare and share data with NIH repositories; provide technical
assistance and skills coaching, training, and professional development opportunities to Research
Centers/IMPROVE grantees. Our proposal has technical and conceptual areas of innovation. Most notably, the
proposed integration of the Data Hub with an existing research coordination platform with demonstrated
feasibility -- JHU’s Precision Medicine Analytics Platform (PMAP). It utilizes the Observational Health Data
Science and Informatics (OHDSI) open-source community and the Observational Medical Outcomes
Partnership (OMOP), employed by large NIH-funded research. OMOP is based upon standard clinical
terminologies; enables extraction, ingestion, collation of variables of interest into an observational research
registry; and has the capability for data storage, security, analysis, and transfer among participating sites. Also
innovative are the proposed training and career development opportunities, including tuition scholarships, data
challenge awards, and a mentorship program. We anticipate that these activities will lead to short-term and
intermediate outcomes (e.g. improved data science capabilities; generation of findable, accessible,
interoperable, and reusable data), which, over the long-term, will advance research to improve maternal health
outcomes and promote equity. Process and outcomes evaluations will ascertain the extent to which our project
is successfully supporting Research Centers. Data science methods and findings from research projects will be
disseminated on the Data Hub website, through reports, peer-reviewed articles, and scientific presentations."

Although bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment to promote sustained weight loss and metabolic improvement, they are invasive and can cause severe long-term adverse effects. There is a pressing need for safer and more affordable therapies. A greater understanding of the roles of conjugated bile acids in mediating the metabolic benefits of bariatric surgery may provide the background and direction towards developing new approaches to treat obesity and associated fatty liver diseases. Our preliminary data and the experiments proposed in this application propose to understand how conjugated bile acids regulate metabolism after bariatric surgery. After performing VSG in obese mice, we observe that: 1) VSG induced adipocyte lipolysis and enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation; VSG induces adipocyte browning, as well as induced macrophages conversion in the adipose tissues. 2) VSG leads to a strong increase in systemic levels of conjugated bile acids. 3) VSG induces expression of the hepatic enzymes for bile acid conjugation and alters the gut microbiota (GM), including bacteria with bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. This may contribute to the increase of conjugated bile acids and decrease of un-conjugated bile acid levels in the serum after VSG. 4) conjugated bile acids increased the expression levels of lipolysis markers in adipocytes in a bile acid receptor, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2)-dependent manner; and 5) VSG activated S1PR2 downstream signaling in the white adipose tissue (WAT) of mice. Based on these and other preliminary results, we hypothesize that VSG activates a gut–adipose axis which includes a conjugated bile acids mediated S1PR2 signaling pathway to induce fat loss. We propose two specific aims to test our hypothesis: 1) To determine the effects of VSG-altered conjugated bile acids and GM on adipose tissue lipolysis; 2) To identify the molecular mechanism by which conjugated bile acids promote adipocyte lipolysis. The proposed research will expand our understanding of the molecular mechanism by which conjugated bile acids improve metabolism after VSG. This work will also locate new therapeutic targets and/or probiotics for safe, non-surgical, cost-affordable treatment of metabolic diseases."

Addressing the intertwined crises of opioid overdose and HIV within the criminal–legal system (CLS) necessitates
focused and coordinated public health interventions. To tackle these significant challenges, the National Institute on
Drug Abuse (NIDA) has initiated the Justice HIV and Overdose Research Network, prompting the creation of a
dedicated Coordination Center. RTI International proposes to establish a Coordination Center, termed the EngageData
Hub: Collaborative Solutions for Justice, HIV, and Overdose, leveraging its extensive expertise and resources to foster
effective network coordination and enhance communication across multiple research entities and a patient engagement
resource center (Aim 1). This center will also prioritize comprehensive stakeholder engagement by employing a
conceptually driven strategy to involve diverse and high-risk populations, ensuring that the research is both relevant and
inclusive (Aim 2). Furthermore, the EngageData Hub aims to ensure that research findings are rapidly and effectively
translated into practice, using innovative dissemination strategies to reach professional audiences and community
stakeholders alike (Aim 3). Additionally, the EngageData Hub will facilitate the design and implementation of annual
Rapid Research Projects to address emerging scientific priorities swiftly, adapting Agile methodologies to the research

Landscape fire smoke and birth outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa
Understanding the effect of landscape fire smoke on pregnancy and child morbidity and
mortality in sub-Saharan Africa is needed because this is the region most affected by
landscape fires, accounting for 70% of the total burned area worldwide. Most fires are
agricultural fires (41% of 70% of the burned area), which is distinct from high-income
countries. A recent meta-analysis provided suggestive evidence for an increased risk of
birthweight reduction, low birthweight, and preterm birth in relation to wildfire smoke during
pregnancy. However, the results were inconclusive due to the large heterogeneity in
methods across studies. Available evidence is dominated by studies from the United States
and Brazil. This project is submitted as a 1 year supplement and provides synergies with the
CHaracterizing Effects of Air Quality In Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (CHEAQI-
MNCH) Research Project. The supplement will enhance and expand upon the CHEAQI
aims. CHEAQI, covers air pollution but not specifically landscape fire smoke. We
hypothesize that landscape fire smoke is positively associated with adverse birth outcomes
independent of ambient PM2.5. More specifically the project aims to quantify the association
between landscape fire smoke and birth outcomes in selected cohorts within the HE2AT
centre, a DSI Africa Research Hub. In addition, the project will develop a federated data
infrastructure to include landscape fire smoke in the CHEAQI database, making it easily
accessible for this and future analyses."
11129140,"HIV transmission continues in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), especially among key affected
populations (KAP) and in settings of high stigma and discrimination. In Malaysia, a LMIC in SE Asia, HIV
incidence and mortality is increasing. HIV is concentrated among KAPs, especially people who inject drugs
(PWID), a group that has substantially lower ART prescription and viral suppression (VS) levels relative to other
KAPs, undermining HIV treatment as prevention (TasP) goals. PWID are especially vulnerable to overlapping
and intersectional stigmas due to criminalization drug use and sex work, experiences with incarceration, social
class and the presence of HIV itself. Our preliminary studies confirm high levels of negative stereotypes,
prejudice and stigma toward PWID among medical students and HIV experts, with clear evidence of intention to
discriminate against PWID by withholding ART prescription. Stigma-reducing interventions have mostly centered
on educational and contact-based strategies. Such strategies, however, appear less effective where stereotypes
and stigma are deeply entrenched, as in Malaysia, thus requiring the introduction and testing of alternative
strategies. Behavioral design interventions are potentially effective ways to address stigma in such settings.
Behavioral design interventions use tools like framing, nudges, and choice architecture, which can be used to
re-design how physicians behave – or make non-discriminatory healthcare decisions. Rapid start antiretroviral
(RS-ART) is an evidence-based strategy to initiate ART immediately, thereby supporting TasP goals by reducing
time to VS, achieving VS and improving individual health. It has not been tested among PWID. It fits the criteria
for behavioral design interventions by re-arranging clinician decision-making by first focusing on eligibility criteria
(i.e., presence of opportunistic infections) rather than inaccurate perceptions of ART adherence or
deservedness. Behavioral design interventions have not been tested in HIV stigma research, nor has they been
assessed longitudinally or infusing clinically relevant dyads analyses of patients and clinicians. To guide the
behavioral design of RS-ART among PWID, we will use the Delphi method to develop guidelines. Then we will
use nominal group technique, a rank-ordering mixed method strategy to assess the multi-level barriers and
facilitators to RS-ART for PWID, in order to adapt existing RS-ART protocols for PWID. Once the new guideline
concordant RS-ART protocol is developed, we will pilot test it in 125 PWID over six months and conduct a
longitudinal dyadic analysis of patients and clinicians of stigma, physician trust and social support. The RS-ART
protocol will be refined further during pilot-testing to determine its utility as a stigma-reducing intervention that
can be tested in a future implementation trial. This proposal brings over 17 years of productive collaboration
between Yale and University of Malaya, with expertise in clinical HIV and addiction treatment, participation in
clinical guidelines development, mixed methods research, intervention development and refinement, multi-level
stigma assessment and intervention and dyadic analyses."
11129152,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is presently the leading cause of morbidity and mortality following heart
transplantation. While the pathophysiology of CAV is still unclear, converging lines of evidence point to a critical
role of local immune responses in the graft tissue in this complication. In human CAV, B cell and antibody-
producing plasma cell (PC) infiltrates are consistently observed in or around coronary arteries, yet these
infiltrating cells are still poorly characterized. In particular, the antigen specificity and effector functions of locally
produced antibodies are currently unknown. Understanding how these antibodies contribute to mechanisms of
CAV would undoubtedly facilitate the development of new treatments. Here, we propose to use state-of-the-art
immunoglobulin gene repertoire analysis, single-cell-RNA-seq combined with paired single-cell-IgH+L
sequencing (BCR-seq) to obtain a comprehensive characterization of plasma cells infiltrating cardiac allografts
during CAV. The functional properties and pathogenicity of individual antibodies produced in situ will also be
evaluated using both in vitro cell-based assays and in vivo experimental transplantation models after generation
of recombinant monoclonal antibodies from intragraft plasma cells.
Aim 1. To characterize graft-infiltrating plasma cells in human CAV. Studies in aim 1 will combine IGHV
repertoire and single-cell-RNA-seq analyses to determine the clonal composition and transcriptome profile of
plasma cells found directly at the graft site during CAV. These experiments will also identify predominant clones
expanded in situ. Using an expression-cloning platform, we will generate recombinant monoclonal antibodies
from a large number of plasma cells expanded in the graft infiltrates and identify their specificity.
Aim 2. To determine the function of antibodies produced by intragraft plasma cells. We will focus here on
the ability of antibodies secreted in situ to form immune complexes (IC) and activate FcγR-expressing cells in
the graft. Experiments in aim 2 will use a scRNA-seq approach combined with CITE-seq to comprehensively
map all immune and non-immune cells expressing FcγR in the graft and therefore capable of responding to IC.
We will then investigate whether stimulation of these cells through specific FcγR leads to the engagement of pro-
inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways associated with CAV. Lastly, we will assess whether antibodies secreted
in situ amid CAV can modulate the function of biologically active metabolites they react to (e.g., bilirubin).
Aim 3. To assess the capacity of antibodies produced by intragraft plasma cells to promote CAV in vivo
In aim 3, we will use FcγR humanized mice and a heterotopic heart transplantation model to assess the capacity
of antibodies secreted by graft-infiltrating PC to contribute to CAV in vivo. Moreover, we will use a series of
constitutive or conditional knockout strains to determine which cells and FcγR are implicated in the effect. We
will particularly investigate the involvement of the neonatal Fc receptor FcRn expressed by graft cells as this
receptor was recently involved in IC-mediated inflammatory reactions in autoimmune diseases."
11133575,"Project Abstract
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from abnormal activation of self-reactive T effector lymphocytes (Teffs), which eliminate
pancreatic β cells, Suppression by regulatory T cells (Tregs) is a key mechanism limiting such aberrant autoreactivity.
People with T1D have quantitative and functional deficiencies of Tregs. Recent clinical trials of adoptive transfer of
autologous, ex vivo-expanded, polyclonal Tregs into T1D patients hinted that this may help preserve β cell function.
Our proposal targets enhancement and improvement of the current Treg therapies. We aim to create and validate a
novel, antigen-specific cellular therapy for T1D. Towards this goal, our team engineered Tregs bearing p cell-specific
Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs), to be tested herein. p cell-specificity is conferred by a single-chain variable fragment
(scFv) of an antibody recognizing unique human p cell marker NTPDase3. We hypothesize that β cell-specific CAR Tregs
will home to islets where CARs signaling will enable long-lasting antigen-dependent suppression in situ. We will test this
hypothesis in the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Test existing and newly generated, based on in silico predictions, B3s-CARs with range of binding affinities.
As binding of CARs to p cells that is either too strong or too weak is unlikely to provide adequate activation of CAR Tregs,
we will use computational modeling of our paratope sequence to design mutants with varying affinities to hNTPDase3. The
actual affinities of mutant scFvs will be compared by ELISA verified by surface plasmon resonance, to that of original
scFvB3s. Set of mutant scFvs ranging in their affinities will be built into CARs, transduced into T cells, which will be tested
in culture. CARs inducing, upon antigen exposure, activation, proliferation but not exhaustion ofT cells, will be prioritized.
Aim 2: Engineer β cell-specific CAR Tregs, testing CARs of varying affinities to optimize Treg function in culture
and in situ. We will produce and expand human Tregs bearing various CARs. We will then test them for activation,
proliferation, exhaustion, cytokine release, and the suppression of human islet-reactive Teffs in co-cultures with human β
cells and isolated islets. We will also test our CAR Tregs in situ on the live human pancreatic slices for migration to, and
retention within islets and for the local inhibition of human islet-reactive T cell clones.
Aim 3: Assess the function of islet-specific CAR Tregs in vivo in models of human islet transplants. We will evaluate
the kinetics/ dynamics of CAR Tregs horning and retention within human islets in mice transplanted with these islets in the
anterior chamber of the eye (ACE-platform). We will test the abilities of our CAR Tregs to restrain activity of human Teffs
and to preserve the transplanted islets in both allo- and auto-immune settings. Suppression of alloimmune attack will be
tested in NSG-MHcnun mice engrafted with PBLs and with islets originated from separate donors. Autoimmunity restrain
will be tested in the recently developed humanized HLA-DQ8-restrticed mice transplanted with HLA-matched human islets.
Completion of our project will confirm the feasibility of β cell-specific CAR Tregs, fully characterize them and evaluate
their therapeutic potency, and pave the road for future clinical trials of β cell-specific CAR Tregs in T1D."
11135785,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
The climate surrounding COVID-19 has dramatically reminded us of the dire consequences of being
unprepared for health crises. One looming health crisis is the surge of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections
that are no longer sensitive to our life saving antibiotic arsenal. Thus, this project is leveraged to translate basic
science into antibiotic-sparing medicines for one of the most common bacterial infections in the United States,
urinary tract infections (UTIs), as well as the most common hospital-acquired infection, catheter-associated
UTIs (CAUTIs). The strategy is to develop therapeutics that work equally well against carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae,
including the cause of over 80% of community-acquired UTIs, uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). CAUTIs
pose a significant challenge for healthcare globally. While UPEC causes 50% of CAUTI, other pathogens,
including ESBL and CRE Klebsiella, multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter and Gram-positive Enterococcus
including vancomycin resistant Enterococcus (VRE), cause a significant proportion of CAUTIs. These MDR
pathogens express adhesive factors required for colonization and infection in different host habitats involved in
acute and chronic/recurrent UTIs as well as in CAUTIs. Small molecules and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
will be developed that will treat and prevent disease by blocking these critical host-pathogen interactions. By
acting extracellularly, these antibiotic-sparing therapeutics will be recalcitrant to intracellular mechanisms of
resistance and avoid a common obstacle of cell permeability in drug discovery of small molecules. UPEC,
Klebsiella and Acinetobacter express chaperone usher pathway (CUP) pili tipped with adhesins: i) FimH,
FmlH, YehD, UclD (UPEC); ii) FimH (Klebsiella) and iii) CupD (Acinetobacter). These adhesins are critical for
colonization of the bladder (FimH), inflamed bladder and kidney (FmlH), gut (FimH, UclD and YehD) and
catheters (FimH and CupD). Further, Enterococcus faecalis express EbpA-tipped sortase-assembled pili,
which are critical in CAUTI. Glycomimetics have shown great promise in neutralizing CUP adhesins in vivo to
treat disease. For example, mannosides which neutralize FimH function, are potent therapeutics for treating
and preventing UTI, since FimH is required by UPEC to colonize the bladder. Validating the work in this
proposal, a mannoside has been selected, in collaboration with GSK, to proceed into phase 1a/ab clinical trials
in humans. Also, a FimH vaccine has completed Phase 1a/1b clinical trials. The use of mAbs has
revolutionized treatments for cancer, inflammatory, and neuronal disorders. Therapeutic mAbs have not yet
been fully harnessed for treating infectious diseases, perhaps due to the historic success of antibiotics. In this
project, we will develop therapeutic mAb designed to prevent critical host-pathogen interactions by neutralizing
the adhesins described above. The combined strategies have the potential to produce transformative
antibiotic-sparing therapeutics that work equally well against and antibiotic-sensitive and resistant infections."

Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death globally. It remains unclear why only a small number of
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-infected individuals progress to TB disease. Mtb is known to rewire the
immunometabolism of infected monocyte-derived phagocytes following acute infection. Consistently, systemic
shifts in metabolism are a hallmark of TB pathogenesis, thus highlighting metabolism as a possible target for
intervention. Tyrosine, an aromatic amino acid, is shown to accumulate in the serum of TB patients compared to
healthy controls. However, it is unknown whether and how defects in tyrosine metabolism could mediate
susceptibility to Mtb infection or risk of TB progression. We found that Mtb infection of primary human myeloid
cells downregulates expression of Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH); a key enzyme involved in tyrosine
catabolism. We also identified a genetic variant associated with lower FAH expression in monocyte-derived
dendritic cells (DCs) in Peruvians who progressed to TB. We previously showed accumulation of tyrosine in the
plasma of prospectively enrolled African household contacts of TB patients who progress to TB compared to
non-progressors, consistently with a role for tyrosine catabolism in protection from TB. Importantly, knocking out
FAH in murine macrophages increased their susceptibility to Mtb infection, suggesting that impaired tyrosine
metabolism by FAH may drive loss of Mtb control. Mechanistically, tyrosine metabolites may contribute to the
altered metabolic states of Mtb-infected cells. We hypothesize that Mtb-mediated interference with tyrosine
metabolism has evolved as a mechanism of virulence and could mediate progression to TB disease. We
propose a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments to define the requirement for host tyrosine metabolism
following Mtb infection. We will target FAH using gene editing of primary human myeloid cells to test whether
this key step in tyrosine metabolism is required to contain Mtb infection. We also plan to adoptively transfer fah-
deficient fetal liver cells into TB-susceptible mice to test the requirement for tyrosine metabolism in hematopoietic
cells to control Mtb infection in vivo. Secondly, we will define the metabolic consequences of FAH deletion in
Mtb-infected monocyte-derived DCs and macrophages using metabolic flux experiments, and metabolite
complementation of Mtb-infected FAH-deficient cells. Finally, we will leverage samples and datasets from two
independent cohorts of different TB disease states. The first is a cross-sectional Peruvian cohort of TB patients
and Mtb-infected and uninfected contacts, where we bio-banked plasma samples for targeted analysis of tyrosine
metabolites by high resolution mass spectrometry. The second is a previously described longitudinal cohort of
African household contacts of TB patients followed for 2 years, where we also obtained genotyping data to
explore the impact of polymorphisms in select metabolic genes on expression of tyrosine metabolites. Defining
a causal association between impaired tyrosine metabolism and TB risk would motivate for future trials to
repurpose existing agents to treat inborn errors of tyrosine metabolism as host-directed treatments against TB."
11141430,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Advances in sequencing technologies provide new opportunities to interrogate biological systems from multiple
perspectives. However, the introduction of new technologies highlights a problem many researchers face:
missing data. Missing observations across technologies and biological states is a frequently observed problem
in the field of computational biology. This missingness can be a result of limitations in the technology, the rarity
of a biological state, or because the technology has not been widely adopted. While one technology may have
high sparsity in biological observations, there is an opportunity to leverage existing, complementary data from
an established technology to impute the missing biological observations.
We address these issues by utilizing new methodological advances in machine learning, primarily focusing on
domain adaptation techniques. These techniques learn patterns in one dataset that can be adapted to another
dataset, enabling cross-technology information sharing. Our proposal introduces a general framework in which
domain adaptation techniques can be used to unite an emerging technology with a different, but technology. To
highlight the broad utility of this approach, we apply this model to three biomedical applications: 1) Predict
cell-type-specific perturbation response in rheumatoid arthritis; 2) Predict tissue-of-origin from cell-free DNA
(cfDNA); 3) Predict progenitor-specific gene signatures from cell-free DNA in acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
The proposed aims not only unite existing and emerging sequencing technologies, but enable the discovery of
new biology that is difficult or infeasible to directly observe.
The research proposed builds on my experience in using statistical approaches for transcriptomic data. During
the K99 phase I will require further training from my mentoring team in deep generative modeling (Dr. Casey
Greene), modeling of single-cell data (Dr. Fan Zhang), and modeling of cfDNA and chromatin accessibility (Dr.
Srinivas Ramachandran). The research will be conducted at the University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical
Campus, in the Center for Health AI. In this institution, I will have access to the Colorado Clinical and
Translational Sciences Institute and the RNA Bioscience Initiative, which provide resources for building an
interdisciplinary and translational research program. With this training and available institutional resources, I
will have a solid foundation on which to build an independent research program focused on domain adaptation
applications for high-throughput sequencing technologies."

Epithelial cells are the first line of defense as they interface with the environment and initiate the response to
environmental triggers. Our AADCRC is focused on elucidating the mechanisms by which epithelial cells
contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic disorders. We found that while some epithelial genes are associated
with tissue-specific disease, others are associated with specific combinations of disease and may contribute to
disease progression from one end-organ to another. It is known that allergic disorders show substantial lifetime
comorbidity. The “atopic march” concept has served as a guiding principle in our field, however, it has become
evident that only very small proportion of children follow the traditional atopic march. While early-life AD remains
a major risk factor for the development of atopic disease, there is significant heterogeneity in presentation of the
atopic march including the timing and organ(s) affected. The atopic march needs to be revised to include this
heterogeneity and incorporate the pathogenesis of the various combinations of the atopic march. Our Center is
designed to help fill this critical knowledge gap. In the last cycle of funding, we built the first US early-life
prospective longitudinal cohort of AD (Mechanisms of Progression of Atopic Dermatitis to Asthma in Children,
MPAACH) and conducted mechanistic studies to identify epithelial pathways that promote allergic inflammation
and disease. Our collective preliminary data implicate novel epithelial pathways as key drivers of allergic disease
persistence in a given tissue as well as progression from one tissue to another. Herein, we will determine how
these pathways act to promote the development, persistence, and progression of allergic and inflammatory
diseases. Further, the atopic march needs to be revised to include non-White children. The vast majority of
studies that served as the foundation for the atopic march principle were conducted in White populations, and
our data reveal marked racial differences in the current atopic march concept. MPAACH is comprised of 65%
Black children and was designed to help fill this critical need. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that
homeostatic mechanisms at epithelial surfaces, upon dysregulation, promote allergic inflammation and
contribute to the persistence, progression, remission and resolution of allergic disease(s). This hypothesis will
be tested by three integrated and synergistic projects focused on epithelial cell biology that combine
epidemiologic, basic, and translational research approaches to study multiple end-organs involved in allergic
responses. Integration of data across projects by the Data Integration and Analysis Core (DIAC) will provide
novel insights into a key unanswered question in the allergy field: Why is allergic inflammation restricted to one
tissue in some cases, while it progresses to involve additional tissues in other individuals? Identification of the
epithelial genes/pathways that predispose individuals to specific or shared allergic disorders will empower the
search for therapeutics aimed specifically at the epithelial surface, and the development of treatment and
prevention strategies optimized for allergic disorders alone and/or in combination."

The Src-family kinase Lyn is critical for maintaining immune homeostasis and protecting against autoimmunity,
and deficits in Lyn function are linked to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, cell studies report con-
flicting (paradoxical) inflammatory and immunosuppressive functions, varying by cell and perturbation. We dis-
covered that the two Lyn splice forms (A, B) are differentially regulated, suggesting non-overlapping interactions
and roles, suggesting that the apparently paradoxical positive and negative effects might be explained by iso-
form-specific functions that vary with expression, immune compartment, and environment. We generated single-
isoform LynAKO and LynBKO mice and discovered (1) a dominant role for LynB in protecting against autoimmunity
and (2) a female-specific role for LynA in immune regulation. Our preliminary data point to overlapping roles of
LynA and LynB in steady-state ITIM signaling but a specific role for LynB in inducing antimicrobial hemi-ITAM
signaling. To this toolkit we add a reagent that biases splicing toward increased LYNB production in human cells.
We hypothesize that LynB forms unique interactions in ITAM and TLR complexes, while LynA uniquely sup-
presses ER (estrogen-receptor) signaling, accounting for the sexual dimorphism. Alterations in LynA and LynB
expression will explain the apparently paradoxical observations of net positive and negative functions and sug-
gest a path forward for therapeutic development. 1: Define roles of Lyn isoforms in ITAM, TLR, and ER
signaling in human and murine myeloid cells. As myeloid cells drive autoimmunity and have been targets of
immunomodulatory therapies, they will be the focus of signaling studies. Candidate and unbiased kinase-sub-
strate mapping and interactomics in macrophages and DCs will provide a comprehensive profile of LynA and
LynB substrates and functions in receptor activation. Predictions: LynB will interact stably with ITAM and TLR
signaling complexes and downstream mediators, whereas LynA will uniquely suppress ER signaling. LynA and
LynB will be found to localize differently at the cell membrane, explaining why upregulation of the other isoform
fails to rescue signaling. 2: Define isoform- sex-, and cell-specific functions of LynA and LynB in lupus
progression. We will assess progression of lupus in spontaneous and inducible models in male and female
mice from our Lyn knockout series. WT and LynKO experiments will be repeated mice with ovariectomy and with
pharmacological antagonism/agonism of estrogen, progesterone, and TLRs to pinpoint contributors to sexual
dimorphism. We will assess cell-specific contributions to disease. Finally, we will test the ability of a splice-
altering reagent to suppress disease. Predictions: Upregulation of a single isoform will only partially suppress
lupus, cell-specificity will follow LynA/B expression patterns, sex hormones will drive lupus in females, and alter-
ing LynA/B balance will modulate disease. With our Lyn knockout series, we are poised to resolve longstanding
paradoxes in Lyn signaling. Our Lyn splice reagent adds translational value, testing a new therapeutic avenue."

Silicosis and asbestosis are progressive fibrotic lung diseases causing respiratory failure. Effective therapies are
inadequate in large part due to our limited understanding of disease pathogenesis. It is generally accepted that
fibrosis arises from impaired regeneration of the alveolar epithelium after injury induced by silica and asbestos.
Impaired epithelial regeneration ultimately leads to the activation of fibroblasts to deposit matrix. However, the
critical regenerative defect underlying the pathogenesis of silicosis and asbestosis is unknown.
Regeneration of the alveolar epithelium is orchestrated principally by alveolar type 2 epithelial cells (AEC2s).
AEC2s proliferate then differentiate into AEC1s to restore normal alveolar structure. We and others identified
a novel transitional state transiently assumed by regenerating AEC2s in mouse models of lung fibrosis.
In most mouse models, transitional cells ultimately differentiate into AEC1s with resolution of fibrosis. However,
murine and human silicosis and asbestosis are characterized by persistent transitional AECs with
impaired AEC1 differentiation and nonresolving fibrosis. A fundamental unanswered question is why
transitional cells retain capacity for AEC1 differentiation with resolving fibrosis in most mouse models but persist
in the transitional state with nonresolving, progressive fibrosis in murine and human silicosis and asbestosis.
We hypothesize that in mouse models of resolving fibrosis, proliferating AEC2s exit the cell cycle and
transiently adopt the transitional state but retain the capacity to differentiate into AEC1s, restoring
normal alveolar structure, whereas in silicosis and asbestosis, transitional AECs evolve into a distinct
cell state characterized by specific marker genes and permanent cell cycle arrest, or senescence, lose
capacity for an AEC1 fate, and promote nonresolving fibrosis. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that in
silicosis and asbestosis, transitional cells assuming this novel discrete state lose capacity to differentiate into
AEC1s. We will define 2 subsets of transitional cells in murine and human asbestosis by their transcriptomes.
We will perform lineage tracing to confirm that one subset of transitional cells differentiates into AEC1s,
whereas the other subset persists in the transitional state indefinitely. In Aim 2, we will test whether specific
signaling pathways prevent AEC1 differentiation from the transitional state, in turn activating fibroblasts to
deposit scar. We will subject cell-specific, inducible knockout mice to silica and asbestos. Complementary
studies in primary murine and human AECs will elucidate mechanisms that regulate cell fate and fibroblast
activation. Examination of lung tissue from silicosis and asbestosis patients will confirm disease relevance.
This work will fill a fundamental gap in our understanding of the mechanisms driving fibrosis in
response to silica and asbestos inhalation and overcome a critical barrier to the development of novel
therapies for silicosis and asbestosis."

The HEALTH Research Institute was established at UH to pursue a bold research agenda aimed at addressing
the public health crises health disparities inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Investing in a new NIDA
R25 at UH represents an excellent strategic investment in establishing a diverse pipeline of future substance
abuse scientists given our: (1) central location in arguably the most ethnically diverse metropolitan area
(~44% Latinx, ~26% White, ~23% Black, and ~7% Asian) in the U.S.; (2) one of the only Tier-1 research
institutions with a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) and Asian American and Native American
Pacific Islander-Serving Institution (AANAPISI) designation; (3) ~400 health research faculty and
97 degree programs who will benefit from a research education program that focuses on substance abuse
given Houston’s designation as a high-intensity drug trafficking area (HTDTA); and (4) the institutional
investment in the HEALTH Research Institute which will house this proposed NIDA R25 to ensure it addresses
substance abuse education and research training across the University and beyond. This HEALTH – Future
Addiction Scientist Training (HEALTH-FAST) Program will focus on annually enrolling and advancing the
careers of Doctoral (n=4), Postdoctoral (n=2), and Early Stage Investigators (ESI) Trainees (n=2) – with a
total of 40 Trainees from underrepresented backgrounds in the health sciences across the 5-year funding
period. This will be achieved by the successful completion of 4 specific aims: (1) Identify, select, educate, and
mentor highly qualified Doctoral, Postdoctoral, and ESI Trainees from underrepresented groups in the health
sciences for substance abuse research careers with an emphasis on linkages to ATOD-related chronic diseases
and health disparities; (2) Develop a cutting-edge substance abuse research education curriculum that will
include an array of diverse activities that are reflective of emerging national trends to facilitate an enriching
educational experience; (3) Advance skills needed to effectively disseminate innovative scientific research at
professional meetings and in peer-reviewed journals, while simultaneously accelerating Trainees’
competitiveness to secure NIDA grant funding; and (4) Systematically evaluate HEALTH-FAST processes,
programming, and Trainee outcome data in real-time to demonstrate a NIDA return on investment and inform
data-driven program modifications as needed. Given the proposed transdisciplinary approach to health-equity
science, the HEALTH-FAST Program will leverage Program Faculty Mentors across 7 colleges and 12 academic
units (i.e., Biomedical Engineering; Biomedical Sciences; Clinical Sciences; Electrical & Computer Engineering;
Health & Human Performance; Health Systems & Population Health Sciences; Medicinal Chemistry;
Pharmaceutical Health Outcomes and Policy; Psychological, Health, & Learning Sciences; Psychology; Biology
& Biochemistry; and Social Work) to execute a cutting-edge research education program."

The overall goal of this project is to understand the role of altered glutamine metabolism in breast tumor 
innervation and its connection to brain metastasis. Recent analyses of clinical data have shown that nerve fibers 
are significantly more present in invasive ductal carcinoma compared to both ductal carcinoma in situ and normal 
breast tissue. There exists evidence that glutamine metabolism may promote breast tumor innervation and brain 
metastasis: 1) breast cancer cells express high levels of glutaminase that initiates glutaminolysis by converting 
glutamine to glutamate, 2) cancer-associated fibroblasts upregulate glutamine synthetase expression to meet 
glutamine demands of breast cancer cells, 3) a synergy between glycolysis and glutaminolysis enhances cancer 
cell conversion of glutamine to lactate, which stimulates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) secretion and 
drive neurite extension, 4) brain metastasizing breast cancer cells express post-synaptic marker PSD-95 and 
BDNF receptor TrkB. Yet, the potential to inhibit these several key metabolic pathways and reduce metastatic 
phenotypes in triple negative breast cancer have not been clearly elucidated. To this end, we hypothesize that 
elevated glutamine metabolism by triple negative breast cancer cells promotes breast tumor innervation and 
brain metastasis. To test this hypothesis, we will bioengineer 3D culture platforms to closely mimic the mammary 
tumor microenvironment. To do so, we will develop a tissue engineered model of the mammary tumor 
microenvironment using decellularized mammary tissue as a scaffold to culture 4T1 mouse triple negative breast 
cancer cells, mouse primary adipose stromal cells (ASCs) and mouse primary dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (Aim 
1). We will analyze glutamine metabolic profile of the 3D model of breast tumor innervation by using state-of- 
the-art metabolism profiling tools and exploiting the endogenous autofluorescence of metabolic cofactors (Aim 
2). Finally we will assess the influence of breast tumor innervation on brain metastasis via immunofluorescence 
in vitro and in vivo implantation of DRG neurite-conditioned 4T1s and ASCs (Aim 3). Inhibitors of glutamine 
synthesis, consumption and glutamate production/function will be tested for their ability to block innervation and 
the results will be analyzed in the Data Science Core to evaluate glutamine effects on breast tumor innervation 
in vitro. We will utilize the three cores (Data Science Core for data analysis, Imaging & Spectroscopy Core 
for 3D volumetric time-lapse confocal and multiphoton imaging, and Bioenergetics Core for metabolic profiling 
of in vitro cultures) to achieve strong rigor in study design, execution, analysis and interpretation and improve 
our understanding of breast tumor innervation and brain metastasis. Combined with mentoring by Dr. Tim 
Muldoon and Dr. Robert Griffin, as well as the AIMRC’s senior mentoring committee and other center leaders 
Dr. Song will establish a solid pathway for scientific independence leading to an R01 submission at the end of 
year 2 that focuses on a full scope study echoing the focus of Aim 3 and the long-term project goals."
11137450,"ABSTRACT
Asthma and allergic diseases are among the most common chronic diseases in children and adults, costing
our health care system over $80 billion per year. Rates have been increasing over the past 40 years and
therapeutic advances have been incremental. Over 150 loci have been reported in large genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) of asthma and allergic diseases, but their individual effects are small and these
variants account a small fraction of the overall genetic risk. Moreover, remarkably few of the GWAS findings for
asthma and allergic diseases have led to discoveries of causal variants or causal genes that contribute to
asthma and allergic disease pathogenesis. The latter has been particularly challenging due in part to the
significant clinical heterogeneity of these diseases, and in part to the lag in the development of powerful
statistical, molecular, and immunologic tools for bridging the trajectory from GWAS to gene discovery to
biology to translation. In this application, we propose a robust and comprehensive strategy for identifying
candidate causal variants and their target genes at asthma and allergic disease-associated loci, and for
characterizing (i) their functional effects in asthma and allergic disease-relevant cells types, including bronchial
epithelial cells, airway smooth muscle and lung immune cells, as well as peripheral immune cells, all in resting
and activated states; (ii) their downstream phenotypic effects on both broad categories of disease groups and
traits in the UK Biobank resource and on specific asthma and allergic disease endotypes in deeply phenotyped
ethnically-diverse subjects participating in asthma birth cohorts; and (iii) their immunologic effects in resting
and activated lung lymphocytes and myeloid cells and in “humanized locus” BAC-engineered mouse models.
These goals will be accomplished through a highly collaborative and synergistic program that includes two
projects, a service core, and an administrative core that together will that bridge the trajectory from GWAS to
translation through highly integrated studies by an exceptional team of investigators with expertise in genetics,
(epi)genomics, statistical genetics, and immunology. Achieving these goals will ultimately identify novel drug
targets and the individuals most likely to respond, providing a framework for precision medicine and
personalized treatment of asthma and allergic diseases."
11137486,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The ultimate goal of the proposed work is to develop a novel co-formulation of insulin analogues (e.g. lispro
and aspart) with an amylin analogue (e.g. pramlintide) and with incretin hormones (e.g. liraglutide), to enable a
transformational new treatment for diabetes constituting a true replacement therapy. The most challenging
aspect of optimal glycemic control for the 1.45 million people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the United States is
limiting large increases in blood glucose after a meal. People with type 1 diabetes do not produce the insulin
required for the body to process glucose, so insulin must be replaced by daily injections. Amylin is a small
peptide hormone excreted alongside insulin by pancreatic β islet cells that acts centrally to slow gastric
emptying, suppress postprandial glucagon secretion, and decrease food intake, thus complementing the action
of insulin to regulate blood glucose levels. Similar to insulin, amylin production is completely absent in
individuals with type 1 diabetes on account of their lack of pancreatic β cells. T1D is also characterized by
abnormal suppression of glucagon secretion in response to hyperglycemia. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is
an incretin hormone and neurotransmitter secreted from intestinal L-cells in response to nutrients to stimulate
insulin and suppress glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists
(GLP-1 RAs) have become central to the treatment of diabetes and while these drugs are not yet approved for
T1D patients, GLP-1 RAs appear to be well tolerated in patients with T1D and could have beneficial effects in
both new onset and longstanding T1D patients. As an adjunctive therapy to insulin, GLP-1 RAs can improve
glycemic control and body weight in longstanding disease while also reducing insulin requirements in T1D
patients. Current administration regimens for these therapeutics are highly burdensome as they must be
injected either daily or weekly or taken daily orally. A true replacement therapy, therefore, would administer
both amylin and insulin simultaneously, while also delivering GLP-1 RAs. Unfortunately, Symlin (Pramlintide;
AstraZeneca), the only commercial amylin analogue formulation, is formulated at pH~4 while Novolog (Aspart;
Novonordisk) and Humalog (Lispro; Eli Lilly), insulin analogue formulations, are typically formulated at pH~7.4,
meaning that these formulations are incompatible and must be administered in separate injections. While
treatment of diabetes with separate injections of insulin and amylin analogues at mealtimes has been shown to
be much more effective than insulin alone at managing diabetes, the administration of two separate injections
is burdensome. We have developed a novel polymeric excipient that results in stable, ultra-fast acting insulin,
to formulate insulin and pramlintide together to enable a single administration treatment mimicking endogenous
hormone secretion. Additionally, we can effectively incorporate GLP-1 RAs into these formulations. This novel
combination therapy will yield unprecedented postprandial glycemic control and catalyze the development of a
powerful tool for the management of diabetes affording thus far unrealized therapeutic impact."

Open angle glaucoma is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness worldwide. Yet, the natural
longitudinal trajectory of the disease is not fully characterized because subjects diagnosed with glaucoma are
treated, altering its natural trajectory. A common approach for determining the longitudinal trajectory of
glaucoma is pooling cross-sectional data across a cohort of patients. This approach is mostly affected by the
inter-individual variation and does not capture all of the individual eye behavior. Alternatively, rodent models
are used but due to the extensive structural differences from human visual system the transability value of
these studies to humans is limited. Research in non-human primates (NHP) is of utmost value due to their high
similarity with the human eye and visual pathway. Induction of glaucomatous damage to these animals is
typically performed through initiation of an increase in intraocular pressure, which does not fully capture the
multi-factorial glaucomatous process. It is therefore desirable to have a NHP model with naturally occurring
glaucoma as the spontaneous development of glaucoma indicates the presence of the disease predisposition,
which is at the core of identifying the glaucomatous process without the confounders present in existing
studies.
 We identified a cohort of rhesus macaques that exhibit naturally occurring glaucoma. We propose to
investigate this cohort to answer fundamental questions about glaucoma, specifically focusing on longitudinal
changes that cannot be otherwise addressed in any other setting. We will use a cohort spanning a wide range
of ages and glaucomatous damage severity, along with healthy animals, to test our overarching hypothesis
that optic nerve and retinal structure (including retinal vasculature) as well as intraocular and
intracranial pressure affect the future rate of glaucoma progression. We will determine the natural rate of
structural progression in healthy and suspected glaucoma NHP eyes along with functional progression
(Aim#1). We will establish the spatial relationship of structural changes in the different locations and examine
the effect of systemic and ocular co-variable. In Aim#2 we will establish the macro- and micro-structural
changes in the lamina cribrosa – a porous structure within the optic nerve through which the axons undergo on
their way to the brain – of healthy and suspected glaucoma eyes and their association with optic nerve and
retinal structure and function changes. In Aim#3 we will determine if eyes with fast decline in vascularity are
associated with fast change in the retina and optic nerve structure and function.
 Using this unique cohort, our multi-disciplinary research team will gain knowledge critical to understanding
the disease process. This will improve clinical diagnosis and monitoring, and will be utilized as a reference for
potential treatment. The study sets the stage for future examination of genetic, proteomic, microbiome, and
biomechanics studies to fully characterize central features of glaucoma."

continuation of these underrepresented minority students further into graduate/professional programs and
faculty positions. Therefore, consistent with the mission of the Buffett Cancer Center and the goals of the NCI,
this administrative supplement extension will specifically address the need for cancer research training at the
level of predoctoral, postdoctoral, and early investigator scholars, with a focus on scholars with American
Indian, Hispanic, rural, and/or financially disadvantaged backgrounds. Our objective is to use focused
strategies to enhance the development of these scholars, thereby facilitating their readiness for successful
careers in cancer research and care and their ability to alleviate cancer disparities, and to assess the results of
our approach. Our Specific Aims for this supplement extension are as follows: (1) to sustain the guidance of
diverse scholars into cancer research pathways, (2) to maintain advancement of diverse scholars through
NCI workforce opportunities, and (3) to evaluate and disseminate the outcomes of this Training Navigator
Program. The Buffett Cancer Center is fully committed to attain progress in these Aims during the supplement
period and to sustain these efforts beyond the supplement extension’s conclusion."

 Transitional metals (e.g., Fe, Zn, Mn) are required by bacteria in order to grow. As such, mammals have a
variety of mechanisms to sequester these metals during infection, effectively limiting their availability for use by
bacteria (referred to as nutritional immunity). Yersinia pestis, which causes the human disease plague, needed
to evolve high-affinity metal acquisition mechanisms to overcome nutritional immunity and colonize its hosts.
Because these mechanisms are key to Y. pestis virulence, they represent potential therapeutic targets for the
treatment or prevention of plague. Therefore, our long term goals are to identify the mechanisms used by Y.
pestis to evade host nutritional immunity and define their roles in virulence. Recently, we have made the exciting
discovery that yersiniabactin (Ybt), a siderophore essential for Y. pestis iron (Fe) acquisition, is also able to bind
to zinc (Zn), and contributes to Zn acquisition in vitro. Furthermore, using a hemochromatosis mouse model that
is defective in Fe-mediated nutritional immunity, we demonstrated for the first time that Ybt contributes to
virulence in an Fe-independent manner. Using a Y. pestis mutant defective in Zn acquisition, was also showed
that the host protein calprotectin, which is a key component to Zn-mediated nutritional immunity, is a barrier to
Y. pestis infection, and Ybt contributes to overcoming this barrier in both pneumonic and bubonic plague.
Together, these data are our premise for the conceptually innovative hypothesis that Ybt not only contributes to
virulence through Fe acquisition, but also contributes to Zn acquisition, which aids in overcoming calprotectin
mediated nutritional immunity. In this proposal, we will build on these exciting discoveries. In Aim 1, we will define
the mechanisms that govern metal selectivity of Ybt and the re-acquisition of Ybt-Zn by the bacterium. In Aim 2,
we will define the Ybt secretion mechanisms used by Y. pestis and determine the therapeutic potential of
inhibiting these secretion systems during plague. Finally, in Aim 3, we will define the role of host calprotectin
during plague and the contribution of Ybt to the ability of Y. pestis in overcoming calprotectin mediated Zn
sequestration. Importantly, Ybt is a conserved virulence factor in many Gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, the
data generated from these studies has the potential to provide us with a broader understanding of the role of Ybt
in the virulence of multiple pathogens. Ultimately, these data will provide a foundation for the rational design of
new therapeutic approaches targeting these mechanisms to combat Y. pestis infection."

Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a damaging condition characterized by exposed and necrotic bone in the
maxillofacial region, and arises most commonly in patients taking anti-resorptive medications, including
bisphosphonates (BPs) and anti-RANK ligand antibodies (denosomab). This pathology, which can lead to,
among other symptoms, chronic pain, jaw bone infections, and disfigurement, is most common amongst
cancer patients taking high doses of these drugs, who harbor a ~5% risk of developing ONJ. Treatment
strategies for ONJ vary, but none are without their downsides, making prevention of this condition, and
prediction of its risk all the more important.
Our goal with this proposal is to identify the mechanisms that give rise to ONJ while taking BPs, and develop a
polygenic risk score based on genetic factors that we identify as associated with susceptibility to this condition.
To do this, we will build upon our previous work that identified novel regulators of bisphosphonate function to
investigate how use of these drugs can lead to ONJ. Using genome-wide CRISPR screens, we found over 200
genes that affect the cellular response to BPs, and identified ATRAID as encoding a lysosomal protein required
for the trafficking of BPs. Loss of Atraid inhibits the effects of BPs on mouse models of osteoporosis, and in our
preliminary data, variants in this gene were enriched in patients who developed ONJ.
Our overall proposal applies an integrated approach to (i) elucidate mechanisms that give rise to ONJ,
including which cell types, and which molecules, including ATRAID, are driving this dysregulated response,
and (ii) identify genetic markers of ONJ susceptibility by conducting pharmacogenomic analyses of germline
DNA collected in SWOG S0702, an NCI-funded clinical study that has available DNA and ONJ information
from more than 2000 patients with metastatic bone disease treated with anti-resorptives, ~5% of whom
developed ONJ. We will then validate these genetic loci with high-throughput cellular CRISPR screens using
our previously established BP screening tools. Upon completion of this proposal, we expect to have a
mechanistic understanding of ONJ and a detailed knowledge of the genetic factors that confer susceptibility to
ONJ. These will have a positive impact by providing critical insights that will enable patient-centered treatment
strategies for these drugs that both help alleviate concerns about ONJ among patients who need these drugs,
and reduce the risk of its occurrence."

10768614,"ABSTRACT
In the past three years, we made great progress in understanding the role of mitochondrial (mt) DNA metabolism 
in NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Importantly, we found that NLRP3 itself is activated on binding of oxidized 
(Ox) mtDNA, whose generation depends on new mtDNA synthesis which is stimulated on TLR engagement. 
TLR signaling results in induction of CMPK2, which catalyzes the rate limiting step in the biosynthesis of dCTP, 
a precursor for mtDNA synthesis. We recently discovered that Ox-mtDNA needs to be cleaved by the 
endonuclease Fen1 and transported/leaked to the cytoplasm, where NLRP3 is located, via the mitochondrial 
inner membrane (MIM) MPTP pore and the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) VDAC channel. Macrophage 
exposure to different NLRP3 activators results in rapid Ca2+ influx into mitochondria, as well as perturbations to 
the electron transfer chain that result in mtROS production. Whereas Ca2+ influx into mitochondria leads to pore 
and channel opening, mROS lead to oxidation of newly synthesized mtDNA before it is cleaved by Fen1 to 600 
bp fragments that leak into the cytoplasm. Another important player in mtDNA metabolism is OGG1, a baseexcision repair enzyme that removes oxidized deoxyguanosine from mtDNA, whose insufficiency greatly 
increases Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk. We found that OGG1 ablation in macrophages enhances NLRP3 
inflammasome activation, whereas mitochondrially targeted OGG1 inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We 
therefore we plan to study the involvement of mtDNA metabolism in AD pathogenesis, using the accelerated 
5xFAD model crossed with ApoE4 knockin mutant mice. These mice will be analyzed over the course of disease 
development and progression for CMPK2, NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, OGG1 and Fen1 expression and presence 
of Ox-mtDNA and mature IL-1β in their circulation, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain tissue homogenates. Microglia
(MG) from these mice will be isolated at different time points and analyzed for presence of ASC specs, indicative 
of NLRP3 inflammasome assembly, presence of cytosolic mtDNA and signs of MPTP opening and VDAC 
oligomerization. We will determine whether crossing of 5xFAD/ApoE4 mice with mtOgg1Tg mice results in 
reduced abundance of cytoplasmic mtDNA, Ox-mtDNA and IL-1β and whether this parallels the amelioration of 
neurodegeneration and cognitive loss. Conversely, we will delete OGG1 in MG of 5xFAD/ApoE4 mice to 
determine whether this results in accelerated development of neurodegeneration. We will also cross 
5xFAD/ApoE4 and Cmpk2ΔMG mice, in which the Cmpk2 gene was ablated with MG-specific Cre and determine 
whether this also results in disease amelioration. According to the results of the above experiments,
5xFAD/ApoE4 mice will be treated with newly developed CMPK2 and Fen1 inhibitors and will be evaluated for 
attenuation of neurodegeneration and cognitive loss. Human AD tissue will also be examined for CMPK2 and 
Fen1 expression as well as presence of ASC specs and Ox-mtDNA. These studies will provide us with a
comprehensive view of mtDNA metabolism in AD and will determine whether some of the key steps in the NLRP3 
activation pathway, we had identified, are suitable for therapeutic intervention. In addition to AD, we will assess 
the contribution of mtDNA metabolism to osteoarthritis (OA), a chronic degenerative disease that unlike 
rheumatoid arthritis does not respond to anti-TNF drugs. It has been suggested that NLRP3 activation by 
hydroxyapatite microcrystals is the trigger for OA. We are currently working on the establishment of a robust OA 
model and when it is ready, we will test the effect of CMPK2 and Fen1 inhibition, as well as mtOGG1 expression, 
on disease progression and severity. We will also determine whether mouse and human OA specimens show 
the same perturbations in mtDNA metabolism discussed above. As IL-1β neutralizing antibody was found to 
reduce the incidence of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAC) in smokers, we will also examine whether NLRP3 
inflammasome activation in alveolar macrophages plays a key role in LUAC development and if so will test the 
ability of CMPK2 and Fen1 inhibitors to attenuate disease progression. We will also investigate whether 
macrophage- or MG-specific activation of NRF2 can attenuate neurodegeneration, cognitive loss, OA and LUAC
pathogenesis using mouse models of the above diseases. These studies are based on our preliminary studies 
which show that macrophage-specific NRF2 activation alters macrophage polarization and reduces the 
production of various inflammatory cytokines. We will further investigate the mechanism underlying this outcome 
and determine its association with altered mitochondrial metabolism."
10802292,"Our ongoing and proposed studies are focused on understanding the causes and consequences of the
IgE response to the oligosaccharide galactose alpha-1,3-galactose (α-gal) which is a major blood group
substance of non-primate mammals. These studies are focused on three areas. (i) Understanding the
epidemiology and clinical management of the delayed allergic reactions that occur after eating
mammalian products which are referred to as the α-gal syndrome (AGS). While the syndrome clearly
relates to the distribution of the lone star ticks, Amblyomma americanum, there is increasing evidence that
fire ants can interfere with this tick in the south and also that the range of this tick is moving northwards in
the USA. We plan to use assays to identify the α-gal epitope in food and medicinal products, e.g. CroFab
and heparin. There are many such items that have some connection to mammalian source materials and
could be contaminated. (ii) Full investigation of the serology and cellular responses related to AGS
including comparison with other forms of food allergy. These studies will continue investigating the cellular
basis of the immune response and cellular responses related to AGS using recent development of the
technique of spectral flow analysis. In addition, we propose to extend these studies to a comparison with
other forms of food allergy in particular with Eosinophilic Esophagitis, which like AGS has only become
common over the last 30 years but is immunologically and clinically completely different. (iii) Detailed
studies on two situations, where patients with IgE to α-gal develop either abdominal symptoms or
coronary artery disease without any symptoms that are typically regarded as allergic. Evidence about
these two conditions has developed recently. The relationship to cardiac risk was first reported in 2018
and similar data has recently been reported to a cardiology meeting in Sydney, Australia. Furthermore
investigation of B cells in the circulation of patients undergoing coronary angiography in Virginia has
provided evidence supporting the relevance of B cells to the cardiac risk of α-gal. The abdominal cases
also make up a major percentage of the cases of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in areas of the USA
where bites from the lone star tick are common e.g. Central Virginia. Our plan is to carry out challenges in
these cases with pork meat using α-gal knock-out pork as a blinded placebo to further investigate the
evidence for the association and to further understand the delayed clinical reactions to red meat."
10738800,"Resident MΦs naturally reside freely floating in peritoneal fluid. To counteract the problem that
phagocytosis of cargo is inefficient in fluid, peritoneal MΦs produce Factor V to raise its local
levels and facilitate formation of interstitial clots upon induction of inflammation. The clots in turn
bring MΦs and microbes out of the fluid phase and into a 3-D environment together. This clotting
reaction operates with induced MΦ adhesion onto mesothelial membranes to collectively account
for the classical ""MΦ disappearance reaction"" (MDR). MDR in the peritoneum may also require
inflammasome activation, which may then lead to cell death that accounts for an extended period
of MΦ disappearance. Indeed, when the stimulus inciting the MDR is robust, Factor V+ resident
MΦs disappear for several weeks, likely leaving the peritoneal cavity susceptible to future
infectious and noninfectious threats for rather long durations. We will study possible links between
death and coagulation and use lineage tracing models to determine how resident MΦs repopulate.
Furthermore, we will investigate the idea that the peritoneal cavity is left susceptible to
immunological challenges during the long duration of MΦ loss following MDR. A prolonged period
of MΦ loss following a robust MDR may leave the body cavity vulnerable to infection. It may also
promote progression of other diseases associated with altered immunity, like cancers. In
particular, ovarian cancer is associated with the peritoneal cavity, where it often metastasizes and
expands. Human ovarian cancers are considered one of the most procoagulant tumors. If human
counterparts to the Factor V+ MΦs exist, which we will study herein, such cells might limit tumor
expansion clinically, as observed in mice. Overall, we will test the hypothesis that Factor V+
resident peritoneal macrophages protect the peritoneal cavity from microbial pathogens but also
against ovarian tumors and that the procoagulant activity of these macrophages, if linked to MDR
by a microbial or inflammatory trigger, may set up a state of enhanced susceptibility to tumor
growth due to loss of tumor-restricting MΦs."
11138270,"SUMMARY
 Capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is the outermost barrier between bacteria and their environment. It
shapes bacterial interactions with external factors, including adherence to surfaces (e.g. biofilm
formation, epithelial cell association); protection from environmental stressors (e.g., dehydration, UV
irradiation); susceptibility to predation (e.g., phage, bacteria, or amoeba); or immune evasion (e.g.
opsonophagocytosis). The Klebsiella species complex is comprised of non-fastidious Gram-negative
bacteria that colonize diverse environments, including soil, sewage, sink drains, and mammalian guts.
Klebsiella are early colonizers of the human gastrointestinal tract and, when environmental conditions
shift in the gut, they have the potential to bloom and out-compete all other colonizers, including closely
related Enterobacterales such as E. coli. Clearly, Klebsiella metabolic capacity is robust and flexible.
Moreover, Klebsiella CPS production is required for efficient gut colonization and persistence. There is
a major gap in our understanding of how exogenous signals are transduced through Klebsiella
metabolism and intracellular regulatory networks to control CPS production and how that CPS is
attached to the outer envelope. Our long-term goal is to understand how bacterial control of CPS
biosynthesis and attachment shapes fitness in response to changing environmental pressures at both
single cell and population levels. The objective of this application is to establish a model of the
exogenous and endogenous factors that control Klebsiella CPS biosynthesis and cell surface
attachment. We seek to establish a framework for understanding how Klebsiella and other Gram-
negative bacteria integrate exogenous nutrient signals with their metabolic and regulatory networks to
hone their fitness under varying environmental pressures. Recent progress in the laboratory has
identified specific genes and some environmental signals that alter CPS attachment and abundance.
Our proposed project areas are to examine (1) the mechanisms controlling CPS attachment and
release at the outer membrane and (2) how external nutrient sources and cellular metabolism regulate
CPS biosynthesis. The overall vision of our research program is to develop a model of how extracellular
signals combined with genetic and regulatory heterogeneity create dynamic surface exposed glycans
within a bacterial population to enhance overall fitness in the face of environmental challenges. This will
provide the foundation for identifying potential intervention points that could be targeted to modulate
bacterial CPS production and decolonize specific niches."
10746425,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
The goal of this project is to understand mechanisms of gene regulation in the innate immune response. 
During the past many years, with support from this grant, we have pioneered work with fundamental 
implications to our understanding of inflammatory responses. During the past 5 years, the funding stability 
provided by this MERIT award, enabled us to significantly expand our field of expertise, which resulted in 
several highly significant and unexpected discoveries, which form the basis of the work proposed over the 
next 5 years of the award. In particular, we documented a totally novel nucleic acid binding protein CNBP 
which directs Th1 immune response in vivo and connected lncRNA biology to innate immunity and the 
inflammatory process. In the proposed extension of this MERIT award we will advance on the foundational 
observations that linked Cnbp as a specific regulator of IL12p40 gene transcription by defining in detail the 
molecular mechanisms of Cnbp-dependent control of c-Rel. We will also explore the cell type specific role 
of Cnbp in controlling Th1 immunity using the T. gondii model. Further, we will explore the contribution of 
Cnbp in control of the IL23-TH17 response. Lastly, we will expand on our studies of lincRNA-Cox2 to 
explore regulation of Cox2 and immune responses in vivo."
11141437,"A recent analysis demonstrated that approximately 10% of NIH sponsored clinical trials were being conducted
in Institutional Development Award (IDeA) states. Though reasons for underrepresentation in clinical trials are
likely multifactorial, effective bidirectional communication between IDeA state institutions and clinical trial
sponsors is an important limitation. Sponsors of clinical trials, especially pharmaceutical industry sponsors,
identify a number of key metrics by which a potential site is evaluated for clinical trial site selection. Important
key clinical trial metrics include time required for contract negotiation, time required for IRB approval, time to site
activation, as well as metrics related to study recruitment and retention, and ability to recruit and retain
participants from populations historically underrepresented in clinical trials. The IDeA State Consortium for
Clinical Research Resource Center (ISCORE-RC) was launched in the fourth quarter of 2023 to increase clinical
trials in IDeA states through establishment of a service center to facilitate increased trial offerings and a clinical
research coordinator program to address shortages of trained clinical trial personnel. There are eight ISCORE-
RC charter member sites, and the lack of clinical trials infrastructure to capture relevant trial metrics at these
sites is a limitation to effective marketing to trial sponsors. This supplemental application seeks support for
ISCORE-RC charter member sites to improve their infrastructure by either implementing a clinical trials
management system or generating reports containing key clinical trial metrics from existing clinical trials
management systems. The ISCORE-RC will develop unique action plans for each of the charter member sites
to enable collection and reporting of key trial metrics, thereby enhancing attractiveness for site selection by
sponsors and CROs. This project is critically important to achieving the overarching goal of increasing clinical
trial offerings in IDeA states."
11141471,"Cervical cancer elimination as a public health problem has become a reality if we focus on the uptake of three
evidence-based tools: HPV vaccination, cervical cancer screening, and appropriate follow-up and treatment for
abnormal cervical cancer screening results. Despite multiple efforts, Alabama still ranks third in cervical cancer
mortality and sixth in incidence nationally with great disparities within the state, particularly between urban and
rural counties. In order to address this public health challenge, organizations have come together and
developed a statewide action plan to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem in Alabama by 2033.
This plan was officially launched by the State Health Officer in May 2023 as a partnership between
government, academia, civic, and non-profit organizations and is known as OPERATION WIPE OUT. While
the plan includes specific evidence-based strategies to promote HPV vaccination and cervical cancer
screening/follow-up, the evidence on multi-channel communication interventions (besides provider-focused
interventions) to promote uptake of these tools at the population level is scarce and the results are mixed,
particularly regarding HPV vaccination. We are currently examining the feasibility of a theory-driven, multi-
channel communication campaign to promote HPV vaccination uptake with high school students being agents
of change and preliminary results are encouraging. Thus, the overall goal of this supplement is to expand,
implement, and examine the feasibility and scalability of a theory-driven (Social Cognitive Theory), participatory
multi-channel communication campaign to promote HPV vaccination, cervical cancer screening/follow-up that
is designed and delivered by high school students with the support of OPERATION WIPE OUT partners and
linked to access to these tools (i.e., school-based vaccination, increased access to HPV vaccination, cervical
cancer screening, and follow-up in the community) as well as create a toolkit for other school districts and
Rotary Clubs to implement the program in their communities. Key components will include: (a) continued
capacity building of senior high school students (the ones who are already engaged in the campaign),
providing them with knowledge, skills, and support to mentor junior high school students on the expansion of
the campaign as well as developing an implementation toolkit for other school districts; (b) capacity building of
junior high school students to develop and implement the new components of the campaign; (c) engagement
of parents, teachers, school nurses, and school administrators; and (d) provision of school-based vaccination
and increased availability of HPV vaccination, cervical cancer screening, and follow-up in the community. The
primary outcomes will be: (1) HPV vaccination uptake at the school level. Alabama has a robust vaccine
registry managed by the Alabama Department of Public Health that can provide data on HPV vaccination
uptake at the school level; and (2) Cervical cancer screening uptake by un/under-insured women and
adherence to follow-up at the county level (Alabama Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program)."
11141490,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This revised application is for an Administrative Supplement to the University of Michigan (UM) HEAL Initiative
National K12 Clinical Pain Career Development Program (UM-HCPDP), (K12NS130673). Last year, we
received a supplement to the parent award to add a 4th scholar slot to the year 2 cohort (each scholar is
supported for up to 3 years). However, due to the parent K12 award being a Type 4 mechanism, the original
supplement could only support the 4th scholar for 1 of the 3 years. Now that the parent award has been
approved for the remaining years (i.e., years 3-5), with this revised supplement application, we are seeking
years 2-3 of support for the 4th scholar slot of cohort 2 as well as the funding for a 4th scholar slot in years 3-5
of the parent award.
The short-term goal of this revised administrative supplement is to provide increased opportunities for training
within our existing HEAL National K12 program. The long-term goal is to develop a diverse clinical pain
research workforce that has the skills and content expertise needed to address the existing gaps in clinical
pain science. Our National K12 Program, funded via the HEAL Initiative, began in October of 2022 and seated
its first class of three scholars in June 2023. This first round of applications had far more qualified applicants
than could be accommodated by our existing 3 training slots. In order to keep pace with the demand for better
pain care we needed to both expand the number of scientists who are capable and knowledgeable about the
complexities of pain as well as the breadth or diversity of expertise that can be brought to the table to inform
novel treatments.
With the original supplement, we received the first year of funding for a 4th scholar slot of cohort 2. Now that
the parent award has been approved for years 3-5, we are seeking the remaining funding to support the
addition of a 4th scholar slot to each of the remaining years of the award.
Impact: The impact of adding 1 additional training slot per year will expand the clinical pain research workforce
as well as help to diversify the workforce for greater impact."

This application is being submitted by the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center (MCCCC) to extend the
period of support for the P30 Administrative Supplement for Multi-Channel Communication Campaigns for
Improvements in Cancer Education and Outcomes (MICEO) in Underserved Populations. The MICEO program
will continue to be coordinated by the MCCCC Community Outreach & Engagement (COE) Office and Programs
in three MCCCC catchment areas (CAs): Arizona (AZ), Florida (FL), and the Midwest/Mayo Clinic Health
Systems (MCHS). The MICEO extension builds on the significant progress made through the initial MICEO
funding period. As of June 2024, our reach includes 100+ Hispanic adults in Arizona (AZ) CA, 500+ Black men
in Florida (FL) CA, and 100+ rural adults in the Midwest/MCHS CA. We developed and published the Cancer
Advocacy Handbook in both English and Spanish, with a total of 25 community health educators (CHEs) trained.
Additionally, 25 advocates from other Cancer Centers were trained during the Science of COE Conference, co-
organized by the MCCCC. Focusing on colorectal, liver, lung, and prostate cancers, multi-channel
communication activities were provided to at least 1,000+ general population aged 30 years and above across
the cancer care continuum. The distribution channels employed included print media, virtual tools (including the
Mayo Clinic Connect platform), and both virtual and hybrid events and meetings (cancer conversations), as well
as interpersonal communications (Health Fairs, Farmers Markets, Churches). The primary goal of the initial
(ongoing) supplement was to assess the impact of multi-channel communication campaigns targeting Black,
Hispanic, and Rural populations on cancer prevention, control, and survivorship (CaPCaS). The proposed
supplement extension project will continue to focus on Track 2, targeting the general population aged 30 years
and above. Specifically, the extension will continue efforts for the implementation, sustainability, and
evaluation of the MICEO initiatives across the MCCCC enterprise focusing on: Black men (prostate cancer),
Hispanic adults (colorectal and liver cancers), rural-residing adults (lung and colorectal cancers), and expansion
to include Sexual and Gender Minority health. This extension will enable us to further assess the impact of multi-
channel communication campaigns targeting Black, Hispanic, Rural, and Sexual and Gender Minority
populations on cancer prevention, control, and survivorship (CaPCaS). The specific aims of this extension are
to: (1) expand the implementation of culturally tailored multi-channel communication campaigns for targeted
populations enterprise-wide; (2) foster continuous improvement of MICEO activities based on comprehensive
evaluations focused on assessing the effectiveness of the campaigns; and (3) foster the dissemination,
replicability and sustainability of the MCCCC MICEO initiatives through community and partnership
engagements of local organizations, faith-based organizations. healthcare providers, and other educational
institutions."

Calorie restriction (CR) is defined as eating a nutritionally adequate diet that is below energy requirements. CR
has been studied for almost 100 years and has been found to extend the lifespan and healthspan of numerous
species. Further, when tested in young and middle-aged humans, modest CR improves healthspan and slows
biological aging. However, adherence to CR has been found to decrease over time, calling into question the
long-term viability of this approach. A possible alternative to CR that may have better adherence and
acceptability is time-restricted eating (TRE), which involves eating one's food in an 8 to 10-hour period of the
day. TRE extends the lifespan of rodents, and based on recent human trials, TRE improved disease risk
factors and biomarkers of aging. Further, many benefits of TRE were achieved even when weight loss did not
occur. During the parent award (U01 AG073204), we are conducting a planning project to determine the
feasibility and preliminary efficacy of CR and TRE, which are being delivered via traditional in-person visits and
remotely via mobile health technologies. Data from the planning project will help select the CR intervention and
identify if and what type of TRE intervention will be tested in a future 5-year trial. Our project will also provide
effect size estimates for aging outcomes to adequately power the 5-year trial. The proposed supplement will
support close out funds to complete participants' follow-up appointments, data collection and to ensure safety
monitoring on the remaining participants. The supplemental funds are necessary due to unforeseen costs
incurred by the study, such as increased participant stipends and marketing costs to enrol eligible participants."
11137179,"Compound heterozygous mutations of the DHCR7 gene give rise to a developmental disorder known as Smith-
Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS). The loss of DHCR7 function in these patients disrupts the cholesterol
biosynthesis pathways, resulting in two hallmarks of the disorder: abnormally low cholesterol/desmosterol
levels and high concentrations of the immediate precursor 7-DHC. 7-DHC is the most reactive lipid known to
date, and 7-DHC derived oxysterols are toxic for both neurons and glia. The few current treatments for SLOS
are symptomatic, and largely inefficient. We are focusing on finding a SLOS treatment by which 7-DHC levels
can be reduced and toxicity can be counteracted while conserving residual cholesterol biosynthesis. Our high
throughput screening of 727 compounds with a history of use in human clinical trials revealed that 40 of these
compounds decreased 7-DHC formation in Dhcr7-deficient N2a cells. Following up on initial findings in vitro
and in vivo we found that three compounds were particularly effective in reducing toxic 7-DHC levels –
ziprasidone (ZIP), valproic acid (VPA) and hydroxyzine (HYZ) – both in human dermal fibroblasts of SLOS
patients and in SLOS mouse models. These three compounds act at different sites of post-lanosterol
biosynthesis. Our central hypothesis is that postnatal treatment with ZIP, VPA and/or HYZ will improve SLOS
sterol profile, improving the neurochemical disruptions seen in a SLOS transgenic mouse model, and
establishing a rational basis for the therapeutic use of one of these medications in SLOS patients. We also
propose that the beneficial effects of ZIP, VPA and/or HYZ will be summative or synergistic when combined
with a Vitamin E (VIT-E) rich diet. Finally, in an exploratory high-throughput screening we will attempt to
identify additional, natural compounds that could also counteract the rise and effects of 7-DHC without
suppressing residual sterol biosynthesis. We anticipate that the biological findings we obtain will provide a
framework for follow-up clinical trials on SLOS patients. Furthermore, these medications could also be
beneficial for treatment of other inborn errors of sterol metabolism."
11137237,"Biomaterials are clinically used to replace lost or damaged tissue, but the surgical implantation procedure
initiates an inflammatory response, which is orchestrated by macrophages. The long-term goal is to understand
the signaling pathways used by macrophages to recognize biomaterial features and the resulting inflammatory
processes that lead to tissue healing and regeneration. The objective of this proposal is to determine the
contribution of cell-biomaterial interactions and danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in the regulation
of Wnt ligands, and to elucidate the effect of macrophage-secreted Wnt ligands on T cell activation and stem cell
recruitment and differentiation. The central hypothesis is that macrophages interact with biomaterials and
DAMPs, triggering Wnt release that regulates bone healing by modulating T cell polarization and MSC
proliferation. Our rationale is that macrophage activation is dependent on the physicochemical properties of
biomaterials and the local environment. Macrophages respond to biomaterials by secreting inflammatory
molecules, including Wnt ligands. Ablating Wnt ligand secretion in macrophages decreases their activation and
disrupts the inflammatory response and bone-biomaterial integration. By identifying key signaling pathways that
trigger Wnt ligand secretion, we can identify biomaterial surface modifications and signaling pathways that can
be targeted to modulate and ameliorate the inflammatory process after biomaterial implantation to improve
clinical outcomes. The central hypothesis will be tested in three aims: 1) Elucidate the role of integrin signaling
in triggering Wnt secretion by macrophages in response to biomaterial physicochemical cues.; 2) Establish the
effect of DAMPs in altering macrophage-secreted Wnt ligands; 3) Determine the effect of macrophage-secreted
Wnt ligands on T cell polarization and MSC proliferation and differentiation after biomaterial implantation. We
will pursue these aims using a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies with conditional transgenic knockouts
in macrophages, pharmacological inhibitors, and macrophage adoptive transfer and CRISPR-mediated
transcriptional activation to the activation of endogenous Wnt3a and Wnt5a expression. The study of Wnt
signaling on macrophage behavior and as an orchestrator of the inflammatory response after biomaterial
implantation is innovative and has yet to be studied. The proposed work is significant because it will determine
the role of Wnt proteins in macrophage activation and will provide evidence of the importance of Wnt signaling
in the inflammatory milieu that can be translated into other areas like chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer.
The near-term expected outcome of this work is the understanding of Wnt signaling in macrophage activation
and its contribution to the inflammatory and healing process in response to biomaterial surface characteristics.
Results from this proposal will have an immediate positive impact in establishing the role of Wnt signaling in
macrophage activation and inflammatory response to implanted biomaterials, providing novel targets for the
modulation of this activation and inflammatory response."
11136589,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fungal keratitis (FK) has emerged as a leading source of ocular morbidity and unilateral blindness worldwide.
Though better antifungals are urgently needed, their development first requires an understanding of fungal
proteins/enzymes that could serve as drug targets. The site of fungal growth during FK is the corneal stroma,
which is rich in collagen and other proteins, but ostensibly poor in glucose or freely diffusible nutrients. We
therefore predicted that (1) fungi breakdown these proteins as a primary nutrient source during infection, and
(2) fungal pathways that support protein catabolism (e.g. protease secretion) represent important virulence
factors and putative drug targets. Using a predominant agent of FK, Aspergillus fumigatus, we have confirmed
both parts. First, fungal protease expression was up-regulated in A. fumigatus isolated from infected mouse
corneas, suggesting the fungus is indeed trying to catabolize stromal protein. Second, an A. fumigatus mutant
defective in protease secretion, ∆hacA, was unable to establish corneal infection in the model. The hacA gene
encodes a transcription factor that plays a critical role in the unfolded protein response (UPR), a pathway that
detects and resolves the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and promotes traffic
through the ER-Golgi pathway. This project seeks to follow up these foundational observations and potentially
elevate the fungal UPR as a novel target for FK treatment. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the role of HacA within
the infected cornea. First, we will determine if cell wall alterations associated with the hacA mutant influence
host-fungal interactions and pro-inflammatory signaling. Second, we will determine the impact of repressing
hacA expression on disease progression/resolution. Specifically, we will infect mice with a strain of A.
fumigatus in which hacA expression can be repressed through the addition of doxycycline. In this way,
infected corneas will be ‘treated’ with doxycycline and the effect on fungal growth, inflammation, and corneal
damage will be monitored. In Aim 2, we will test the feasibility of repurposing a mammalian UPR inhibitor for
treating FK. The compound of interest, 4µ8C, inhibits Ire1, which signals upstream of the HacA ortholog in the
UPR pathway. As the UPR plays a critical role in cytokine secretion, it follows that 4µ8C dampens the
inflammatory response. We have further established that the Ire1 ortholog in A. fumigatus is essential for
growth, and the 4µ8C displays antifungal effects in vitro. Accordingly, we will test whether 4µ8C can be used
as a dual-edged treatment to block both fungal growth and damaging inflammation in our mouse FK model.
Finally, it is clear that the A. fumigatus UPR regulates downstream genes/proteins that are critical for corneal
virulence, but these targets remain largely uncharacterized. In Aim 3, will employ both chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) on the HacA protein as well as RNA-seq (WT vs. ∆hacA) following growth in a
3D corneal model. In doing so, we will identify genes under direct and indirect control of the UPR. The
characterization of these genes and their role in corneal virulence will serve as the basis for future inquiry."

Emerging adults attending community college are an underserved population at risk for poor sexual health
outcomes. Compared to students at 4-year institutions, community college students are more likely to
experience unintended pregnancy and STIs and are less likely to have access to comprehensive sexual health
resources. Additionally, emerging adults in this population are voracious and adept media consumers and
producers, and media have an important influence on emerging adults’ relationships and sexual health.
Community college students make up almost half of the college population, but relatively little research has
focused on their sexual health and media use, and to our knowledge no research has done so longitudinally
across emerging adulthood. As part of R01HD099134 (PI: Scull), we have recruited a large sample of young
community college students from across the U.S. (N=1647) to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief media
literacy education program for promoting sexual health. Measures on the baseline and 1-year follow-up
questionnaire include attitudes, normative beliefs, and behaviors related to sexual health and media. The
sample is diverse with respect to race-ethnicity, gender identity, and sexual orientation. As part of the proposed
project, we will leverage this existing sample to conduct a rigorous longitudinal cohort sequential design to
accomplish three Aims. In Aim 1, we will examine sexual health and quality of life trajectories of community
college students (total N=2247) across emerging adulthood (from age 18 to 24), including the moderating
influence of developmental contexts: gender and sexual identity, education, employment, relationships,
housing, health, and socio-structural barriers. In Aim 2, we will conduct the first longitudinal examination of
the reciprocal relationship between media use and sexual health across emerging adulthood with attention to
how critical media message processing may moderate this relationship and protect emerging adults from
harmful media influence. Finally, in Aim 3, we propose an innovative mixed methods design with purposive
sampling and multiple points of qualitative and quantitative data integration to better understand how
community colleges can create more inclusive and affirming environments to support the sexual health of
sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY). We will use quantitative data on community college resource
availability and quality, conduct in-depth interviews with 30 diverse SGMY, and utilize member checking to
contribute to validity of our results. An advisory panel of community college administrators will review
recruitment and data collection protocols, assist with efficient study dissemination, and form the beginnings of
a network of key stakeholders invested in promoting the sexual health of community college students. Findings
from this study will inform college resources and policies – beginning the process of enacting structural change
to better meet the sexual health needs of the rising generation of diverse emerging adults attending community
college across the U.S."
11136789,"Obesity prevalence can be reduced by individual-focused lifestyle interventions as these interventions are 
generally effective at helping people lose weight. However, some people who engage in these interventions 
lose less weight than others. This variability in weight loss may be influenced by psychological factors, such as 
perceived stress, that play a key role in behavior change. Fluctuations in daily stress and ability to cope with 
this stress (i.e., coping) can negatively impact behavior, and potentially initial weight loss. Nevertheless, 
successfully assessing this relationship on the day-to-day level has been difficult and with limited assessment 
especially among participants who are trying to change behavior (e.g., behavioral weight loss program). These 
limitations can be addressed by ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methodology which assesses these 
daily psychological constructs and behaviors in real-time and across multiple days. Intensive longitudinal 
assessment with EMA of these psychological factors and daily behavior can inform the design of adaptive 
interventions that can intervene in real-time to change behavior and improve weight loss success. To this end, 
the overarching aim of this study is to elucidate mechanisms of stress and related concepts with subsequent 
health behaviors during a behavioral weight loss intervention. To thoroughly assess the mechanism, this study 
will conduct EMA measures at multiple timepoints within diverse participants who have engaged in a 
community-based weight management program. Specifically, we will examine the association between 
variability in individual stress and weight loss across a behavioral weight loss program (Specific Aim 1). We will 
test the hypothesis that high variability in daily stress will be related to less weight loss (Hypothesis 1a), and 
less physical activity and sleep across the initial (3-months) and full program (6-months, Hypothesis 1b). We 
will also examine the association between variability in daily coping and positive affect, and weight loss across 
the behavioral weight loss program (Specific Aim 2). We will test the hypothesis that individuals with high 
variability in coping and positive affect will be related to less weight lost across the initial and full program 
(Hypothesis 2). The results from our study will advance our understanding of stress, coping, and affect during a 
weight loss program, and lead to the development of an ecological momentary intervention to improve stress 
and mental health while engaging in a behavioral weight loss program supporting long-term behavior change 
and weight loss success."
11137499,"Aortic aneurysms are often silent and deadly, and there is no medical therapy for them. Veterans,
especially those who smoke (nicotine), are highly vulnerable to aortic aneurysms and their sequelae such as
ruptures and dissections. Thus, understanding the fundamental basis for the disease is central to developing
cures that can have a positive impact on health of veterans.
 Studies in human cohorts show that the non-coding microRNA-204 (miR-204) is downregulated in aortic
aneurysmal tissue compared to non-affected tissue. In addition, human population-based studies have shown
increased prevalence of aortic aneurysms and risk of their rupture with use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. These
antibiotics are widely (and often inappropriately) prescribed in the VA Health System. Antibiotics change the
composition of the healthy gut microbiome (dysbiosis). This application will test the hypothesis that gut dysbiosis
caused by antibiotics promotes aortic aneurysms via its effect on aortic miR-204 expression.
 Dedifferentiation of smooth muscle cells from a normal contractile phenotype to a dysfunctional
synthetic one, is a core feature in diseases of arterial remodeling, including aortic aneurysms. Synthetic smooth
muscle cells preferentially utilize fat over glucose. This application will also explore the hypothesis that
downregulation of miR-204 causes switching of aortic smooth muscle cells from a contractile to a dysfunctional
synthetic phenotype by stimulating fatty acid utilization.
 The hypotheses underlying this application are grounded in exciting data showing that aortic miR-204
expression is governed by the gut microbiome – dysbiosis caused by broad-spectrum antibiotics leads to
profound decrease in aortic miR-204 expression. In addition, absence of miR-204 in mice makes them
susceptible to Angiotensin II-induced aortic aneurysmal dilatation and upregulates metabolites in the fatty acid
oxidation pathway.
 This application will leverage state-of-the-art molecular tools and genetically modified mice to examine
the role of smooth muscle miR-204 in Angiotensin II-induced and nicotine-induced aortic aneurysms. It will
determine if antibiotic-induced dysbiosis down-regulates aortic smooth muscle miR-204 and promotes aortic
aneurysmal disease, and whether this disease can be rescued by gain-of-function of miR-204. It will explore the
role of miR-204 in regulating the plasticity of smooth muscle cells and investigate whether loss of function of
miR-204 promotes dedifferentiation of aortic smooth muscle cells in aneurysmal disease. Additionally, using
metabolomics and bioenergetic tools, it will uncover the role of miR-204 in regulating smooth muscle cell
preference for fuel utilization, and investigate if deficiency of miR-204 in aortic aneurysmal disease increases
smooth muscle fatty acid oxidation.
 Aortic aneurysms are common and represent a significant health burden in veterans. This application
offers a unique opportunity to explore how a vascular microRNA regulated by gut bacteria is involved in the
pathogenesis of aortic aneurysmal disease and could offer hope for new therapies for veterans who suffer from
this disease."

The Multiethnic Observational Study in American Asian and Pacific Islander Communities (MOSAAIC) is a
pioneering initiative proposed to address significant gaps in health research for Asian American, Native
Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander populations. Historically underrepresented in biomedical research, these groups
face unique health challenges and disparities that require targeted investigation. The National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute (NHLBI) has initiated this comprehensive longitudinal cohort study, involving 10,000
participants, to transform our understanding of cardiometabolic and mental health disparities within these
populations.
We propose to collect and analyze PAXgene RNA and Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) from
10,000 participants to advance our understanding of cardiometabolic and mental health disparities in Asian
American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander populations.
PAXgene Collection and Analysis (Aim 1): We will collect PAXgene RNA tubes from participants during both
the UG and UH phases. The central lab service will supply the tubes to the Clinical or Community Field Studies
(CCFCs). Tubes will be stored following the standard protocol to ensure sample integrity and then shipped to
the central lab for RNA extraction. This high-quality RNA will be used for whole-blood transcriptomics to
identify gene expression patterns and provide insights into health disparities. Advanced bioinformatics tools will
integrate these data with other genomic and clinical data to uncover biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
PBMC Collection and Analysis (Aim 2): We will collect PBMCs from 9,500 participants during the UH
phases. The central lab will provide the necessary materials, and the CCFCs will process whole blood samples
to isolate PBMCs. We will then isolate specific cell subsets for transcriptomics analysis, measure immune cell
distributions using multiparameter flow cytometry, and assess immune function by exposing PBMCs to specific
stimuli. Additionally, we will explore transforming PBMCs into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for organ-
specific research, enabling detailed investigations into the unique biological characteristics of these
populations and informing targeted interventions."

Dr. Hsue is one of the few cardiologists in the world with both extensive research and clinical expertise in HIV
and has devoted the last 15 years studying cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the setting of HIV. The initial part
of her career was spent 1) establishing a HIV Cardiology Clinic at Zuckerberg San Francisco General (ZSFG),
2) developing the infrastructure to perform patient oriented research in Cardiology including development of a
vascular laboratory for clinical research, 3) performing studies that evaluate the mechanisms underlying HIV
infection and CVD and 4); leading clinical trials aimed to reducing inflammation and CVD risk in HIV. The
findings from her work have shown that 1) HIV infection is independently associated with CVD, independent of
traditional risk factors or ART and 2) chronic inflammation in the setting of effectively treated HIV infection
underlies this increased CV risk. Initial K24 support has led to a significant increase in the number of mentees,
grants, and publications for Dr. Hsue and new research directions including use of novel imaging to assess
HIV disease burden and identification of therapies to reduce HIV-associated inflammation and CV risk. For the
K24 renewal period, her career goals are to perform cutting edge clinical/translational studies and mentoring
that will lead to improvements in treating, identifying and preventing CVD among PLWH and also impact other
comorbidities and HIV cure. Dr. Hsue plans to 1) expand her research to include the role of somatic mutations
in the hematopoietic system (termed clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, CHIP) and proteomics in
HIV-associated CVD; 2) continue her time spent mentoring junior investigators in the fields of HIV infection,
inflammation, and CVD with a focus on transition to full-independence; 3) obtain leadership training to build
clinical and translational research programs that can be used by mentees and will make her a better mentor.
The majority of Dr. Hsue's career development will occur at UCSF which offers outstanding resources for
clinical/translational research, basic science, imaging, HIV, and mentoring/leadership training. Her K24
proposal will extend upon her current NIH-funded investigations by studying the underlying mechanism of HIV-
associated atherosclerosis in treated HIV with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1A: To determine if clonal
hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) mutations are more prevalent in peripheral blood cells of
PLWH vs. uninfected controls; Aim 1B: To determine whether the presence of CHIP mutations are associated
with increased arterial inflammation and metabolic activity of the hematopoietic system as assessed by FDG-
PET/CT; Aim 2A: To identify a unique proteomic signature in PLWH that is associated with arterial
inflammation and metabolic activity of the hematopoietic system, and Aim 2B: to characterize changes in
proteins and biological pathways that are altered after anti-inflammatory and lipid interventions. This proposal
will provide subject visits, imaging, and clinical and laboratory data to support new investigators in clinical/
translational research in the field of HIV-related CVD and HIV disease pathogenesis including cure."

More research on the multi-level factors impacting the higher prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease
and related dementias among Black adults is critically needed. The overall goal of this project is
to increase our understanding of the biopsychosocial factors that impact cognitive outcomes in a
cohort of 600 longitudinally followed middle-aged and older Black adults (aged 55+). This cohort,
referred to as the Black American United Memory and Aging Project (BA-UMAP), will be
established and maintained remotely using an innovative online, faceless enrollment and data
collection strategy, and will involve: (a) a comprehensive assessment of biopsychosocial factors
through online questionnaires; (b) annual cognitive assessments, administered remotely via
computer and mobile devices; (c) the remote collection of non-invasive saliva and urine samples
at baseline and Year 4; and (d) the utilization and integration of digital media platforms for creating
a virtual community that provides outreach and education, and fosters trust. The overall objectives
of this study are to: (1) prospectively evaluate cognitive functioning and identify preferences for
remote cognitive assessment modalities; (2) identify sociocultural, behavioral, and environmental
factors associated with cross-sectional cognitive functioning and longitudinal cognitive decline,
and (3) examine the association of acquired biological risk factors, inclusive of family and health
history, and salivary and urine biomarkers, to cognitive functioning and cognitive decline. This
research is a necessary step in understanding the etiology of cognitive decline in this growing
population, for informing relevant intervention strategies, reducing dementia rates and disparities,
and ultimately advancing health equity."

10833593,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Of the ~200,000 infants S90 days old evaluated for fever annually in U.S. emergency departments (EDs), ~2%
will harbor invasive bacterial infections (I Bis), defined by bacteremia and/or bacterial meningitis. To reduce
unnecessary invasive procedures and hospitalizations, clinicians frequently rely on prediction rules to identify
febrile infants at low risk of I Bis who may be safely discharged from the ED without lumbar punctures (LPs) or
empirical antibiotics. Newer clinical prediction rules such as the Step-by-Step approach, Pediatric Emergency
Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) prediction rule, and IBI score have high sensitivity for IBI in febrile
infants and potentially obviate the need for LPs. However, these rules have been derived, validated, and/or
studied exclusively in febrile infants S60 days old or in cohorts with few infants 61 to 90 days old with IBI. The
recently published American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and
management of febrile infants only addresses infants 8 to 60 days old due to the lack of evidence regarding
febrile infants 61 to 90 days old. Consequently, there is wide variation in the management of these infants. In
addition, although bacterial meningitis is rare in this age group, ~18% of febrile infants 61 to 90 days old
undergo LPs, and 16% are hospitalized; at some hospitals, the proportion approaches two-thirds.
Nevertheless, I Bis occur in approximately 1 % to 1.5% of febrile infants 61 to 90 days old, which underscores
the need for risk stratifying these infants to identify those with non-negligible risk of IBI who require LPs and
hospitalization. The long-term goal of this research is to improve the management of febrile infants 61 to 90
days old by providing clinicians with an evidence-based risk stratification tool. The objective of this proposal is
to derive and internally validate such a clinical prediction rule using objective demographic, clinical, and
laboratory data to identify infants at low versus non-negligible risk of IBI. To accomplish this objective, we will
use the PECARN Registry, which includes data from >5.5 million visits from 12 EDs in 9 health systems,
including nearly 14,000 visits for febrile infants 61 to 90 days old. Recursive partitioning analysis will be used to
derive the clinical prediction rule with 10-fold cross internal validation.
Collectively, the investigative team is well-positioned to conduct this research with expertise in febrile infants,
clinical prediction modeling, and natural language processing. The principal investigator, Paul L. Aronson, MD,
MHS, has studied febrile infants for a decade, including the derivation and internal validation of a prediction
rule for febrile infants S60 days old. After the derivation and internal validation of a highly sensitive and specific
prediction rule for febrile infants 61 to 90 days old at risk for IBI, the rule will be externally validated in a
multicenter prospective study conducted through PECARN. Ultimately, this novel clinical prediction rule will
provide clinicians with an evidence-based tool to target LPs and hospitalizations to febrile infants 61 to 90 days
old at the highest risk of IBI while avoiding these unnecessary procedures for infants at low risk of IBI."
10848261,"ABSTRACT
It is well established that low levels of dietary folic acid are associated with an increased risk of neural
tube defects. However, no other dietary nutrient has been clearly associated with birth defects. We propose to
use the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) to assess the association between maternal diets
low in omega 3 fatty acids and birth defects.
The NBDPS, one of the largest population based studies of birth defects, interviewed 40,029 US
mothers who delivered infants between 1997 and 2011. It includes 50 clinically well defined birth defect
phenotypes. Dietary information was collected using a 58-item food frequency questionnaire developed by
Willett and colleagues for The Nurses Health Study.
In a preliminary analysis of NBDPS data for approximately 20,000 pregnancies, 31 percent of
mothers reported eating little or no fish (a leading source of omega 3 fatty acids). This analysis
examined 22 birth defects and observed that mothers who consumed as little as 1-3 servings of fish
per month had a lower risk of having offspring with 5 of these birth defects. In addition, a small case control
study found that mothers who consume diets high in fish have a reduced risk of heart defects.
We are requesting support to undertake analyses of the final NBDPS database of 40,009 pregnancies.
We will assess associations between three different levels of fish consumption (1-3 servings per month, 1 serving
per week and 2 or more servings per week) and 50 different birth defect phenotypes. We will also assess
associations between three other measures of maternal intake of omega 3 fatty acids and 50 birth defects,
including two measures of plant sources of dietary omega 3 fatty acids.
This project entails 1) coding of responses for up to 4,000 dietary supplements, 2) main analyses of 200
adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, 3) testing multiple regression models to evaluate confounding
and 4) analyses of sensitivity and bias. Including the 2 sensitivity analyses and the analyses of misclassification
bias, we will calculate 650 adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.
The observation many women eat little or no fish, suggests that the percent of birth defects that may be
explained by low fish consumption in the US could be relatively high compared to countries where fish
consumption is higher. However, many women prefer not to eat fish because of concerns about the environmental
contaminants that bio-accumulate in them. Hence it is important to not only understand the effect of fish
consumption on birth defects but to also understand the effect of dietary intake of omega 3 fatty acids from plant
sources on birth defects. We hypothesize that intake of plants rich in omega 3 fatty acids may also be protective
against birth defects and could therefore serve as an alternative source of protective omega 3 fatty acids."
10815730,"Project Summary
Myogenic defects, which includes congenital heart malformations as well as congenital muscular dystrophies
are the most prevalent classes of birth defects in the human population, with an incident rate as high as 10 in
1000 live births. A significant number of these cases are termed sporadic, which are largely the result of
interactions between a number of independent genetic loci and alleles. To aid in our understanding of the
polygenic nature of congenital myogenic defects, it remains imperative to continue to identify new gene
regulatory partners that may play a role in the process of embryonic heart and skeletal muscle patterning. Our
laboratory has recently identified a cofactor, Akirin, that is responsible for interfacing transcription factor activity
with chromatin remodeling machinery to facilitate gene expression during a variety of skeletal myogenic and
cardiogenic processes. To date, the number of developmentally critical transcription factors known to interact
with Akirin remains frustratingly low, despite the myriad developmental processes known to require Akirin for
proper function. Excitingly, our preliminary data suggests that Akirin likely regulates insect embryonic heart
development and/or skeletal muscle development through interactions with the GATA-family member Pannier,
a zinc finger transcription factor identified as key for embryonic segmentation as well as cardiomyoblast
specification.
This project therefore involves simultaneous pursuit of two related specific aims: 1) Using a combination of
genetic, biochemical, and live imaging techniques, will confirm the importance of Akirin/Pannier interactions
during development, and 2) We will deploy a focused candidate screen for Akirin interacting loci, based on a
small number (25) of predicted Akirin interactors. This work will provide key data for understanding the role of
Akirin in the process of skeletal muscle and heart formation, and generate a further list of Akirin-interacting locian
Akirin interactome- that will shed light on other myogenic regulatory nodes that require Akirin.
Critically, in keeping with the goals of the Su RE award mechanism, this project will support the research
activities of the Pl, whose previously NIH-supported laboratory has an established track record of recruiting
talented undergraduate researchers from diverse backgrounds. Members of the Nowak Laboratory gain
hands-on experience in a wide variety of molecular, genetic, histological, microscopic, and biochemical
techniques, and are actively involved in not only project conception and execution, but also dissemination of
results and findings through conference presentations and authorships on peer-reviewed manuscripts."
10867411,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Group 1 CD1-restricted T cells are a subset of the unconventional T cells that recognize lipid and glycolipid
antigens presented by CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c molecules. The role of group 1 CD1-restricted T cells has been
best established in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in which a wide variety of lipid antigens have
been identified. Analysis of the T cell response during human Mtb infection indicated that infected individuals
have increased CD1-restricted T cell responses to lipid antigens compared to Mtb na""ive controls. CD1 brestricted
T cells present in bronchioalveolar fluid were shown to limit Mtb growth ex vivo and the frequency of
these polycycotoxic Mtb lipid-reactive T cells correlated with protection from active tuberculosis disease.
Furthermore, we have previously shown that Mtb lipid-specific group 1 CD1-restricted T cells were able to
expand during Mtb infection in humanized CD1 transgenic (hCD1Tg) mice. Adoptive transfer of transgenic T
cells specific to mycolic acid presented by CD1 b led to decreased bacterial burden in Mtb-infected Ragdeficient
mice in a group 1 CD1-dependent manner. Taken together, these studies show that Mtb lipid-specific
group 1 CD1-restricted T cells are an important component of the cellular immune response to Mtb.
While most of group 1 CD1-restricted T cells express diverse αβ TCRs, most humans harbor a population
of CD1b-restricted T cells known as ""germline encoded mycolyl-reactive"" (GEM) T cells that express an
invariant TRAV1-2-TRAJ9 TCR-α chain. GEM T cells show high affinity binding to CD1b/glucose
monomycolate (GMM) and secrete IFN-γ and TNF-α in response to GMM stimulation. To investigate the in
vivo function of this conserved CD1b/GMM-specific T cell subset during Mtb infection, we generated a hCD1Tg
background TCR transgenic mice encoding GEM TCR specific for CD1b/GMM. In Aim 1, we propose to
determine if the expression of CD4 or CD8 co-receptor affects the antigen response of GEM T cells. In
addition, we will assess the ability of GEM T cells to traffic to the lung and confer protection against Mtb
infection. The effector functions important for GEM T cell-mediated anti-mycobacterial immunity will also be
evaluated. In Aim 2, we propose to address whether GEM T cells have the capacity to generate memory T cell
responses. We will use a novel vaccination and re-challenge model that allows for complete clearance of an
attenuated Mtb strain prior to challenge with fully virulent Mtb to study memory GEM T cell responses. Using
this approach, we will compare the activation kinetics, tissue localization, and effector functions of GEM T cells
during primary and secondary response to Mtb infection. We will also analyze gene expression profiles of
memory GEM T cells and compare to that of conventional memory T cells. Collectively, these studies will yield
a better understanding of how group 1 CD1-restricted T cells contribute to the overall immune response
against Mtb and whether they can be targeted for the development of lipid antigen-based Mtb vaccines."

Ending the HIV Epidemic will require multi-sectoral efforts to maximize the dissemination and availability of HIV
testing and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Pharmacies can fill an important gap in delivering PrEP to
populations affected by HIV and have many advantages over conventional clinic-based care models, including
increased accessibility, established community trust, and experience providing medication counseling. The
overarching goal of this supplement application is to advance the science of implementing pharmacy-based
rapid HIV testing and PrEP, two evidence-based practices that remain underutilized among populations
affected by the HIV epidemic. This study will examine key questions regarding the implementation of
pharmacy-based rapid HIV testing and PrEP initiation in communities with high burden of HIV in Philadelphia,
PA, an urban area prioritized by the Ending of HIV Epidemic initiative. We hypothesize that a pharmacy-based
PrEP delivery model will be acceptable, feasible, and appropriate and that individuals will uptake pharmacy-
based PrEP. The study will pursue three research aims:
Aim 1: Identify implementation barriers and facilitators of pharmacy-based HIV testing and PrEP initiation.
Informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and the Health Equity
Implementation Framework (HEIF), we will conduct a mixed methods study using in-depth interviews with
stakeholders and a survey of pharmacists to identify implementation determinants and assess implementation
readiness of pharmacy-based PrEP.
Aim 2: Determine optimal implementation strategies for pharmacy-based HIV testing and PrEP delivery. We
will conduct focus group discussions with pharmacists and stakeholders to determine optimal strategies and
mechanisms to maximize implementation success of the intervention.
Aim 3: Evaluate the implementation of a community-based, pharmacist-led HIV testing and rapid PrEP
initiation intervention. Using the Proctor framework of implementation outcomes, we will pilot the intervention in
community pharmacies and conduct a mixed methods study to assess acceptability, feasibility,
appropriateness, and reach of the program.
The research will be implemented through a collaborative effort with partners from the Penn Center for AIDS
Research, Philadelphia Department of Public Health, Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, and local community
pharmacies. Completion of research aims will provide key data on an adaptable model for widespread
implementation of pharmacy-based HIV testing and PrEP. Moreover, the project will support local EHE efforts
by capacitating pharmacists to provide rapid HIV testing and promptly initiate PrEP. Evidence and insights
generated from this research will be used to test the efficacy of the intervention at scale in a Type II hybrid
effectiveness-implementation clinical trial."

A key barrier in using neurophysiological data for research is the crushing computational burden involved in
processing large volumes of complex signal data, typically in European Data Format (EDF). The goal of this
project is to create an AI-ready resource of semantically annotated collection of electroencephalogram (EEG)
recordings and sleep polysomnography data, called the Neurophysiological AI-Ready Data Resource
(NAIRD), to transform the access and sharing of such resources for brain health research. NAIRD will
leverage data sources from prior repositories that cover two major brain health domains: epilepsy, as a part
of the Center for Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) Research (CSR), and sleep, as a part of
the National Sleep Research Resource (NSRR). NAIRD will make this rich collection of electrophysiological
signals with associated individual-level health outcomes not only FAIR (Findability, Accessibility,
Interoperability, and Reusable), but also interactable and AI-ready. Pre-computed innovative features will be
readily available with raw data source in a way that is free from redundant-processing needs using our future-proof data format in a scalable database environment. This overall goal will be achieved through four Aims:
Aim 1: Develop and operationalize a future-proof, universal self-descriptive sequential data format (U2S) to
represent neurophysiological data, with a web-based interactive visualization interface for on-the-fly creation
of user-specified data subsets; Aim 2: Convert the prospectively acquired Center for SUDEP Research data
collection to U2S format and import the converted data to WaveSphere, our NAIRD data access platform
designed and developed specifically to take advantage of the U2S data format; Aim 3: Convert the
retrospectively integrated National Sleep Research Resource polysomnography data collection to U2S
format and import the converted data to WaveSphere for interactive access and secondary analysis; Aim 4:
Evaluate and disseminate WaveSphere for continued enhancement and outreach. If successful, NAIRD will
achieve data interactability and usability at a level not seen before, enabling and supporting brain health
research by creating one of the largest and most comprehensive resource of FAIR, interactable, and AI-ready neurophysiological data. Areas impacted by NAIRD-enabled research include neurological diseases
and related conditions, through the application of machine learning algorithms for earlier predication,
prevention and improved care management."
11135638,"Abstract/Project Summary
Glucocorticoids are commonly prescribed as an essential drug regimen for anti-inflammatory modalities;
however, a major side effect of such therapies is the development of insulin resistance and risk for
hyperglycemia. Key contributors to insulin resistance induced by glucocorticoids are alterations in glucose and
lipid metabolism that negatively impact skeletal muscle. Glucocorticoids induce endogenous breakdown of lipid
from adipose tissue, releasing fatty acids into the circulation. Excess circulating lipids contribute to greater influx
into skeletal muscle, accrual of intramuscular lipids (e.g., ceramides, DAGs, TAGs, etc.), and induce a
pathological lipid burden on mitochondria. Excess intramuscular lipids also act as a competitive substrate to
carbohydrate metabolism and re-route glucose into hexosamine biosynthesis. The net result of these metabolic
changes ultimately impairs insulin signaling. While evidence supporting `lipotoxic' signaling molecules and
mitochondrial lipid overload leading to dysfunction are linked to insulin resistance, this concept has not been
investigated as part of the metabolic side effects of chronic glucocorticoid use. Our published and preliminary
data support the hypothesis that glucocorticoids promote insulin resistance by increasing the lipid burden within
skeletal muscle. To address this hypothesis, we propose the following strategies: In Specific Aim 1, we propose
to limit lipolysis-derived fatty acids from flooding into skeletal muscle using genetic models, which will provide
insights into glucocorticoid-mediated lipolytic events that influence insulin resistance. In complementary studies
proposed in Specific Aim 2, we will build on our novel preliminary data using skeletal muscle-targeted deletion
of Cpt1b (limiting mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation) to understand how restricting mitochondrial fatty acid
oxidation directly protects against glucocorticoid-induced metabolic dysfunction. Studies in Specific Aim 2 also
propose that excess cellular lipid uptake and hexosamine production act in a cooperative manner to potentiate
insulin resistance. We will use genetically modified mouse models to A) limit cellular lipid uptake in skeletal
muscle via deletion of the fatty acid transporter, Cd36, and B) limit hexosamine transfer to proteins in muscle
using deletion of O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT). Our novel data also supports the premise that elevated insulin
maintains lean mass and metabolic health in skeletal muscle. This will be tested using mice with skeletal muscle-
specific deletion of the insulin receptor. Finally, we propose the in vivo use of two novel, chemically synthesized
derivatives of hydrocortisone which function as glucocorticoid receptor agonists that retain anti-inflammatory
efficacy but are predicted to not induce adverse metabolic outcomes. These highly innovative studies, supported
by our preliminary data using both pharmacologic and genetic approaches, will provide unique mechanistic
evidence explaining one of the most deleterious side effects of chronic glucocorticoid usage and reveal insights
into strategies that can ideally be exploited to improve clinical outcomes of glucocorticoid therapy."

This application describes the research plan and program of study leading to a PhD as part of a combined MD-
PhD Program at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the Boys Town National Research Hospital. The
central goal of this research plan is to identify how dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone, and estradiol
modulate the development of cognitive systems serving selective attention and working memory processing.
Briefly, the pubertal transition period is marked by significant increases in these hormones and substantial
developmental advancements in higher-order cognitive functions, including working memory, selective attention,
and others. However, on the other hand, the incidence of psychiatric disease also increases during puberty, and
is accompanied by greater sex differences in disease prevalence. It has been suggested that this emergence of
psychiatric illness during puberty might be associated with the drastic hormonal changes that mark this
developmental stage, but the net impact of these hormonal changes on brain function and cognition is poorly
understood.
This F30 fellowship proposal will examine the sex and region-specific effects of DHEA, testosterone, and
estradiol on working memory and selective attention processing using an advanced dynamic functional mapping
approach based on magnetoencephalography (MEG), and includes a rigorous training and career development
plan for a future physician-scientist in the areas of pediatric psychiatry and developmental cognitive neuro-
science. The specific aims are (1) to examine the unique effects of pubertal hormones in predicting performance
on selective attention and working memory tasks and (2) to identify the relationship between sex steroid hormone
levels, neural oscillatory dynamics, and behavior during attention and working memory tasks. The trainee is a
minority MD/PhD student in his 2nd year of PhD study who has already distinguished himself through two first-
authored manuscripts in top journals, participation and presentation in scientific conferences, and a strong history
of academic achievement. In sum, this application for an F30 fellowship will use MEG, advanced source
reconstruction methods, neural oscillatory analyses, and hair-sampled hormone analysis to delineate the
relationship between pubertal hormone levels, brain dynamics, and cognitive development. The program of study
is designed to support this research plan through rigorous training by an internationally known expert in MEG
and dynamic brain mapping who has a strong record of mentoring trainees, as well as an expert collaborator in
pubertal hormone analysis and interpretation, with the primary goals of developing and expanding the research
and clinical skills of the applicant to produce a physician-scientist who is well equipped and prepared for the next
stage of his career."

11141398,"Functional neural circuits require accurate wiring by axons. Axonal targeting is mediated by a unique repertoire 
of guidance receptors differentially expressed on the axons of given neuronal populations. These receptors 
recognize spatially distributed guidance cues across an axon’s trajectory to guide directional axonal growth and 
ultimately the formation of appropriate synaptic connections. This complex cell to cell signaling is dynamic, 
spatially-regulated, and differs between neuronal populations and their targets. In a nervous system vulnerable 
to injury, regeneration of damaged motor axons back to their original muscle targets is essential for recovery of 
coordinated movement. Growing evidence demonstrates that axon regeneration is not simply a recapitulation of 
development, but that it requires unknown injury-dependent cues. Yet, what are the guidance receptors and cues 
that mediate topographically correct axon targeting and what is their spatial distribution? How does the cell 
signaling underlying circuit formation differ between developing and regenerating tissues? Understanding the 
cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate regenerative axon guidance represents an important 
and unaddressed goal that is relevant to recovery from injury or disease. To fill the existing knowledge gaps, I developed a unique model using the motor innervation of the larval 
zebrafish pectoral fin, which is homologous to tetrapod forelimbs. Importantly, this model allows for the in vivo 
observation of individual axons and their synaptic targets from development through regeneration. Monitoring 
distinct sub-populations of motor neurons reveals that they innervate topographically defined domains in the fin 
musculature. To find their targets, motor neuron axons must first navigate to the fin, sort between the abductor 
and adductor muscles, and grow to their appropriate muscle domain where they will form functional synapses. I 
have previously demonstrated that after laser-mediated axon transection, individual regenerating motor axons 
precisely return to their originally-specified muscle and target domains in the fin via unknown mechanisms. The 
long-term goal of my research program is to determine the molecular and cellular signaling that enables neuronal 
populations to re-establish such precise targeting. Given that each of the stepwise choice points along an axon’s 
route requires distinct guidance signaling mechanisms, a candidate-based approach to test the role of individual 
guidance cues is not efficient and will not provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex landscape 
through which an axon is guided. Thus, a critical foundation to support my research is the generation of a 
spatially-resolved single cell transcriptome of the motor neuron sub-populations as well as the cells of the fin that 
they target. The Center for Quantitative Biology (CQB) COBRE will advance my research career goals by 
providing me with the necessary scientific expertise, technical support, and dedicated mentorship to accomplish 
the following aims: 
Aim 1: Determine the molecular signature that defines distinct motor neuron populations. The pectoral 
fin is innervated by six different motor neuron populations that target distinct domains in the musculature. I 
hypothesize that each neuronal sub-population expresses a molecular signature that includes guidance 
receptors. Using 10x Chromium single cell RNA sequencing analysis, I will identify RNA transcripts that are 
unique to each neuronal population in order to develop transgenic tools to label them selectively. I will also 
identify candidate guidance receptors that may drive the unique topographic targeting of each neuronal 
population. 
Aim 2: Define the spatial organization of guidance cues across development and regeneration. The 
specific guidance cues and their spatial organization in the fin are unknown. Moreover, the pectoral fin is 
comprised of many cell types, including muscle, perineural glia, Schwann cells, vasculature, and endoskeletal 
cells, which could all contribute to the spatial organization of guidance cues that drive axon targeting. First, I will 
employ single cell sequencing on pectoral fins to establish the molecular signature of different cell types that 
comprise the fin. Then, I will use 10x Xenium spatial transcriptomics to visualize the anatomical location of RNA 
transcripts of specific guidance and growth cues at single cell resolution across development and regeneration 
of fin innervation. I will combine data from these approaches to resolve the identity of guidance cues, their spatial 
organization, and the cell types that express them to fuel hypothesis generation and mechanistic studies. 
The CQB COBRE cores and staff will directly support the technical and analytical execution of these 
aims. Both the 10x Chromium and Xenium analyzers that perform single cell transcriptomic profiling are housed 
in the Single Cell Genomics Core. In collaboration with the Genome Data Science Core, I will establish an 
analysis pipeline to integrate information about the neuronal guidance receptors expressed in neuronal subpopulations 
(Aim 1) with the guidance cues expressed specifically in the territory they innervate (Aim 2). Future 
work that will be competitive for NIH R01 or equivalent funding will leverage this rich dataset and the extensive 
toolkit in the genetically-tractable zebrafish to establish a functional role for the molecular drivers of correct axon 
targeting across development and regeneration. Insights gained from this work will have broader implications for 
deploying cell signaling mechanisms that build, maintain, and repair circuits across the nervous system."
11087444,"The Maternal and Pediatric Infectious Disease Branch (MPIDB) promotes research to investigate the impact and treatment of HIV, its complications, and other significant infectious diseases in infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant and nonpregnant women. This includes contracted clinical research activities conducted primarily in two major networks that actively collect specimens to be housed in the NICHD repository. These are the Pediatric HIV AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS) and the International Maternal Pediatric and Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials (IMPAACT) network. 

PHACS is a multicenter United States-based program that follows both perinatally HIV-infected youth and HIV-exposed/uninfected infants, children, and youth. PHACS currently includes four main protocols and four sub studies. A wide variety of specimen types are collected at 18 SMARTT (Surveillance Monitoring for ART Toxicities Study in HIV-uninfected Children Born to HIV-infected Women) and 14 AMP (Adolescent Master Protocol) current study sites that require repository services.

The IMPAACT Network is focused on evaluating potential therapies for HIV infection and its related symptoms in infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women, including clinical trials of HIV/AIDS interventions for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. The research agenda includes studies on the pharmacokinetics, safety, optimal dosing, and long-term complications of new antiretroviral (ARV) therapies for HIV/AIDS in pediatric and adolescent populations and in pregnant women. NICHD-funded sites (via the NICHD International and Domestic Pediatric and Maternal HIV Studies and Other Infectious Diseases Data Coordinating Center contract) utilize the NICHD repository; NIAID-funded sites utilize a separate NIAID-supported repository. NICHD-supported sites also perform other trials independently or within other networks. 
The IMPAACT network collects samples in specific protocols at 14 U.S. and 9 international NICHD clinical research sites. A wide variety of specimen types are collected and require repository services. 
The Data and Operations Center for both PHACS and IMPAACT is at the Harvard School of Public Health with data management services provided by Frontier Science Technology Research Foundation (FSTRF). Both PHACS and IMPAACT use the Frontier Science LDMS laboratory information management system to manage their sample collections.

The IMPAACT Network collaborates with the NICHD Domestic & International Pediatric & Maternal HIV & Other High-Priority Infectious Diseases Clinical Studies Network, the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions, and with other NICHD-, NIH-, and organization-led HIV/AIDS research networks and projects."
11042098,"BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION
The mission of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is to lead research and training to understand human development, improve reproductive health, enhance the lives of children and adolescents, and optimize abilities for all.

The Maternal and Pediatric Infectious Disease Branch (MPIDB) supports one of the major missions of the NICHD to enhance maternal, pediatric, and adolescent health and development.
The objective or mission of this initiative is to provide support for critical infrastructure to enhance maternal, pediatric, and adolescent HIV therapeutics and prevention, including HIV vaccine research activities on a global scale. To provide opportunities to participate in therapeutic research, clinical trial centers must be situated in areas where infected women and children are located. Domestically, the vast majority of infected women and children are of minority race and ethnicity and often live in urban, inner-city areas in which the medical care system is often overwhelmed and under-funded. Internationally, continuing research in resource-limited countries is critical to address the global problem of pediatric HIV infection.
The funding and conduct of clinical research in such settings offers many challenges though and requires a system that is flexible and responsive, and that ideally provides coordinated care of the mother and child together in a family-centered setting to optimize the maintenance of both woman and child in ongoing health care.

SCOPE
This Task Order will provide on an as needed basis the continuous and recurring logistical, technical, and administrative support needed for the implementation, maintenance, coordination,
and management of a multi-site network of domestic and international clinical centers to conduct clinical trials for the evaluation of investigational therapies, diagnostic techniques, prevention strategies, epidemiology, and natural history of multiple aspects of HIV infection in pediatric, adolescent, and maternal patient populations."

Climate change is the largest global health challenge of the 21st century. Although direct and indirect effects of
climate change threaten health worldwide, the impacts will be particularly severe in low and middle-income
countries (LMICs). There is an alarming absence of research on climate-driven exposures and human health in
LMICs, and how to adapt and build resilience to these climate hazards. We will address these research gaps
by leveraging the infrastructure and ongoing data collection in the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology
(PURE) study, a prospective cohort of 200,000 adults across 998 urban/rural communities in 27 low, middle,
and high-income countries. We will leverage this existing data and infrastructure to establish PURE-Climate, a
global study of climate change and human health. Aim 1 will determine the direct impacts of acute climate-
driven exposures (e.g. extreme temperatures, floods, storms) on diverse health outcomes (e.g.
hospitalizations, CVD incidence, mortality) and determine vulnerability and resilience factors. We will quantify
associations between acute climate-driven hazards and diverse health outcomes using a case-crossover
design and over a decade of prospective data collected for PURE individuals. Acute hazards will be assessed
using state-of-the-art geospatial methods for each PURE community. Aim 2 will evaluate the indirect impacts of
chronic climate-driven exposures on mortality and NCDs, determine pathways of influence, and assess
vulnerability and resilience factors. We will apply long-term meteorological data and global climate re-analysis
datasets to examine the indirect impacts of climate exposures on mortality and NCD incidence using
prospective data collected in PURE. To further understand indirect pathways, adaptation, and vulnerably and
resilience factors we will implement a climate-health survey to individuals living in PURE communities
experiencing diverse climate-driven changes. Aim 3 will identify community-level opportunities and barriers for
increasing climate resilience by conducting focus groups with 12 PURE communities and develop a Building
Resilience Against Climate-Disaster Effects (BRADE) framework for low-resource settings. The PURE-Climate
grant will provide quantitative and qualitative information on how climate change influences human health,
especially in LMICs, and demonstrate how these impacts can be reduced through adaptation and local climate
resilience. Finally, the PURE-Climate study will build capacity for future climate change and health research
within LMICs."

The calvaria (upper part of the skull) comprises plates of bone and fibrous joints (sutures and fontanels).
While the bone protects the brain, the sutures contain stem cells for osteoblasts, and thus allow the skull to
grow coordinately with the expanding brain of a child. Craniosynostosis (a premature loss of the suture(s)) is
a major class of human birth defects. It can lead to dysmorphic skull, and further affect brain and orofacial
development. Current treatment for craniosynostosis often involves invasive and repetitive surgeries at young
ages with relatively high rates of complications. Therefore, improving the methods of intervention for this
defect is of great importance to public health.
 The calvaria is made of cells from the neural crest and the mesoderm in embryos. In mice, these cells
form a mesenchyme layer that completely encases the brain soon after mid-gestation (cranial mesenchyme).
The cranial mesenchyme on the apical side of the head (a.k.a. early migrating mesenchyme, EMM) gives rise
to soft tissues such as the sutures, the dermis/hypodermis of the scalp, and the meninges.
 Our previous study has shown that LMX1B (LIM homeobox transcription factor 1b) plays a key role in
suppressing osteogenesis in EMM to allow suture formation. Recently, single cell sequencing and in silico
analyses from our group and others have suggested that EMM contains two populations of intermediate
progenitors: suturodermal progenitors (SDP) with a dual potential for the suture mesenchyme and the
dermis/hypodermis, and common meningeal progenitors (CMP), which contribute to the dura and the
arachnoid layers of the meninges. We found that both SDP and CMP populations were severely decreased in
Lmx1b mutants, whereas cells with a restricted fate were increased and appeared precociously. The goal of
this project is to identify factors underpinning cell fate specification and differentiation in the cranial
mesenchyme, and to utilize this information to generate SDP in vitro from human embryonic stem cells
(hESC). In Aim1. we will determine transcription factors and signaling pathways that regulate cell fate
specification and differentiation in the cranial mesenchyme in vivo. In Aim2, we will determine genetic
regulators that control SDP specification and differentiation in vitro from hESC. The completion of this project
will fill the critical gap in the current knowledge of suturogenesis. Furthermore, our results can facilitate efforts
to use suture stem cells for craniosynostosis treatment, a promising new direction of research in the field."
11141315,"Project Summary
Outdoor fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5, particles with aerodynamic diameter < 2.5 𝜇m) is a leading cause
of global morbidity and mortality, contributing to millions of premature deaths each year. Climate change will
worsen the burden of disease from PM2.5 in the coming decades, with severe effects felt by those of low
socioeconomic status and from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. Little is known about the extent to
which different US populations may experience “different kinds of particles” with respect to PM2.5 composition
and overall toxicity. Recent research suggests that the combined transition metal and sulfur content of PM2.5
may influence the respiratory and cardiovascular health risks that result from acute and chronic exposure.
Oxidative stress is an important mechanism linked to the cardiorespiratory health effects of PM2.5 and several
recent studies have incorporated measures of PM2.5 oxidative potential (a measure of the ability of particles to
promote oxidative stress in cells and tissues) as a complementary metric to PM2.5 mass. Importantly, several of
these studies have noted stronger associations between outdoor PM2.5 mass concentrations and both acute
and chronic health outcomes when the PM2.5 oxidative potential was elevated. We hypothesize that particle
acidity increases the bioavailability of PM metals, allowing them to participate in redox reactions that contribute
to oxidative stress and potential adverse cardiovascular and respiratory health outcomes.
The objective of this research is to determine how spatial and temporal variations in PM2.5 composition and
oxidative potential may modify the strength of associations between PM2.5 mass concentrations and
cardiorespiratory morbidity/mortality. We will deploy a low-cost measurement network to quantify PM2.5
oxidative potential on a national scale. Collected samples will be analyzed for trace elements and oxidative
potential (Aim 1). With these data we will conduct a national-scale time-stratified case-crossover study of daily
variations in outdoor PM2.5 mass concentrations and acute cardiorespiratory morbidity among Medicare
enrollees (Aim 2). Specifically, this analysis will evaluate how monthly variations in PM2.5 components and
oxidative potential across the US modify the strength of associations between day-to-day changes PM2.5 mass
concentrations and acute health outcomes (acute myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, congestive
heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma) among potentially sensitive subsets of the
US population. Finally, we will conduct a cohort study in the Medicare cohort (Aim 3) to evaluate how spatial
variations in annual average estimates of PM2.5 components and oxidative potential across the US modify the
strength of associations between yearly changes PM2.5 mass concentrations and chronic health outcomes
among potentially sensitive subsets of the US population. We will also estimate the shapes of concentration-
response relationships within strata defined by different PM2.5 composition and oxidative potential."
11141316,"Exposure to fluoride is ubiquitous in many developed countries including the United States and Mexico due to
fluoridation of water and salt, respectively. Several studies from Canada and Mexico suggest that exposure to
fluoride (as measured in urine) prenatally or early in childhood could result in impaired neurodevelopment. This
notion is supported by our preliminary data suggesting increases in fluoride are associated with internalizing
symptoms at age 12 years. To date, there have been no studies capable of assessing critical windows of
fluoride exposure starting in utero and continuing through early childhood. We hypothesize that exposure to
fluoride during critical windows occurring prenatally and in early childhood impacts cognition,
neurobehavior, and brain structure in adolescence. We will leverage existing resources from two well-
characterized ongoing longitudinal birth cohorts: the Cincinnati Combined Childhood Cohorts (C4) study
(Discovery Cohort) and the Programming Research in Obesity, Growth, Environment and Social Stressors
(PROGRESS) cohort (Replication Cohort). We will utilize weekly temporal tooth fluoride exposure and
neurobehavioral data to examine associations between the timing and intensity of fluoride exposure with IQ,
externalizing (i.e., hyperactivity, aggression) and internalizing behaviors (i.e., anxiety, depression) assessed in
childhood (7-8 years) and adolescence (12 years). Given that very little is known about the mechanistic
processes by which fluoride impacts neurobehavior and cognition, we also propose to leverage structural
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data collected at 12 years to assess whole brain, cortical and subcortical
structural volumes. This will allow us to identify developmental periods during which fluoride exposure is
associated with total and regional changes in white and gray matter brain volumes. The study design, based
on two well-established birth cohorts with over 12 years of follow-up, will allow for the first-time longitudinal
investigations of the impact of fluoride on neurodevelopment and brain structure. The scientific knowledge to
be gained has the potential to establish new paradigms in fluoride neurotoxicity and improve public health by
providing evidence-based research to inform regulatory and preventative interventions targeted to reduce
fluoride exposure if warranted."
11141321,"ABSTRACT
The adult prevalence of Electronic cigarettes (Ecigs) is ~5%, with young adults having the highest prevalence,
and 56% of the young adults were never smokers, which includes women of reproductive age. The novelty and
customizability of Ecigs, combined with messaging the Ecigs are ‘safer’ than cigarettes, drives much of the
appeal and interest for youth in using Ecigs. Yet, a growing number of studies are showing that Ecig usage has
negative vascular actions and that these outcomes are not different than smoking traditional cigarettes. Another
area of significant concern relates to maternal vaping during pregnancy. Female smokers are more inclined to
experiment with Ecigs compared to males with 5-16% of women using Ecigs during pregnancy. However,
emerging pre-clinical data shows that perinatal exposure from vaping dams results in adverse health outcomes
in progeny. We have shown that Ecig exposure during this “sensitive” developmental window induces a lasting
impact (into adult life) on the vascular health of offspring. Previous studies have shown that environmental
exposures in animal models and humans adversely affect cognitive function. This has led the NIH to prioritize
studies that examine the basic mechanisms of Ecigs on health outcomes. This proposal leverages our prior work,
which establishes a robust and reliable pre-clinical phenotype, to better understand the dose and potential
molecular mechanisms underpinning vascular dysfunction with direct and in utero Ecig exposures. Xanthine
oxidoreductase (XOR) is a significant source of oxidants (hydrogen peroxide, superoxide) that are implicated in
the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. We have evidence to support that XOR is a key mediator of this vascular
dysfunction with both direct Ecig exposure (F0) and in utero Ecig exposure (the F1 offspring). Our central
hypothesis is that (direct and/or and in-utero) Ecig exposure elevates hepatic XOR, which is released into the
circulation causing cerebrovascular and aortic dysfunction via the direct actions of XOR-oxidants on the
endothelium. As such, Ecig exposure accelerates vascular-associated diseases and cognitive decline (i.e.,
VCID). We have a unique exposure system that measures real-time (puff-by-puff) Ecig dose exposure in a
controlled environment, allowing us to examine high-fidelity dose-related exposure-induced effects on our animal
models. Aim 1a will establish a dose-related Ecig exposure in the development of Ecig-mediated vascular
dysfunction and XOR activity. In Aim 1b, we use our liver (hepatocyte)-and endothelial-specific XOR conditional
KO mouse to manipulate the XOR pathway during direct Ecig exposure (F0 generation) and to examine vascular
and cognitive function. In Aim 2, we will determine the long-term vascular, neurobiological, and behavioral
consequences and role of XOR with in-utero (F1 generation) Ecig exposures. Complementary experiments will
also examine the interaction of VCID, by manipulating the XOR pathway (using febuxostat) and determining if
we can delay the pathological progression of VCID. The studies will fill gaps identified by the NIH regarding the
need for understanding the basic mechanisms of Ecigs on health outcomes."
11141322,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Numerous environmental and cellular factors can induce DNA lesions or create other types of challenges that
can slow DNA replication, leading to replication stress. Failure to alleviate this stress and restart stalled
replication forks can cause genome instability, which can drive cancer initiation and progression and affect the
cellular response to chemotherapy. Hence, deciphering the cellular response to replication stress––the long-
term goal of this application––is imperative for understanding fundamental aspects of tumorigenesis. One
crucial aspect of the replication stress response involves replication fork reversal, a process that leads to the
formation of a four-way junction structure by the remodeling of both nascent and parental DNA strands. There
are a family of ATP-dependent translocases that promote fork reversal in vitro and in cells, but why so many
enzymes are involved in this process is not understood. We showed that one of these translocases, HLTF,
prevents a stress-resistant mode of replication by promoting fork reversal, and we elucidated the basic
mechanism by which cells continue replication upon HLTF loss. The object of this application is to further
elucidate the mechanisms by which HLTF mediates the replication stress response, characterizing its unique
role in this process. HLTF is a multi-functional protein and recent studies using a panel of HLTF mutants that
are each deficient for one of its activities have revealed unexpected roles for these activities in HLTF’s known
functions, raising a number of new and exciting questions. This application will address questions about the
molecular mechanisms by which HLTF promotes fork slowing and fork reversal in cells and determine the
impact of its loss on replisome stability, genome stability, cell proliferation. Aim 1 will investigate which
domains of HLTF are needed for fork slowing, fork reversal, and resistance to replication stress, and HLTF’s
association with the replication fork. HLTF’s dynamic interaction with the fork will also be probed. Aim 2 will
investigate a newly discovered function for HLTF in stabilizing the replication fork. These experiments will
employ a combination of molecular, cellular, genetic and proteomic approaches as well as single-molecule
imaging and tracking methods in Xenopus extracts to solve fundamental questions about how cells respond to
replication stress."

The vision of the Rocky Mountain Center for Occupational and Environmental Health (RMCOEH) is to be the
leading center in the world in meeting current and future occupational and environmental health and safety
challenges, thereby protecting workers and their environments. RMCOEH will achieve this through
interdisciplinary education, research, and service, as stated in its mission.
RMCOEH has six established programs that have produced 761 graduates and will continue to support the
center’s goals (Ergonomics & Safety, Industrial Hygiene, Occupational Medicine Residency, Occupational
Injury Prevention Research Training, Targeted Research Training, and Pilot Projects Research Training). The
center’s Continuing Education program, meanwhile, has trained more than 15,000 workers in the preceding
five years and impacts more than 3,000 businesses annually, and our Outreach program touches hundreds of
thousands of people. RMCOEH intends to advance the training and impact of each of these programs,
producing a diverse group of graduates and trainees that is equipped to meet the interdisciplinary needs of
Health and Human Services Region 8 and to carry out the center’s vision and mission.
Further, RMCOEH is proposing the addition of a new graduate certificate program for which there is major
demand in Region 8: Occupational Health Nursing. This program will elevate RMCOEH’s impact to even
greater heights and serve as a pipeline for employers that are in desperate need of occupational health nurses,
ultimately ensuring workers are safer and receive better care in the event of an injury or illness.
RMCOEH’s research efforts currently include 44+ current extramural projects with $30.8M in funding. These
are crucial to the center’s success in the coming grant period. They will continue to bolster the center’s mission
and contribute to the knowledge base of occupational and environmental health and safety issues. An example
of RMCOEH’s ability to perform research that has immediate, real-world impact is its leadership role in
groundbreaking COVID-19 vaccine efficacy studies that provided key information for the pandemic response.
The center’s existing programs, the addition of an Occupational Health Nursing graduate certificate program,
and a continuing focus on research will allow RMCOEH to continue serving a vital role in occupational and
environmental health and safety in Region 8. We are eager to advance our efforts in the coming five years and
aim to make an even larger impact on the lives of workers and their environment."
11141272,"TITLE: Investigating Interferon Antagonists in Delaying Innate Immune Responses to SARS-CoV-2
PI: Susan C. Baker, PhD, Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine
The goal of this proposal is to determine how viral interferon antagonists function in the replication and
pathogenesis of coronaviruses, particularly during replication of Severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a diverse family of positive-sense RNA viruses that
include pathogenic strains infecting human and animal hosts. CoVs have repeatedly jumped from animal
reservoirs into human circulation, causing severe disease and pandemics, as we are currently experiencing
with SARS-CoV-2. Developing appropriate protective measures against emerging CoVs, including SARS-CoV-
2, will depend upon gaining an understanding of coronavirus-host interactions. We discovered that the
endoribonuclease (EndoU), a highly conserved component of the CoV replicase complex, reduces dsRNA
species recognized by host pattern recognition receptor MDA5, delaying the induction of interferon. We
reported that viruses expressing an inactive form of EndoU replicate as efficiently as wild type virus in IFN non-
responsive cells. Importantly, replication of EndoU mutant CoVs in interferon-responsive cells activate robust
immune responses, which extinguishes virus replication and reduces pathogenesis in animals. Recently, we
identified the target of EndoU activity to be poly-uridine containing negative sense RNA, which we term PUN
RNA. This removal of the PUN RNA delays the generation of dsRNA species that are recognized by host
pattern recognition receptor MDA5. We hypothesize that EndoU activity contributes to the delay in the
innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2 replication. Here, we propose to investigate the mechanism of
how EndoU acts in SARS-CoV-2, how EndoU associates with the replicase complex, and how PUN RNA
contributes to activating MDA5. In Aim 1, we will evaluate EndoU and other IFN antagonists for their role as
modulators of Type I and Type III IFN responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection in primary human airway cells and
in enterocytes. We will use reverse genetics to generate viruses with inactive IFN antagonists and evaluate the
effects of combining inactivation of EndoU with inactivating mutations of other viral protein IFN antagonists. In
Aim 2 we will delineate and disrupt EndoU interactions within the coronavirus replicase complex. The results of
these studies will guide strategies for disruption of EndoU from the CoV replicase complex, which would
activate protective immune responses to CoV infections. In Aim 3, we will identify regions of poly-uridine
negative-sense RNA, termed PUN RNA, required for recognition by EndoU and MDA5. These studies will
provide new information on how PUN RNAs are recognized by EndoU and MDA5. Overall, these studies will
define a new mechanism for how an endoribonuclease acts as a virulence factor. This new information can be
used to develop antiviral therapies and vaccines against existing and emerging coronaviruses."

11135662,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The global spread of the arthropod borne flaviviruses dengue (DENV1-4) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses are major
global public health challenges. World health organizations are calling for scientific communities to respond to
this emerging threat with vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics. However, existing gaps in fundamental
knowledge about DENV and ZIKV immunity, specifically how type-specific immunity to each serotype develops
and is sustained, makes rational vaccine development particularly difficult. The dominant immunity model comes
from human challenge studies on DENV (1910’s-1940’s) and posits that first infection induces neutralizing
antibodies that provide life-long sterilizing immunity to repeat infections by the same (homotypic) serotype virus,
and this model has been extended to ZIKV without rigorous evaluation. However, recent studies from DENV
endemic regions provide evidence of homotypic re-infection and natural immune boosting over time and our
preliminary data from a non-endemic, Portland, Oregon resident DENV and ZIKV immune cohort show type-
specific Abs decay – lose both potency and breadth - over time, calling into question sterilizing immunity and
leading us to hypothesize that natural flavivirus (ZIKV and DENV) protective immunity is context dependent: in
endemic transmission settings intermittent asymptomatic boosting maintains potency and breadth of virus
specific immunity and in non-endemic or very low transmission settings potency and breadth of flavivirus
immunity significantly wanes. To test this hypothesis, we propose to prospectively characterize and compare
DENV and ZIKV immunity in a regularly re-exposed endemic cohort in Ponce, Puerto Rico with immunity in an
un-boosted, non-endemic cohort of DENV immunes in Portland. This is a controversial and novel hypothesis
that will call for substantial supporting evidence, hence we will compare and contrast three highly relevant and
related markers of boosting between the two cohorts: The potency and breadth of neutralizing serum DENV and
ZIKV specific Abs (Aim 1), the frequency of and potency of DENV and ZIKV non-structural protein 1 (NS1)
specific antibodies (Aim 2), and the frequency and specificity of DENV and ZIKV specific memory B-cells (MBCs)
(Aim 3). We expect to find that Abs and MBCs decline at a significantly greater rate in individuals from the non-
endemic setting compared to the endemic setting supporting the hypothesis that boosting plays a critical role in
natural immunity for these viruses, with implications for future vaccine development. Because MBCs are
functionally linked to Abs, quantifying virus specific MBCs tests a mechanistic connection between repeat
infection and Ab titer boosting. Our proposed work will comprehensively assess the role transmission context
plays in flavivirus immunity using two highly relevant and mechanistically linked determinants (Ab and MBC).
Irrespective of specific results, the knowledge obtained from the proposed work will be essential to DENV vaccine
development and mechanistic understanding of flavivirus Ab mediated immunity."
11137295,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ongoing cancer genomic studies have documented numerous mutations across all tumor types. Most cancer
mutations have not been functionally characterized, as conducting experiments with individual cell line models
for each mutation is neither scalable nor practical. Moreover, primary tumors and cancer cell lines exhibit
extensive genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity, with multiple subclones coexisting within the same cancer
population. Each subclone possesses different biological properties. Therefore, it is crucial to closely monitor
this heterogeneity to achieve clear and reproducible results.
There is a lack of integrated experimental systems and computational approaches capable of analyzing the
genomic complexity of subclonal populations. To address this need, we will integrate two distinct approaches—
one genomic and one bioinformatic—to engineer, track, and study the impact of various mutations on the
subclonal properties of cancer, including growth. Transcript-informed single-cell CRISPR sequencing (TISCC-
seq), developed by the Ji group at Stanford, can experimentally model cancer mutations of interest at single-cell
resolution by leveraging CRISPR engineering and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). CLONEID,
developed by the Andor group at Moffitt Cancer Center, is a computational tool for monitoring heterogeneous
cell populations by taking daily microscopic cell images and incorporating various assays, including single-cell
sequencing. Using this integrated system, we will characterize the functional consequences of mutations in
clinically relevant genes (TP53, PTEN, and MET) in gastric cancers by monitoring and modeling subclonal
dynamics over time.
The objective of this project is to develop an integrated system combining TISCC-seq for single-cell mutation
analysis with the CLONEID framework to evaluate the functional consequences of introduced mutations by
monitoring and modeling subclonal dynamics. We have two specific aims: 1) adapting the CLONEID framework
for TISCC-seq single cell clonal tracking and readouts and 2) Single cell longitudinal monitoring of TISCC-seq
engineered clonal growth phenotypes. This project aims to demonstrate how an integrated system can provide
accurate and reproducible insights into the functional consequences of known cancer mutations."
11141274,"Project Summary:
Breastfeeding has been shown to protect mothers and their children from metabolic disease later in life. However,
maternal obesity and diabetes independently predict poor lactation outcomes, even after adjustments for
breastfeeding support and socioeconomic factors. The physiological reasons for this relationship remain unclear.
This proposal aims to identify the molecular mechanisms linking lactation to metabolism with a long-term goal of
developing interventions to improve lactation outcomes in women with obesity and/or diabetes.
Investigations of human lactation are challenging due to ethical and practical barriers related to accessing
mammary tissue in the lactating state. Single cell RNA sequencing of human milk-derived cells has shown that
these cells are remarkably similar to mammary epithelial cells (MECs) resident in the lactating gland. Additional
cell sorting efforts have established milk-derived MECs as “liquid breast biopsies” which may be used to answer
many outstanding questions regarding lactation biology.
Furthermore, a delicate balance of insulin signaling is required for MEC differentiation and maintenance.
Mammary specific knockout of the insulin receptor (mam-IRKO) blocks MEC secretory differentiation, and
therefore impedes lactation. Conversely, mammary-specific expression of an active form of insulin’s downstream
mediator, AKT, also drives lactation failure. In order to identify appropriate interventional approaches to improve
lactation performance, it is critical to understand if MECs are responsive or resistant to insulin in the context of
hyperinsulinemia. Studies of non-lactating mammary glands in women with obesity and diet-induced obese mice
suggest that premature insulin signaling may be responsible for these effects, by driving dysregulated glandular
development. The aims of this project are to 1. establish the effect of maternal gestational diabetes (GDM) on
MEC progenitor insulin signaling and milk-derived MEC profiles and 2. define the effects of insulin and other
metabolic hormones on MEC secretory differentiation and function.
Milk-derived MECs of women with and without severe GDM, matching for BMI, will be utilized to determine if
MEC progenitors from women with GDM are sufficiently responsive or resistant to insulin, and differences
between MEC populations which may explain impaired lactation outcomes in these women will be assessed. In
vivo and in vitro models of MEC development will be used to identify the mechanism underlying insulin’s effect
on lactogenic prolactin signaling, which is downregulated in mam-IRKO mice. Effects of adipokines leptin and
adiponectin on MEC development and function will also be investigated.
This proposal will inform future efforts to investigate additional links between obesity and/or diabetes and human
lactation dysfunction. The proposed approach has the potential to break a vicious intergenerational cycle of
metabolic disease. A collaborative team of experts in mammary physiology and diabetes in pregnancy will
support the applicant to ensure success of this innovative project."

The TL1 program addresses the NCATS unmet need of a prepared translational research workforce. Since the
first cohort was recruited in 2016, the TL1 program has transformed training in translational research at UMMS
from a fragmented, siloed training model to a collaborative training environment, well integrated with UMCCTS
resources. The TL1 program provides didactic training to develop domain expertise, rigorous research, team
science, and communication skills. The TL1 specific aims are to: 1) Assure core competence in clinical and
translational research for highly qualified pre- and early post-doctoral trainees through the provision of a multi-
faceted, rigorous TL1 program; 2) Facilitate a broad spectrum of clinical and translational research responsive
to unmet health needs; 3) Enable efficiency, quality, effectiveness, and reproducibility in the development of
new products or approaches; and 4) Foster transdisciplinary training and team science in research. To achieve
these aims, we have developed 5 structured Research Pathways in Entrepreneurship and Commercialization,
Data Science, Community Engagement, Implementation Science, and a Generalist Pathway. To assure a di-
verse trainee population with respect to clinical background, disciplinary perspective, and those underrepre-
sented in the biomedical sciences, we recruit from national and local pools of eligible candidates. TL1 trainees
self-assess their competency in clinical and translational research as defined by the national CTSA Consortium
and work with mentoring teams to create an individualized competency-based curriculum providing formal and
informal opportunities to develop research skills. Locally, our Council to Advance Trainees and Scholars leads
efforts to reduce redundancy and to integrate translational learning opportunities across the training ecosystem
at UMMS. Regionally and nationally, our trainees learn to use CTSA tools (e.g., i2b2) and engage with CTSA
collaborators (e.g., shared mentoring, research rotations, retreats). In the next funding period, our TL1 Pro-

 The University of Kentucky (UK) Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS) proposes to sustain
and enhance the current pre-doctoral and post-doctoral TL1 program, currently in its ninth year of National
Institutes of Health (NIH) support. By providing a multidisciplinary training program that integrates trainees
across diverse fields and offers rigorous and solid translational research education, the TL1 program has
effectively prepared clinicians- and scientists-in-training for careers as leaders in clinical and translational
science. The UK TL1 program features substantial collaborations across a robust cohort of productive
investigators, a talented pool of qualified applicants, solid infrastructure and strong institutional support. The
program takes advantage of the physical juxtaposition of UK’s six health care colleges (Medicine, Nursing,
Pharmacy, Public Health, Health Sciences, Dentistry) and key disciplines on the main campus (e.g.
Engineering, Social Work, Biology, Psychology, Education) to train scholars across wide-ranging fields
necessary for successful clinical and translational research (CTR). The program supports career development
of scholars with research interests that cross the lifespan (prenatal through elderly) and the full spectrum of
clinical and translational science, including translational, clinical, community/policy studies and CTR
methods/processes (e.g., biomedical informatics) focusing on a broad array of health topics. The TL1 trainees
are making important contributions to science through published work, and all of the program graduates are
actively engaged in CTR. This program and other CCTS-sponsored efforts are engaging underserved students
in projects focused on health disparities of Kentucky and the Central Appalachian area. We are requesting
renewed NIH support for eight TL1 scholars. The foundation of the proposed program will continue to be
practical research experiences within multidisciplinary teams guided by experienced mentors along with
educational and training offerings, such as certificate, Master’s and PhD degrees, to ensure successful career
development of these future CTR leaders. Scholar competency assessments, based on the Clinical Research
Appraisal Inventory, serve to guide new program offerings with the theory that trainees who have high
confidence in their skills are more likely to pursue a career in CTR. UK CCTS-developed pipeline programs
targeting professional and graduate students, including new initiatives to support health equities researchers
and trainees from under-represented groups, will ensure the availability of a strong pool of candidates for the
TL1 program. In sum, the TL1 program is designed to accelerate career development of future leaders in the
translational science workforce who will be prepared to address today’s complex research challenges and
spearhead advances in human health.

Consortium for the Study of Pancreatitis: Pittsburgh Clinical Center.
The Consortium for the Study of Pancreatitis: Pittsburgh Clinical Center (PCC) is a multidisciplinary clinical-
translational program at the University of Pittsburgh and UPMC. The PCC is one of the 10 founding members
of the Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC). The
organizational structure of PCC allows comprehensive epidemiological, clinical and biological characterization
of patients with pancreatic disorders in order to conduct clinical, translational and mechanistic studies of
recurrent acute pancreatitis (RAP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP) and their sequelae such as Type 3c diabetes
and pancreatic cancer. The PCC is highly integrated at all levels of the CPDPC, including leadership,
participation in Committees and Working Groups, contribution to primary cohorts, several ancillary studies and
publications. PCC has been effective in utilizing the CPDPC infrastructure and resources for high-quality
scientific projects. In the next five years of funding, the PCC is committed to completing ascertainment of the
primary CPDPC cohorts, execution of the currently approved ancillary studies, and participating in new
projects. We will also propose concepts for three new ancillary studies that will utilize the infrastructure and
resources of the CPDPC. Our specific aims are: Aim 1. Contribute to completing the acquisition of CPDPC’s
primary cohorts and ongoing ancillary studies. Aim 2. We will propose and support new ancillary projects to
use the infrastructure created with the primary cohorts and ongoing ancillary studies. As part of Aim 2, we
propose concepts for three ancillary projects, to – i) Develop a Chronic Pancreatitis Risk Score (CPRS) for use
in randomized clinical trials of CP, ii) Identify Urine Biomarkers of Pain (UBP) for mechanism-based
phenotyping of CP pain, and iii) Use a genotying approach to enrich the New Onset Diabetes (NOD) cohort.
Our existing and well-established, efficient and effective clinical and research infrastructure for patient accrual,
sample processing, data management and transfer, and analysis will support the program. The rich clinical
volume, diverse investigator expertise in all critical areas such as pancreatology, epidemiology, early detection
of cancer, genetics, physiology, imaging, endocrinology, biostatistics and bioinformatics, and all relevant
disease subtypes, administrative authority in clinical and research areas ensure continued success. Our track
record of leadership, strong collaborations and working relationships within the CPDPC and other collaborative
networks will also ensure continued success and effectiveness of the CPDPC."

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) disproportionately impacts Latino children, families and communities. T2D disparities
are the result of complex interactions that involve biological susceptibility and various interdependent social
determinants that represent the root causes of disease. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) established that
T2D can be prevented in high-risk adults through intensive lifestyle intervention. Although the DPP has been
translated to a variety of adult populations and settings, engagement and effectiveness is diminished in minority
communities and there are no family-focused diabetes prevention trials for Latinos. For over a decade, our team
has collaborated to address the social and cultural determinants of diabetes among Latino youth, in the midst of
extant disparities in access to care, low health literacy, and certain cultural norms that may increase diabetes
risk. Our culturally-grounded approach is guided by an Ecodevelopmental model that considers community,
family, peer, and individual-level factors that influence health behaviors and health outcomes over time. Through
a series of increasingly rigorous studies we established that a lifestyle intervention can significantly reduce T2D
risk factors and increase Quality of Life (QoL) among Latino adolescents with obesity. We now propose to build
upon our extensive experience working with the local Latino community to rigorously test the efficacy of a
family-focused diabetes prevention intervention for reducing T2D risk and increasing QoL among high-risk
Latino families. We will use Integrative Mixed Methods to understand how family structures and processes
influence intervention outcomes. We will examine the sustainability of the intervention at 12-months and explore
mediators and moderators of long-term changes. Lastly, we acknowledge that the current translational gap
between scientific discovery and real-world impact must be closed so that evidence-based interventions are
expeditiously scaled to advance towards health equity for vulnerable and underserved populations. Therefore,
we will use the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework to guide areas for
adaptation and integration within key community-based organizations that may be well-positioned to adopt and
implement family-focused diabetes prevention programs. Our long-term goal is to build the evidence, network,
and capacity to scale multi-level, family-focused diabetes prevention programs across systems that serve
vulnerable and disadvantaged communities. As the next step towards this goal, we propose the following
Primary Aim: Test the efficacy of a 4-month, family-focused diabetes prevention intervention, compared to a
family control condition, for improving glucose tolerance and increasing QoL among high-risk Latino families.
Secondary Aim: Understand how family structure and family processes influence the reach, diffusion, and
impact of the intervention on the family system. Exploratory Aim: Examine mediators and moderators of 12-
month changes in glucose tolerance and QoL. Implementation Aim: Create a statewide, stakeholder-
informed plan to take family diabetes prevention to scale by 1) generating a rapid learning community with
organizations that serve Latino families in Arizona, 2) exploring the need, readiness, costs of, and capacity for
implementation across these organizations, and 3) planning adaptations and activities to enhance fit and
function of the intervention within these organizations."

The U.S. faces profound racial and ethnic disparities in hypertension, which are exacerbated by disparities in
medication adherence. Yet few existing medication adherence interventions are tailored to address the specific
cultural beliefs of diverse populations who also face significant structural barriers to adherence associated with
poverty, access to care and food insecurity. The proposed Improving Medication Adherence with Pharmacist
and CHW Team (IMPaCT) intervention responds to the call for adherence interventions that are tailored for the
specific needs of minority racial-ethnic groups. IMPaCT is a practice-based randomized controlled trial (RCT)
to test the effectiveness of a comprehensive, individually- and culturally-tailored intervention for high-risk
patients with hypertension, polypharmacy and low adherence. IMPaCT leverages the specialized expertise of a
clinical pharmacist together with a community health worker (CHW) who will serve as cultural broker and
patient navigator to address individual, clinical, social-cultural, and structural barriers to adherence. This
comprehensive and tailored, coordinated care intervention aims to improve medication adherence and
hypertension outcomes among African-American, Latino and Vietnamese immigrant patients. The proposed
practice-based RCT is designed to meet the following specific aims:
 Aim 1: Implement IMPaCT, an innovative, tailored adherence intervention delivered by a pharmacist and
 CHW team.
 Aim 2: Determine the short- and long-term effectiveness of IMPaCT by assessing pre- to post-intervention
 changes in: a) medication adherence (proximal outcome) and blood pressure (BP, distal outcome), and b)
 other comorbid health outcomes (e.g., HbA1c, BMI) using a randomized controlled trial.
 Aim 3: Identify factors associated with IMPaCT effectiveness including: a) tailored intervention features, b)
 medication beliefs, c) barriers to adherence, d) intervention dose, e) health literacy, and f) cultural group.
We will follow an intention-to-treat randomized design using a waitlist control with 450 African-American,
Latino, and Vietnamese patients with hypertension and low (<80%) medication adherence. Data collection via
pill count, self-report, the electronic health record, and clinical measures will assess medication adherence, BP
and other factors at baseline (pre-intervention) and at 4, 10, and 24 weeks post-intervention. IMPaCT is an
innovative coordinated care team intervention to improve medication adherence and blood pressure derived
from research findings that builds on existing clinical practice. Designed with an eye towards sustainability,
IMPaCT incorporates billable pharmacist and CHW services for patients with low medication adherence and
high burdens of chronic illness and preventable consequences. IMPaCT offers interprofessional team care with
comprehensive expertise and complementary skill sets that mitigate the silo effect of specialized medicine to
deliver primary care to diverse, high-risk populations experiencing disparities in hypertension."

The impressive success of cancer immune therapy reached its limitations and failed in its efficacy with immune
deserted KRAS mutated tumors that constitute 45% of colorectal cancers. These patients have fewer
treatment options necessitating the development of effective alternate therapy. Of late reovirus, with a double-
stranded RNA genome, showed therapeutic efficacy in an oncogenic KRAS transformed colorectal tumors.
Although previously studied for its oncolytic properties reovirus is being increasingly appreciated for its immune
stimulation properties. However, its participation in immune stimulation, precisely utilizing two intimately related
immune and autophagic modulatory pathways, remains largely unexplored. Preliminary results indicate that
reovirus preferentially exploits the immune deserted mutant KRAS tumor microenvironment to successfully
support its propagation in conjunction with destruction of the tumor cells. Furthermore, reovirus induces
autophagy in KRAS mutated microenvironment. Knowledge gaps: It is crucial to understand the mechanism
adopted by reovirus to facilitate the immune enrichment of mutant KRAS driven immune deserted
microenvironment in colorectal cancer. The contribution of autophagic pathway in accentuating the process is
unclear. Understanding the control mechanism between the autophagy and immune pathways is critical.
Project hypothesis: The dual mode of action exerted by reovirus can be successfully translated to the clinic by
augmenting the induction of the autophagy pathway. We propose to study the pattern of reovirus mediated
induction of the autophagic machinery and determine how the molecular event is translated in improving the
immune stimulation characteristics in KRAS mutated colorectal Cancer. In this context we will make use of
KRAS mutant and wildtype colorectal cancer cell lines and our newly developed KPC:APC (tamoxifen-
inducible KRAS-mutated colorectal cancer) mouse models along with the well-established syngeneic mouse
model of colorectal cancer to mechanistically explore the process of crosstalk between the two pathways.
Results will improve the understanding of the dynamics of KRAS mutated immune deserted cold tumors in
facilitating reovirus to act as an immune stimulator Impact: This project will have dual impact of providing an
enriched biomedical science related research environment to the aspiring undergraduate students as well as to
directly address the clinical gap faced by the KRAS mutated colorectal cancer patients. Understanding the
mechanism of cross talk between the autophagy and immune pathways followed by research supported
recommendation of therapeutic induction of autophagy to improve immune therapy responsiveness of KRAS
mutated colorectal cancer will be of paradigm clinical implications. In this pursuit we will AIM1: Demonstrate
crosstalk between autophagy and immune pathways in reovirus treated KRAS mutant and wildtype colorectal
cancer cell lines. AIM2: Examine if autophagy induction promotes reovirus mediated immune stimulation in
KRAS mutated cold colorectal tumors in transgenic and syngeneic mouse models."

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common and aggressive lymphoma. Germinal center B-cell
(GCB) and activated B-cell (ABC) are the two major biologically distinct molecular subtypes of DLBCL.
Differentiation of these subtypes is essential for the right therapy. Gene expression signatures analysis for
diagnosis or monitoring or predicting recurrence of various cancers is widely used in clinical practice. However,
current assays require multiple qPCR reactions to analyze the gene signatures, increasing the health care cost
burden. Multiplexing qPCR technologies that can detect multiple genes are of high clinical significance. To
meet this need, this SBIR Phase I application proposes to develop a single RT-qPCR reaction Zip-MeltTM
DLBCL Classifier Assay, an 18 gene expression analysis, to differentiate ABC and GCB subtypes. Our high
multiplex assay has advantages as it can be done on a small amount of precious clinical samples, will reduce
the turnaround time, and labor cost and ultimately will decrease the health care cost.
The competitive advantage of our multiplex technology is that it expands the capacity of qPCR systems, can
be easily implemented on any existing qPCR systems, reduces the operational cost, and is ecofriendly
(decrease in environmental waste from reduction in plastics and chemical reagents). This chemistry-based
multiplexing technology can be easily integrated into a point of care system to expand the capacity and the
outreach to resource limited settings. The proposed studies involve development and optimization of Zip-
MeltTM DLBCL Classifier Assay, followed by performance characteristics studies in comparison to a
Comparator Assay. This Phase I application will establish a platform for detection of gene expression signature
to meet the clinical requirement of multianalyte detection in a single workflow."

The number of children born to opioid-dependent mothers has increased over 300% in the past two decades.
As abstinence from opioids during pregnancy is not recommended, opioid medication replacement therapy, such
as methadone, represents the standard of care for pregnant women with opioid use disorder thus perpetuating
the birth of these opioid-exposed babies. Previous work has shown that prenatal opioid exposure predisposes
for future substance misuse. Given its widespread accessibility, alcohol is one of the most likely addictive sub-
stances that these prenatal opioid-exposed children will encounter. Due to the significant morbidity and mortality
associated with excessive alcohol drinking, it is critically important to understand how prenatal methadone ex-
posure (PME) predisposes these children for future problematic alcohol use and how alcohol interacts with PME
to produce differential behavioral responses to alcohol. To elucidate mechanisms related to how PME may pro-
duce enhanced alcohol-related behaviors, we developed and validated a mouse model of PME. Our model re-
capitulates many clinical features of prenatal opioid exposure, including producing neonatal opioid withdrawal.
Using our model, we find that PME increases alcohol drinking only in males, consistent with many clinical and
preclinical studies that show that males are more severely impacted by prenatal opioid exposure. Given the role
of the dorsal striatum brain region in modulating many aspects of alcohol drinking, we biochemically explored
the proteome of the dorsal striatum and found that PME had a greater effect on protein and protein phosphory-
lation expression in males than females, consistent with our drinking data. Pathway analyses of our proteomics
data implicated glutamate and long-term synaptic depression plasticity (LTD) in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS)
as being disrupted by PME. We further discovered that PME reduced dorsal striatal glutamate transmission and
disrupted LTD. Recent work from our laboratory demonstrates that alcohol induces glutamatergic synaptic plas-
ticity and disrupts LTD at anterior insular cortex inputs to the DLS (AICDLS synapses) in mice, but only in male
mice and this was associated with enhanced male alcohol drinking behavior. We reasoned that the male-specific,
PME-induced increase in binge-like alcohol consumption may utilize similar mechanisms as the male-specific,
alcohol-induced AICDLS synaptic changes that govern excessive alcohol consumption. We hypothesize that
PME produces synaptic adaptations exclusively in males that enhance AICDLS glutamatergic transmission
that in turn govern the elevated binge-like alcohol consumption seen in male, but not female PME mice. In this
project we will use a multidisciplinary approach combining home-cage binge drinking with brain slice electro-
physiology, dorsal striatal cell type reporter mice, quantitative synaptic proteomics, ultrastructural expansion mi-
croscopy, and wireless in vivo optogenetic manipulations of synaptic transmission. This project will provide crit-
ical neural mechanistic knowledge for deciphering how PME enhances future alcohol drinking behavior in males
and why females may be resistant or resilient to the effects of PME."

 Of the ~600,000 annual cardiac arrest events in the USA, <7% result in survival with a good neurological 
outcome. Patient heterogeneity and variations in emergency care affect ischemia time, rates of resuscitation, 
and post-resuscitation outcomes. The early hours after resuscitation are a critical window to promote cell 
recovery. This project builds upon a robust post-resuscitation clinical program and our prior work identifying 
unique neutrophil populations and their interactions with lymphocytes in “post-cardiac arrest syndrome” in 
humans. In our patients, low numbers of CD73-expressing (CD73+) lymphocytes after resuscitation and a high 
neutrophil to CD73+ lymphocyte ratio are each associated with worse outcomes. CD73 is a key enzyme in the 
generation of adenosine, which is neuroprotective and regulates vasoreactivity. Because increased duration of 
ischemia also increases risk of poor outcome, we predict that the longer ischemic times associated with 
cardiac arrest in patients living in rural areas will be reflected in fewer CD73+ circulating lymphocytes post- 
resuscitation. We expect regional differences in emergency care to contribute to heterogeneity of the 
inflammatory response, emphasizing the importance of diversity and inclusion in cardiac arrest research. In 
addition to our clinical observations, our studies show critical immunomodulatory effects of CD73+ 
lymphocytes on neutrophil activation, specifically on a novel subpopulation of highly inflammatory neutrophils 
we have named cardiac arrest-associated neutrophils (CAANs). We will characterize molecular signaling 
associated with CD73+ lymphocytes with respect to neutrophil and endothelial cell function. We hypothesize 
that activation of CD73+ lymphocytes is an acute protective response to whole-body ischemia-reperfusion 
injury that dampens the inflammatory consequences of global ischemia. Further, we predict that low numbers 
of CD73+ lymphocytes correlate with pathological neutrophil activation and impaired endothelial function, 
leading to decreased blood flow at end-vascular territories and tissue infarction in the brain and other 
vulnerable organs. Our aims are to: 1) determine the inflammatory profiles and associated clinical phenotypes 
in cardiac arrest patients with varying levels of CD73+ lymphocytes, and 2) characterize the effects of CD73+ 
lymphocytes against neutrophil-mediated injury to the endothelial cell barrier. 
 This is the first major attempt to characterize the cellular immune response after resuscitation from cardiac 
arrest, and represents a novel translational research direction for Dr. David Seder, an experienced clinical 
trialist. Dr. Seder will expand his clinical research skills into laboratory-based skills in molecular phenotyping of 
human-derived inflammatory cells, and receive mentorship from senior physician-scientists with successful 
careers in patient care, academic medicine, and clinical and translational research (C. Rosen and D. Sawyer). 
The completion of this study will set the stage for novel interventional trials to improve cardiac arrest outcomes."

An estimated 62% (37 million) of Mexican-origin (MO) adults in the U.S. are predisposed to non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD), an emerging risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This is of particular
concern in the Southern Arizona U.S.-Mexico border region as liver disease and liver cancer, are among the
leading causes of death for MO adults. Significant disparities in the incidence and mortality of HCC in the U.S.
exist across racial/ethnic and gender groups. Specifically, HCC incidence rates are two-fold higher in Hispanic
populations overall compared to non-Hispanic whites. Further, HCC is one of the most fatal cancers; the 5-year
cause-specific survival for Hispanics is 19%, rendering it the 3rd leading cause of cancer death in Hispanic
men and the 5th leading cause in Hispanic women. Despite MO experiencing higher rates and worse
outcomes for NAFLD and HCC compared to all racial and ethnic groups and other Hispanic populations, our
preliminary work suggest awareness of NAFLD is low in Southern Arizona. Therefore, there is a critical need to
improve liver disease and cancer health literacy for MO adults to reduce the disparities among this high-risk
population. In the absence of such tools, the prevalence, morbidity, and economic costs associated with
NAFLD and HCC in this population are likely to continue rising. The proposed research will address this gap by
implementing a culturally tailored, multi-channel educational communication campaign to increase knowledge
and public awareness of liver disease and liver cancer risk factors in MO. To achieve this objective, we will
leverage our current screening and education efforts for liver disease prevention and treatment in Southern
Arizona, the University of Arizona Cancer Center (UACC) catchment area. Further, we will leverage a NAFLD
awareness multi-media educational communication campaign developed in partnership with El Rio Community
Health Center, a Federally Qualified Health Center, including community-based education supported by
promotoras de salud (community health workers). For Track 2: General Population aged 30+ years, we will (1)
evaluate the effectiveness of a culturally tailored, multi-channel educational communication campaign to
improve knowledge and public awareness of liver disease and liver cancer risk factors in MO communities in
Southern Arizona; and (2) determine the impact of promotora-led outreach, engagement, and education for
cancer prevention and treatment in community-based settings. The proposed project will provide much needed
evidence to inform the Community Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for engaging promotoras
to increase knowledge and public awareness of liver disease and liver cancer risk factors in MO, particularly for
this high-risk, underserved population."

11134951,"Abstract
 Cryptococcal meningitis (CM), caused by the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn), is
among the most prevalent HIV/AIDS-associated opportunistic infections and causes 15% of AIDS-
related mortality globally. In healthy individuals, exposure to Cn in early childhood results in a
pulmonary latent infection that is asymptomatic, but leads to the formation of lung granulomas.
Following HIV-associated compromise of the immune system, control of latent Cn infection within
pulmonary granulomas is lost and the fungus disseminates to cause meningitis.
 Most studies examining host-pathogen interactions in Cn are observational studies in human
cohorts or analyze reference Cn strains in acute disease models of cryptococcosis. We recently
showed that the mouse model accurately recapitulates differences in human survival that are
observed across Cn clinical isolates and used these data to develop a mouse model of latent Cn
infection. Our preliminary data using these mouse models to analyze the immune response to over 50
Cn clinical isolates from individuals with advanced HIV revealed a continuum of disease outcomes
that we classified into 3 groups: 1) latent infection resulting in granuloma formation and control; 2)
lethal disease similar to that observed with Cn reference strains; and 3) hypervirulence resulting in
rapid mortality. Previous studies with reference strains revealed lethal disease is associated with
various Cn virulence factors and a detrimental host Th2-mediated type-2 immune response. In
contrast, disease prevention is associated with the type-1 cytokine IFNγ. How these Cn-host
interactions differ to cause the continuum of disease observed in immunocompromised individuals
with HIV is not well defined.
 We will use analysis of clinical isolates in mouse models of disease to test our central
hypothesis that antigenic differences between Cn clinical isolates lead to either protective or
detrimental immune responses in the host. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing three specific
aims. Our first and second aims will determine the host cellular and effector functions that result in
either latency (Aim 1), lethal disease (control infections), or hypervirulence (Aim 2). Our third aim will
identify Cn gene alleles for antigens that influence the immune response and ultimately disease
outcome. Taken together, these translational studies will define the molecular processes underlying
the continuum of Cryptococcus disease with the goal of developing novel immune-modulatory
treatment strategies for at-risk patient populations."
11135825,"The majority of current strategies aiming to prevent, control or eradicate HIV rely on harnessing effector functions
of cytotoxic T cells, helper T cells, B cells and antibodies to attack HIV and HIV-infected cells. However, natural
killer (NK) cells might represent the ideal subset of antiviral effector cells to promptly and potently respond to
HIV exposure. Classically, NK cells are viewed as nonspecific effector cells of the innate immune system that
play critical roles in defense against viral infections, including HIV. Besides their ability to rapidly eliminate virus-
infected cells without the need for prior antigen sensitization, several independent studies from the past 12 years
have demonstrated that subsets of murine, non-human primate (NHP) and human NK cells are capable of
adaptive immune functions, including antigen-specificity and recall responses. Our laboratories provided the first
clear evidence of antigen-specific NK cell memory in a primate species, elicited by HIV/SIV infection and
vaccination. Preliminary data presented in this application now show that antigen-specific NK cell memory with
potent antiviral functions develops upon exposure to HIV in humans and provide the first mechanistic evidence
for antigen-specific NK cell memory, strongly supporting a role for HLA-E and its activating ligand NKG2C in
antigen-specific NK cell responses. Collectively, these findings suggest that antiviral functions of adaptive NK
cells have tremendous potential to be exploited for vaccine design, curative or other therapeutic interventions
against HIV. However, the most significant obstacles to harnessing adaptive NK cell functions is the opacity
surrounding the mechanisms of their formation and their potential to mediate protection in primate species. In
this study, we propose to address the overarching hypothesis that adaptive NK cell responses develop
kinetically to inhibit SIV/HIV replication and use disparate mechanisms of MHC recognition and
alternative epigenetic and metabolic programs through two focused yet independent Aims: (i) Define in vitro
and in vivo mechanisms of MHC-E-restricted NK cell antigen specificity against HIV and SIV infections;
and (ii) Delineate NK cell-specific molecular programs influencing adaptive NK cell formation against
HIV and SIV. Taken together, these investigations will provide critical information on the development of antigen-
specific memory NK cells against SIV/HIV and determine the capacity of this NK cell subset to control viral
replication. If successful, these studies will identify clear pathways that could be exploited to further enhance
adaptive NK cell antiviral activity in future HIV vaccine and/or cure strategies."

 Peripheral neuropathy and neuropathy pain can be caused by a myriad of genetic and environment
factors as well as therapeutic or recreational drug use. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is
the major dose-limiting neurotoxic side effect of standard chemotherapy regiments. Over 68% of cancer patients
experience neuropathic symptoms after chemotherapy, and that contributes to a significant percent of the
population that suffer from chronic pain and often resort to opioid use. Peripheral neuropathy is closely
associated with Alzheimer’s related dementia. Specifically, a negative correlation between the severity of
peripheral neuropathy and cognitive performance has been reported in patients with dementia. The mechanisms
of CIPN and Alzheimer’s related neuropathy intersect at the dysregulation of neuronal microtubules. CIPN is
caused by microtubule-targeting chemo drugs, while a major pathology in AD is the dysregulation of microtubule
associated protein Tau (tauopathy). There is an urgent need to understand the in vivo mechanisms of CIPN and
AD related peripheral neuropathy. Recently, we have optimized a model of peripheral neuropathy using
Drosophila larvae that recapitulates salient behavioral, physiological, and cellular aspects of sensory dysfunction.
Our work using this model has uncovered a new mechanism underlying peripheral neuropathy and identified a
neuroprotective protein NMNAT with promising potential for mitigating neuropathic pain. Our preliminary studies
have identified several natural compounds that potentially upregulate NMNAT transcription and discovered the
exciting role of microRNAs in regulating both the pre-mRNA splicing and mature mRNA stability. The aims of
the parent R33 grant include, (1) test the neuroprotective activity of 9 microRNAs that regulate nociceptive
hypersensitivity and pain, (2) characterize the molecular pharmacology of 13 natural compounds in regulating
NMNAT expression and enhancing neuroprotection against peripheral neuropathy and chronic pain. The
objectives for the supplement application are to expand our testing portfolio to include genetic models of
Alzheimer’s disease and identify microRNAs and natural compounds that mitigate peripheral neuropathy in AD.
We have established Tauopathy models that recapitulate cellular pathology of Alzheimer’s including filamentous
accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau (pTau), neuronal degeneration, impaired nervous system physiology,
and shorted survival. Our preliminary pain behavior studies in AD models have observed a hypersensitivity to
pain in mutant hTau (hTauR406W) expressing nociceptors, consistent with clinical presentation of peripheral
neuropathy in AD patients. We propose to test our hypothesis that the neuronal microtubule dysregulation in
nociceptor neurons is a shared cellular mechanism underlying CIPN and AD induced pain. The proposed
supplement work is within the scope of the parent R33 project but expands the outcome to include I) mechanistic
characterization of microRNAs and natural compounds that augment NMNAT-mediate protection against
neuropathic pain in AD, and II) identify shared cellular mechanisms between CIPN and AD."
11140811,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (nCRT) followed by surgery is the standard of care for patients with
locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), which accounts for ~60% of newly diagnosed rectal cancer cases.
Although nCRT benefits many patients, it is currently not known who will or will not respond favorably. About
20% patients that receive nCRT will experience a pathologic complete response (pCR), while ~25% patients will
exhibit no response. Recently, several clinical trials have assessed new treatment paradigms, and their results
present new treatment strategies which were previously not available for LARC patients. With the availability of
these new strategies, it is crucial to be able to a priori identify LARC patients, via a predictive biomarker, who
have a higher likelihood of responding or not responding to nCRT.
 Our goal is to optimize and validate an efficient assay that is accurate, precise, and minimally invasive
to assess biomarker(s) that will predict response to nCRT in the setting of LARC. The assay that will be validated
in this proposal is a Luminex multiplexed assay that uses the xMAP technology. We have defined six candidate
biomarkers that will be validated in this study. Here, using the optimized and validated assay we will then achieve
the clinical validation of the candidate biomarker(s) in a real-world clinical laboratory setting using LARC patient
specimens. At the end of this study, we will achieve a minimally invasive, blood-based assay for patient
treatment stratification which will be of tremendous benefit to LARC patient(s) and the healthcare system.
 Using the xMAP assay, we are detecting candidate biomarkers of DNA damage response (DDR)
signaling in cell lysates from cryopreserved peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) of LARC patients. In our
preliminary work, the change in the expression of these biomarkers significantly associated with response to
nCRT in LARC patients. These candidate biomarkers were identified through our recent hypothesis-driven
translational study funded by the DOD. This proposal was developed through a collaboration between the two
primary investigators bringing together complementary expertise. The assembled multi-disciplinary team brings
together expertise in clinical and basic science, assay development/validation, and their clinical deployment.
 Here, we will analytically validate our assay (UH2 phase) and then establish the clinical validity by using
biospecimens from LARC patients (UH3 phase). The biospecimens used are from LARC patients and healthy
controls from the Fox Chase BioSample Repository Facility, and from LARC clinical studies/trials evaluating
therapeutic response. In the UH2 phase we will perform pre-analytical (biospecimen variability) and analytical
(e.g., precision, accuracy) validation. In the UH3 phase, we will establish clinical validity by evaluating clinical
utility parameters (e.g., sensitivity/specificity, optimal cut-offs) and compare with nCRT response status.
 Successful completion will yield validated biomarkers/assays for use as investigational assays in clinical
trials/studies. Over the long-term, this work may improve patient stratification for treatment in LARC patients."

11137246,"Project Abstract/Summary
The vast amount of health data created in the United States may hold the key to understanding disease,
improving quality, and lowering healthcare costs. Electronic health records (EHRs), digital collections of patient
healthcare events and observations, are now ubiquitous in medicine and critical to healthcare delivery,
operations, and research. EHR data is often classified as structured or unstructured. Structured EHR data
include standardized diagnoses, medications, and laboratory values in fixed numerical or categorical fields. For
structured data, challenges such as missing, incomplete, and inconsistent data are very prevalent.
Unstructured data, in contrast, refer to free-form text written by healthcare providers, such as clinical notes and
discharge summaries. Dental care providers often write detailed findings, diagnoses, treatment plans and
prognostic factors in free-text format for clinical care purposes. While this information is easily accessible during
patient care, extracting it for generating meaningful insights for secondary analysis can be challenging. Utilizing
these records requires manual review by domain experts, which can be time-consuming and costly, particularly
when dealing with a large number of patient records. Unstructured data represents about 60% of total EHR data.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and newer deep learning approaches to Natural Language Processing
(NLP) have made considerable advances, outperforming traditional statistical and rule-based systems on a
variety of tasks.
To fully realize the promise of health information technology in dentistry, it is important to address data
missingness and disparity in missingness. Through a periodontal use-case, this proposal will tackle the challenge
of missing structured, and ‘technically’ inaccessible, unstructured clinical data. Periodontal (advanced gum
disease) problems are very pervasive, and unlike caries (whose prevalence has steadily declined over the past
four decades), disease burden and tooth loss secondary to periodontal disease remain intractable. In preliminary
work at two dental institutions, we observed that most patients seen for a comprehensive oral evaluation had
missing or incomplete documentation with respect to clinical periodontal indices/diagnosis, demographic, and
health-related behavior information – all of which are critical in diagnosing and treating periodontal disease. This
significantly limits our ability to learn and improve. Aim 1 will focus on using LLM-based NLP approaches for the
conversion of unstructured note entries into structured and machine-readable information. In Aim 2, we will use
imputation techniques to fill in missing structured clinical data entries. Aim 3 will then evaluate the impact of
reduction in clinical data missingness for both clinical and research applications. This work builds on our prior
work in developing the BigMouth Dental Data Repository (which contains regularly updated structured data on
4.6 million patients). We will be supported by the collective strength of the 11 core BigMouth, and other allied
dental institutions that currently share and/or contribute data to the repository."

Sensory over-responsivity (SOR), or strong negative reactions to and avoidance of innocuous sensory stimuli,
affects about one in five school-age children and about two-thirds of children with autism spectrum disorder
(ASD) and several other common neurodevelopmental disorders. Children with SOR experience considerable
short- and long-term distress and impairment including fear and anxiety, poor sleep and nutrition, isolating social
difficulties, and increased risk of mental illness. The cost of SOR in childhood is compounded by its disruption of
developmentally appropriate social and situational experiences and its deleterious effects on family functioning.
Despite its prevalence and impact on health and wellbeing, the causes of SOR are poorly understood and
existing treatment approaches have met with limited success. Identifying the specific neural mechanisms that
are disrupted in SOR could provide insights into its etiology and suggest promising approaches for developing
effective interventions. Studies of typical sensory processing have revealed basic neural mechanisms that
promote adaptive sensory responses, highlighting a powerful new translational approach to investigating the
neural bases of SOR. The goal of this K99/R00 Pathway to Independence Award is to provide the applicant with
the training needed to test if these neural mechanisms are disrupted in children with SOR and to support her
continued success as an independent investigator. To achieve this goal, the applicant has assembled a
committee of exceptional mentors and experts who will provide her with training in clinical presentations and
assessments of ASD and SOR (Drs. Constantino, Sylvester, Green, and Pruett), administering functional MRI
scans to children with and without ASD and SOR (Drs. Green, Sylvester, Dapretto, Pruett, and Dosenbach),
applying multilevel models to complex datasets (Dr. Jackson), and developing skills for success as an
independent investigator at a major research institution (all committee members). The proposed training will
allow the applicant to test predictions about the relationship between one neural mechanism (suppression) and
SOR in children using existing data and to pilot a functional MRI task to assess a second neural mechanism
(surprise) in children during the K99 phase. Results from this work will inform the R00 phase, which will entail
testing whether three neural mechanisms (adaptation, suppression, and surprise) are attenuated in sensory and
fronto-limbic brain areas of children with SOR, both with and without ASD. This innovative research approach
will clarify whether predictive mechanisms are disrupted in children with SOR and localize disruptions to specific
brain areas, advancing scientific understanding of SOR and highlighting promising targets for interventions to be
tested in a R01. Collectively, the proposed training and research will provide the applicant with the data, tools,
and skills needed to launch a successful career at a top-tier research institution."

This project is focused on developing an automated clinical decision support tool for predicting
Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) risk and severity based on historical imaging and clinical data.
Despite the high prevalence and urgency of this critical public health issue, there is currently no
objective tool to diagnose IPV. The challenges in detecting IPV in the health care setting are
due to multiple factors, including the patient’s feelings of shame and fear of consequences and
physician’s lack of awareness and fear of offending the patient and partner. While imaging plays
an essential role in diagnosing nonaccidental trauma in children because of clear well-
established patterns of abuse on imaging studies, a lack of evidence-based research on IPV
related imaging patterns has led to under-recognition and underdiagnosis of IPV. By recognizing
location and imaging patterns specific to IPV on current and previous radiological studies,
radiologists can help identify IPV when the victims are not forthcoming. Our hypothesis is that a
multidimensional clinical support tool including imaging and clinical findings harvested from the
electronic medical record can provide an accurate and comprehensive calculation of IPV risk.
The automated IPV risk and severity predictions can then be integrated to transform the care
plan for survivors and make the “invisible” visible.
Aim 1: To define IPV related imaging patterns and severity by analyzing radiological studies of
known IPV survivors and matched controls
Aim 2: To determine IPV risk and severity prediction by developing a clinical decision support
tool derived from historical imaging and clinical predictors.
Aim 3: To validate the IPV prediction model on new datasets and evaluate the integration of
results in radiology workflow using a safe repository.
If our hypotheses are correct, established IPV related imaging patterns, a CDS tool derived from
historical imaging and clinical predictors integrated into clinical care will be able to diagnose IPV
objectively."
11137941,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute pancreatitis (AP) is increasingly recognized in children, with an incidence approaching
that of adults. Most children with pancreatitis have a single, mild, acute episode that resolves
without complications. However, a subset of children with AP develops recurrent episodes
(defined as acute recurrent pancreatitis or ARP) and some progress to chronic pancreatitis
(CP). Pediatric ARP and CP significantly impact quality of life and carry high healthcare costs.
Few studies have been performed to characterize the natural history pediatric ARP and CP, to
identify its risk factors and to determine predictors of disease course. As INSPPIRE
(INternational Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In search for a cuRE), the first multicenter,
multidisciplinary collaboration in pediatric pancreatitis, we determined that children with ARP
harbor multiple genetic risk variants and rapidly transition to CP, exocrine pancreatic
insufficiency (EPI) and diabetes mellitus (DM). The risk factors that predispose children to
early onset pancreatitis, rapid progression to CP and premature loss of exocrine and
endocrine function are not well-known. The objective of this application is to delineate the
natural history of pediatric CP through careful prospective analysis of INSPPIRE 2 cohort, to
define the impact of genetic modifiers on disease course and to determine the mechanisms
involved in pancreatogenic diabetes mellitus (T3cDM). The overall hypothesis is that genetic
factors predispose children to early onset CP, EPI, and DM. Our specific aims are: 1)
Characterize pediatric CP, determine predictors of disease onset and progression; 2) Determine
the impact of genetic variants on disease onset and progression; 3) Identify mechanisms
underlying disturbed glucose regulation in pediatric ARP and CP. This project will provide
insight into the pathophysiology of pediatric pancreatitis, investigate the impact of genetic
variants on disease course and explore the mechanisms of early islet cell dysfunction in
pediatric ARP and CP. Our long-term goal is to develop diagnostic modalities, prognostic factors
and innovative treatment approaches for pediatric ARP and CP."

11140660,"PROJECT 1 ABSTRACT - RSV and asthma: Defining the influence of host and exposure variation on disease
development
 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) is strongly and consistently
associated with asthma. While this has been repeatedly demonstrated for decades, rather limited progress has
been made on further understanding the causal association between RSV LRI and wheezing illnesses over the
more than 50 years since the observation was first published. In our prior funding cycle we have demonstrated
the relationship between a severe infection with RSV and asthma is confounded by a shared genetic
predisposition to both conditions. We have also demonstrated that infant RSV infection, not only severe
infection, is associated with increased asthma risk, and that missing RSV infection during infancy significantly
protects from asthma development. To understand pathways through which RSV contributes to asthma
development we have demonstrated that infant RSV infection alters the developing nasal microbiome and type
1 anti-viral responses, and we have identified specific RSV strains associated with increased asthma risk. This
U19 renewal expands upon this series of significant findings to answer key questions to assess causality and
inform targetable asthma prevention. Our overarching hypothesis is that age-dependent effects of infant RSV
infection contribute to chronic respiratory disease through altering airway epithelial DNA methylation (DNAm),
and airway epithelial metabolism and developmental programming. Further, we hypothesize that identifying
gene x RSV interactions will explain individual variability in asthma susceptibility following infant RSV infection.
 To test these hypotheses we will use a combination of human natural quasi-randomization studies of
infant RSV infection specifically designed to assess the impact of infant RSV infection on subsequent
respiratory health and the airway epithelium, and in vitro models of RSV infection of nasal airway epithelial
cells (NAECs). The overarching objectives of the 3 aims that will test these hypotheses are: 1) to determine
whether the age of first infant RSV infection is associated with risk of subsequent incident recurrent wheeze
and asthma; 2) to delineate the longitudinal effects of RSV on airway epithelial cell differentiation and
metabolism throughout infancy and childhood; 3) to evaluate host gene ´ infant RSV infection interactions and
RSV-dependent NAEC DNAm longitudinally to identify changes and temporal stability of RSV-dependent
DNAm marks and their association with recurrent wheeze and asthma.
 This proposal has the potential to greatly advance our understanding of the mechanisms and
developmental processes underlying the effect of RSV on recurrent wheeze and asthma, and to identify novel
targetable pathways for prevention of acute RSV morbidity, childhood recurrent wheeze and asthma."
11140591,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Project 3
The overall objective and significance of Project 3 is to generate preclinical validation of nasal microbiota-based
therapeutics to block nasal colonization by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Our
innovative approach to achieve this is to cultivate human nasal bacteria on human nasal organoids. Together,
S. aureus and S. pneumoniae account for 39% of cases and 29% of deaths attributed to antibiotic-resistant
bacteria in the U.S. Nasal colonization is the primary source of invasive infection by each and the reservoir for
their transmission; blocking colonization reduces both infection and transmission. Lacking effective vaccines
against S. aureus or nonvaccine serotypes of S. pneumoniae, there is an urgent need for new nonantibiotic
approaches to prevent infections by both. Current therapies for nasal decolonization of S. aureus depend on a
topical antibiotic and are temporally correlated with rising antibiotic resistance. Here, we address a gap in
knowledge in how to repopulate with pathobiont-resistant microbiota to improve long-term outcomes. Multiple
nasal microbiota studies report benign bacterial species present when adults are free of S. aureus and when
children are free of S. pneumoniae. For example, nasal colonization by the benign bacterium Dolosigranulum
pigrum, often with harmless Corynebacterium, is associated with the absence of S. pneumoniae in children. In
adults, D. pigrum is inversely associated with S. aureus nasal colonization. Our preliminary data indicate many
strains of D. pigrum inhibit S. aureus growth in vitro. Also, cocultivation of D. pigrum with Corynebacterium
pseudodiphtheriticum robustly inhibits S. pneumoniae growth in vitro, versus either alone. Moreover,
Corynebacterium enhance D. pigrum growth. Thus, our overarching hypothesis is that reproducible consortia of
benign human nasal bacteria can confer colonization resistance to S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, preventing
infection by and transmission of these antibiotic-resistant threats. Moreover, antipathobiont mucosal-active lytic
phage may augment this. Networks of interactions underpin microbiota composition. Relying on consortia avoids
the risk of unexpected community interactions that can occur when adding a single strain and increases the
likelihood of successful repopulation with a desired community. A major hurdle to clinical trials is to identify fully
defined consortia of benign nasal bacterial strains that confer colonization resistance in the context of human
nasal epithelium and promote a healthy, intact epithelial barrier. Our Organoid Cultivation Core has successfully
generated human airway organoids. Thus, we will overcome this hurdle using advances in nasal epithelial
organoids combined with our expertise in cultivating human nasal bacteria and identifying molecular mechanisms
of interactions within nasal microbiota. With methods routinely used by us, Project 1 and the Organoid Cultivation
Core, we will achieve two aims: identify and characterize reproducible human nasal microbial consortia to 1)
protect nasal epithelium from colonization by S. aureus/S. pneumoniae and 2) to promote epithelial barrier
integrity and block epithelial invasion by S. aureus/S. pneumoniae in vitro, and identify underlying mechanisms."
11135805,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is an unmet need in the HIV vaccine field for immunogens that consistently elicit potent serum antibodies
that neutralize a broad spectrum of HIV-1 variants in circulation worldwide. Recently, we identified a novel target
for human neutralizing antibodies (NAbs): the eight N-terminal amino acids of the fusion peptide (FP) on
prefusion HIV-1 envelope (Env) trimer (Science 2016). We then created a novel immunization strategy: priming
with FP conjugated to the carrier protein keyhole limpet hemocyanin (FP-KLH) and boosting with HIV-1 Env
trimer. This strategy has reproducibly elicited FP-directed cross-reactive NAbs in multiple studies involving mice,
guinea pigs and non-human primates (NHPs), although not in every animal (Nat Med 2018, Cell 2019). The best
monoclonal antibody (mAb) from an immunized NHP neutralized 98% of 58 wild-type HIV-1 strains with FP
sequence matching the immunogen, and 59% of 208 strains that represent viruses worldwide and contain
diverse FP sequences. Therefore, FP prime/Env boost is a promising strategy for eliciting NAb responses. To
further improve FP-directed vaccine design, two main limitations need to be addressed. First, the neutralization
breadth of the polyclonal sera from immunized animal is still limited. Second, the cross-neutralizing activities
were only observed in a small subset of immunized animals and were generally low-titer. To address these
limitations, in this proposal, we will develop novel FP immunogens and immunization strategies to improve the
breadth (Aim 1), magnitude (Aim 2) and quality (Aim 3) of the FP-directed responses in guinea pigs and non-
human primates."

11136707,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Highly multiplexed imaging methods such as CycIF, CODEX, mxIF, MIBI, and IMC are providing
remarkable insight into tumor micro-environments, but they suffer from substantial variability between
runs and substantial differences from one technology to the next. The reasons for changes in staining
intensity with cycle number are not fully known, but it appears that it is absolute intensity rather than
morphology that is variable. Variability in staining intensity severely limits the ability to create large
multi-specimen datasets within a single lab (due to batch effects) and it precludes comparison across
laboratories and institutions. A central goal of this proposal is to leverage micro-capsule technology to
develop reliable calibration standards and software algorithms that use these standards for data
normalization. A set of standards would allow systematic comparison between experimental methods,
which has been a persistent problem in the field. Quality control and calibration are also essential
elements in the implementation of CLIA-compatible workflows for clinical use. Thus, we propose that
developing calibration standards is urgently needed to accelerate development of both antibody and
nucleic-acid based spatial profiling methods for studying tumors.
To achieve this goal, this administrative supplement will build a new collaboration between the labs of
Drs. Klein, Pfister and Santagata who are supported by an R33 IMAT grant (Klein) and a U01 ITCR
grant (Pfister and Santagata). The proposal brings together two efforts: micro-capsule technology,
and spatial multi-omic computational image analysis. The project proposes to use micro-capsule
technology to develop these much-needed imaging calibration standards.
The goal is realized through two aims. In the first aim, we adapt computational image analysis tools
from Pfister and Santagata labs to register, detect, segment, and normalize data from sequential
imaging of capsules. This aim is stand-alone, as it directly advances the original goals of Klein’s IMAT
grant. In the second aim, we generate imaging calibration standards using cell lysates in micro-
particles, then evaluate them as standards for multiplexed imaging, and building on Aim 1 we
establish computational tools for building calibration into imaging tasks."
10766674,"All positive-strand RNA viruses require host membranes for multiplication, even non-enveloped viruses like
poliovirus (PV). In some cases, viruses simply hijack host membranes and use them intact. However, in
other cases, viruses remodel the entire host lipidome to create virus-induced membranes with unique
phospholipid composition, which, in turn, confers upon these membranes unique biochemical and
biophysical properties to enable unique biological function. PV, related enteroviruses, and likely many
other viruses, fall into this latter category. What is so astonishing about the PV-induced transformations is
that they only require translation of the infecting RNA, without the need for genome replication or host
transcription. What this circumstance suggests is that post-transcriptional and/or post-translational
mechanisms exist in the mammalian cell cytoplasm capable of completely reprogramming phospholipid
biosynthesis and membrane biogenesis in a matter of minutes and that one or a few master regulators,
which can be coopted by PV, likely control these mechanisms. The overarching premise of the research
proposed during the extension is that our studies will illuminate mechanisms regulating membrane
biogenesis, function, and trafficking by understanding how PV hijacks and coopts these mechanisms. We
will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1 - Study contributions of 3CD to virion assembly, trafficking,
and egress; Aim 2 – Coopting of c-Fos by PV to induce phospholipid biosynthesis and membrane
biogenesis; and Aim 3 – Characterization of the dynamics, mechanisms, and functions of host-lipidome
remodeling during PV infection."
11140611,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Preterm birth and the hospitalization of infants in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are well-documented
as stressful events for mothers. Although maternal milk is critically important to promote optimal health and
neurodevelopment for preterm infants, the effects of maternal postnatal stress on maternal lactation and
feeding outcomes and milk composition have not been systematically examined. The goal of this proposed
Pathway to Independence Award is to pair a detailed examination of lactation and feeding outcomes for
preterm infants in the NICU with a biological systems approach to understanding human milk to examine the
hypothesis that maternal stress is associated with feeding outcomes and markers of impaired
neurodevelopment for preterm infants and alters human milk and infant gut profiles in ways that affect preterm
neurodevelopment. The proposed research directly aligns with the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development’s scientific priorities to reduce the incidence of neurodevelopmental
disorders, optimize outcomes for preterm infants by understanding nutrition/feeding and the microbiome, and
to understand human milk composition in relationship with maternal characteristics. During the K99 phase,
measurement of perceived, biological, and known maternal stressors in the NICU will be conducted and
assessed in relation to maternal lactation and feeding outcomes (milk production, mothers’ own milk vs donor
milk vs preterm formula) (Aim 1). Infants will also undergo neurodevelopmental testing via
electroencephalogram before NICU discharge and at 4 months corrected age to assess the relationship
between maternal stress and preterm neurodevelopmental outcomes (Aim 2). Career development activities in
the K99 phase, including training in stress physiology and infant neurodevelopment, developing expertise in
lactation/feeding outcomes for preterm infants in the NICU, and learning techniques for assessing human milk
and infant gut composition data and their interpretation will take place in the excellent research environment at
the University of Minnesota School of Public Health Division of Epidemiology and Community Health and will
provide the skills needed to successfully examine associations of maternal stress with characteristics of
maternal milk and preterm infant gut composition in the R00 phase. Targeted and untargeted metabolic
approaches and microbial analyses will be used to elucidate the relationships between human milk and
preterm gut composition with maternal stress and preterm neurodevelopmental (Aim 3). The proposed
research lays the groundwork for future clinical interventions designed to mitigate the effects of maternal
postnatal stress through psychosocial support and/or nutritional supplementation and will also provide
foundational data for the successful launch of an independent research career focused on promoting nutritional
practices which yield optimal neurodevelopment for preterm infants."
11140681,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Accumulating evidence suggests robustness of transcriptional regulation, yet human genetic studies indicate
phenotypic sensitivity to transcription factor (TF) dosage in both complex traits and rare disorders, motivating
quantitative studies of TF dosage effects. These features are exemplified by the development of the human
face, which is frequently disrupted in a range of syndromes with typical features. The aim of this proposal is
to develop and apply tools to precisely modulate dosage of craniofacial TFs in cranial neural crest cells, the
progenitors of the face, and assess effects across multiple biological levels – molecular, cellular, and
morphological. The proposal initially focuses on SOX9, using diverse approaches to understand the rules
that determine which regulatory elements and genes are sensitive to SOX9 dosage (Aim 1), as well as their
phenotypic consequences (Aim 2). Then, such rules will be generalized to five additional craniofacial TFs
(Aim 3) and used to dissect mechanisms underlying genetic variants associated with craniofacial
morphology or disease (Aim 4). These studies will reveal drivers of craniofacial morphological and disease
variation, provide general insights into transcriptional regulation, and help transform our approach to
studying TF function, from binary to quantitative in nature.
The proposed research, along with a comprehensive plan for my career development, combines my scientific
background and postdoctoral training in functional genomics, gene regulation, and human genetics with
opportunities for additional training in machine learning, mouse genetics, and morphological analysis. I will
be mentored by Drs. Joanna Wysocka and Jonathan Pritchard in a vibrant scientific environment (Stanford
Chemical and Systems Biology) and receive additional training from my advisory committee of Drs. James
Ferrell, Anshul Kundaje, and Benedikt Hallgrimsson.
My transition to independence will be facilitated by participation in both scientific and non-scientific trainings
and workshops, as well as experience in presenting my work at scientific conferences. I will also gain
experience mentoring students and technicians, and will hone my grant management and writing skills.
Collectively, my mentors have guided over 25 of their former postdocs to independent academic research
positions, and they will provide practical advice and feedback during my faculty job search.
My long-term career goal is to direct an independent research program aimed at understanding the
molecular underpinnings of quantitative variation in craniofacial morphology and disease risk. So far I have
achieved significant progress towards this goal through my research experience, publications, and
engagement with the broader scientific community. I firmly believe, however, that a K99 mentored phase
will maximize my chances for success by providing access to key resources and training that would be
otherwise lacking from my postdoctoral experience."

burgdorferi— patients experience mild, flu-like symptoms that can go on to become more severe. In later stages,
even after antibiotic therapy, patients can experience heart, joint, and neurological problems. The reason(s) for
persistent symptoms is poorly understood and the most debated topic in the field. The lead investigator of this
proposal discovered that B. burgdorferi sheds ~45% of its peptidoglycan (PG)—the essential component of the
bacterial cell-wall—from inside the cell, into its environment. B. burgdorferi PG can be detected in the synovial
fluid of Lyme arthritis patients' months after oral and/or intravenous antibiotics. When injected into a mouse, B.
burgdorferi PG alone, is capable of causing arthritis. Virtually all bacteria have PG but, as it turns out, B.
burgdorferi PG is chemically unique and unlike any previously studied. Real-timing PG tracking experiments in
live animals suggest that the unique features of B. burgdorferi muropeptides contributes to both half-life and
discrete tissue localization. These findings led us to hypothesize that shed B. burgdorferi PG fragments contain
unique chemical signature(s) that are required for persistence, Lyme disease pathogenesis, and arthritis. This
proposal will critically test these theories and provide a comprehensive understanding of 1) how and 2) where
PG is able to persist; 3) what molecular features contribute to PG persistence; 4) the mechanistic details that
underlie PG-induced Lyme arthritis; and 5) the importance of muropeptide shedding in the natural life cycle of B.
burgdorferi. Our proposed studies challenge conventional thinking and may lead to a paradigm shift in how we
understand Lyme disease pathogenesis. They may also lead to novel ways to treat patients suffering with Lyme
disease and post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, even after conventional therapies have failed."

Articular cartilage lines the boney surfaces of joints and efficiently transmits the high stresses that originate
with activities of daily living. However, damage to this tissue is extremely prevalent, with ~9% of the U.S.
population aged 30 and older having osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip or knee. This adversely impacts the many
Veterans with this condition, limiting their ability to carry out many activities of daily living and lowering their
overall quality of life. Unfortunately, there are very few viable treatment options for patients with damaged
articular cartilage, and most culminate in joint replacement with metal and plastic prostheses, which are prone
to wear and ultimately require revision surgery. To address this clinical need, we developed novel hydrogels
that promote the chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and provide a supportive
environment for extracellular matrix deposition and functional maturation of a cartilage-like tissue, both in vitro
and in our Yucatan minipig large animal model of cartilage repair. Moreover, we recently demonstrated that
living, engineered cartilage constructs can be formed into anatomic structures that mimic the complex
geometries of native joint surfaces. We have also developed technology that enables the permanent boney
fixation and in vivo integration of the living implant with existing bone. In this proposal, we capitalize on this
progress to address the `holy grail' of biologic joint resurfacing: replacement of the majority of a load-bearing
articular cartilage surface. Our experiment will use the femoral condyle of the Yucatan minipig as a model, and
success will be assessed via sophisticated and clinically relevant outcome measures. Once validated in this
pre-clinical setting, this technology may be directly translated into human clinical trials, and extended to other
joints in the body. Ultimately, this work may one day eliminate the need for joint replacement with metal and
plastic and alleviate the serious implications of OA in the Veteran population, as well as society as a whole."
11141571,"Neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) resulting from spinal cord injury or disorder (SCI/D) affects 80% of
individuals with SCI/D. It is also associated with peripheral neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson’s
disease, multiple sclerosis, diabetic neuropathy, or stroke. NDO causes urinary incontinence that profoundly
impacts dignified, independent living, associates with numerous comorbidities and fall risk, and is a leading
factor in functional decline among the elderly. Urinary incontinence contributes to social isolation and clinical
depression and associates with military service and post-traumatic stress disorder in Veterans.
 Restoring urine storage is consistently cited as a high priority by individuals with NDO. Continuous SNM is
an off-label treatment, which is effective for some individuals with NDO. Triggered sacral neuromodulation—in
which SNM is applied only during the portion of the bladder fill cycle where NDO occurs—could show unique
benefit in treatment in some individuals. While triggered SNM increased bladder capacity in sheep and rats,
feasibility has not yet been demonstrated in humans with NDO.
 The primary goal of this research is to demonstrate the feasibility of increasing bladder capacity and
reducing bladder filling pressures using triggered SNM in Veterans with NDO. This will expand on unique
technologies developed by our team: the UroMonitor, the Context-Aware Threshold (CAT) algorithm, and the
Application Specific Control Unit (ASCU). The UroMonitor is a small, transurethrally-inserted sensor that
wirelessly transmits bladder pressure data. CAT is a wavelet-based algorithm that detects detrusor
contractions from pressure data in real time. The ASCU is a modular neurostimulation platform supporting
wireless communication and custom control software. We will modify and integrate these technologies to
demonstrate the feasibility of automatically triggering SNM in Veterans. A secondary goal is to use the
UroMonitor to determine bladder capacity, detrusor contraction rate, and filling pressures during a
percutaneous SNM evaluation to identify individuals who respond to SNM therapy before a permanent
implantation. Both translational goals will be accomplished through two Specific Aims (SA):
 SA1 will determine the change in bladder response to conditionally-triggered SNM during natural filling
cycles after a two-week sacral neuromodulation evaluation phase in Veterans with NDO. In SA1a we will
integrate a short-range radio and low-power algorithm processor into the ASCU to trigger percutaneous SNM
under algorithm control. In SA1b we will develop and bench-validate a classification algorithm capable of
triggering SNM based on adaptive detection of detrusor contractions. In SA1c we will apply triggered SNM
using data transmitted from the UroMonitor to the ASCU. Triggered SNM will be applied for eight hours at three
timepoints in the two-week percutaneous evaluation phase in eight Veterans. Voided urine volume, time
between voids, and detrusor contraction frequency will be compared to determine change in conditional SNM
response at the two timepoints and compared to baseline. Outcome measures will be measured from validated
questionnaires, catheter-referenced bladder pressures, and collected voided urine.
 SA2 will determine change in bladder capacity, filling pressure, and detrusor contraction frequency during
natural filling cycles throughout a two-week continuous sacral neuromodulation evaluation. In SA2a we will
integrate adaptive antennas into the UroMonitor and develop an insertion tool for men and women. SA2b will
demonstrate the feasibility of using the UroMonitor to characterize NDO symptoms (bladder capacity, filling
pressure, and detrusor contraction rate) over several bladder filling/emptying cycles. Eight Veterans will
receive standard, continuous percutaneous SNM for two weeks. NDO symptoms will be measured using the
UroMonitor before SNM and after one and two weeks of continuous SNM. Accuracy of symptom quantification
will be compared to standard catheter-based testing and validated urinary behavior questionnaires."

and alumni support. GloCal is the only UC-wide global health training program, and our track record shows that
we: 1) Recruit pre- and postdoctoral trainees diverse in discipline and race [39% of U.S. trainees over the past
5 years identify as an underrepresented minority (URM)] who aspire to build interdisciplinary academic
research careers in global health; 2) Provide outstanding, interdisciplinary education and training in global
health in collaboration with faculty mentors from participating UC campuses and collaborating LMIC
institutions; and 3) Provide each trainee with a rich and enduring mentored research experience that fosters
scientific and career development in global health. The program also advances long-term objectives to 1)
Develop models of interdisciplinary, innovative global health research and training designed to ensure healthy
lives and promote well-being for all; 2) Enhance global health networks between the UC and our LMIC partners
and recruit faculty leading innovative global health research; and 3) Strengthen a sustainable and equitable
model of collaboration between the UC and our LMIC partners that develops research capacity that advances
locally-led and locally-relevant research. GloCal will recruit candidates from a pipeline of 65 T32 and 13 D43
programs. GloCal trainees are at different career stages, but all receive: 1) A 9 or 12-month, hands-on
research experience onsite with one of our LMIC partners—LMIC fellows will spend their first 2 to 3 months of
the program at UC and earn a certificate in ‘conducting global health research’; 2) A strong, interdisciplinary
mentored research experience; 3) Instruction in global health through onsite and online courses; and 4) Career
development to ensure that they attain their short-term goals and succeed in transitioning to the next career
stage. GloCal leadership and standing committees ensure that these program components form a seamless,
integrated experience supported by evaluation and continuous improvement. Strengths and innovations of the
program include: 1) A unified consortium under UCGHI that includes four UCs at the leading edge of global
health 2) Recruitment of diverse U.S. trainees across UC and the UCLA-Charles Drew University partnership;
3) Mentors offering training across diverse disciplines (e.g., medicine, nursing, dentistry, public health,
veterinary science, environmental and social sciences) and in research methods; and 4) Leveraging common
resources across the four participating UC campuses (UCGHI, CTSAs and CFARs). UCGHI is committed to
supporting the success of GloCal, as evidenced by their pledge of $600,000 in co-funding."
11136833,"Background: The VA is the largest provider of HIV care in the United States. The ~31,000 Veterans with HIV
use significantly more healthcare and have up to 2x higher risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(ASCVD) compared to uninfected Veterans. The HIV treatment cascade model includes care steps; once
people obtain remission, providers should focus on preventing ASCVD. We will extend the HIV treatment
cascade and focus on reducing ASCVD risk among people with HIV. Veterans with HIV have low perceived
risk for ASCVD and uptake of guideline-based treatment for BP is low.
Significance/Impact: The proposed intervention has the potential to reduce ASCVD events in this population
by more than a quarter and meet VA strategic priorities of: 1) improve timeliness of services; 2) focus
resources more efficiently as well as address HSR&D research priorities: 1) patient centered care, care
management, and health promotion; 2) healthcare access; 3) aging; 4) virtual care.
Innovation: The study is innovative: Cascade Model. By leveraging the HIV treatment cascade model, we will
create a pathway for ASCVD risk reduction to be added into widespread quality improvement initiatives.
Stakeholder-engaged design process. We will employ stakeholder-engaged research methods to ensure the
intervention meets the needs of patients and healthcare providers. Multi-component nurse-led intervention.
While each of the components of our intervention have an evidence base, they have not been tested together
in an HIV context. Telehealth. We will use VA Video Connect (VVC) to monitor CVD risk factors.
Specific Aims: Aim 1a: Conduct qualitative interviews with Veterans and healthcare providers to ascertain
perceptions regarding HIV and CVD risk reductions to inform intervention adaptation.
Aim 1b: Adapt the intervention to the VA HIV clinic context with key stakeholder input.
Aim 2: Evaluate the 12-month efficacy of a nurse intervention to improve systolic blood pressure in Veterans
with HIV. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that our intervention will result in a clinically significant 6mmHg
reduction in SBP over 12 months compared to those receiving [enhanced education + usual care] only. Aim 3:
Conduct an evaluation of the prevention nurse intervention. Exploratory aim: If effective, [we will conduct a
budget impact analysis] and simulate 10-year cost-effectiveness of the nurse intervention.
Methodology: We will conduct qualitative interviews with care team and Veterans to adapt the intervention in
an iterative design process. We will then conduct a RCT to evaluate an intervention to reduce ASCVD risk. The
study will be conducted in 3 clinics among HIV+ veterans (n=300) on suppressive ART with confirmed SBP
>140 mmHg, stratified by clinic site and randomized 1:1 to intervention vs. education control. The intervention
will involve 4 evidence-based components based on our prior studies and adapted to veterans with HIV: (1)
nurse-led care coordination, (2) nurse-managed medication and adherence support (3) home BP monitoring,
and (4) administered VA Video Connect (VVC). The education control will receive enhanced education and
usual care. Primary outcome: difference in 12-month systolic BP in the intervention arm vs control. Secondary
outcome: 12-month difference in non-HDL cholesterol. We will use a mixed-methods design to evaluate fidelity,
dose delivered/received, reach, recruitment, and context of the intervention.
Implementation/Next Steps: We designed the intervention with downstream implementation in view. This
includes: a fully remote delivery of the intervention to facilitate access and widespread implementation, and
guidance for selection of nurses with education / experience levels that match those of health coaches
delivering interventions within the VA. We will work with operational partners from the Office of Connected
Care and Office of HIV/AIDS care regarding implementation plans. We will disseminate a clinical program,
including scripts, and description of all intervention processes, to facilitate implementation within the VA."
11137165,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Computational modeling approaches are rarely applied to the right ventricle even though, like left
ventricular failure (LVF), right ventricular failure (RVF) is multifactorial, multiscale and causes significant
morbidity and mortality. In comparison to LVF, RVF is understudied with the important consequence that no
RV-specific therapies exist. Computational multi-scale modeling offers a unique opportunity to integrate
dysfunction manifest at multiple scales: at the organelle level, there are impairments of mitochondria, Ca2+-
handling, and myofilament function; at the tissue level, there is myocyte necrosis, apoptosis, fibrosis and capillary
rarefaction; at the organ level, hypertrophy and dilation; and at the organism level, exercise intolerance.
Moreover, computational modeling is ideally suited to answering the question: what are the relative contributions
from abnormalities at multiple scales to the overall phenotype of RVF?
We propose to answer this question with a data-driven, multiscale, computational modeling approach.
Beginning with an existing mitochondrial kinetic computational model fit to healthy and RVF mitochondrial
function, we will predict the emergence of dysfunction at the tissue-level. Then, fitting a myocardial tissue
computational model to healthy and RVF passive and active mechanics, we will predict emergence of
dysfunction at the organ-level. Finally, by adapting an existing biventricular mechanics computational model to
healthy and RVF pressure-volume dynamics, we will predict the emergence of dysfunction at the organism-level,
i.e., exercise intolerance. Model assumptions and predictions will be driven-by and tested against experimental
data collected using state-of-the-art techniques at the organelle-, tissue-, organ-, and organism-scales at multiple
time points in an established rat model of RVF. Finally, we will use our data-driven computational modeling
approach to confirm the human disease relevance of mechanisms of RVF found in rodent using our state-of-the-
art experimental techniques on human failing and nonfailing myocardium. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1: Determine the drivers of systolic dysfunction in RVF. We hypothesize that the major driver of systolic
dysfunction in RVF is impaired mitochondrial generation of ATP leading to impaired contraction of cardiac
myofilaments. We will test this hypothesis with scale-specific models and multi-scale experimental data collected
from rats with RVF.
Aim 2: Determine the drivers of diastolic dysfunction in RVF. We hypothesize that diastolic dysfunction in
RVF is driven by fibrosis and impaired myofilament relaxation. We will test this hypothesis with scale-specific
models and multi-scale experimental data collected from rats with RVF.
Aim 3: Determine the drivers of systolic and diastolic function in human RVF. Key predictions of organelle-
and tissue-scale structural and functional drivers of RVF will be tested with multiscale modeling validated with
state-of-the-art measurements at these scales in non-failing and failing human heart tissues."

Cancer and health-related community outreach and education efforts progressively rely on digital
media to reach and inform important target audiences. To address cancer disparities among
Indigenous sexual and gender minorities (SGM), the aim of this proposed project is to adapt the
existing framework from the previous MICEO grant (P30CA016056-46S2) and update cancer
health messaging with Indigenous SGM specific language, inclusive cancer health education, and
we will engage, and package cancer health messaging directly with and for Two-Spirit and
Indigenous LGBTQ+ communities as it relates to colorectal and liver cancers. The project titled
Films for Indigenous Cancer Health: Engaging Two-Spirit & Indigenous LGBTQ+ (lesbian,
gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, plus other identities) Communities (FICH: 2SLGBTQ+
Communities) will adapt cancer health messaging through short films with Two-Spirit and
Indigenous LGBTQ+ social media influencers and icons for use in community-based health
centers and is guided by the Transportation-Imagery Model of Narrative Communication. The
project will adapt practices from the previous MICEO project to integrate community-based
practice, prevention messaging, cancer screening information to increase cancer-based
knowledge (specific to colorectal and liver cancers), intent, and behaviors among Indigenous
SGM communities. This will be accomplished by collaborative efforts from an NCI-designated
cancer center’s Department of Indigenous Cancer Health, Community Outreach and
Engagement, Health Communications Resources and Medical Illustrators alongside Indigenous
media networks and community-based film companies. Objectives include film creation, hosting
screenings at Two-Spirit and Indigenous LGBTQ+ gatherings (powwows, Two-Spirit society
events, etc.), panel discussions with film creators and Indigenous influencers/icons, and the
embedment of films into the cancer center’s Indigenous outreach, engagement, and prevention
digital repository. Evaluative efforts include co-produced films guided by an intertribal community
advisory board with Indigenous SGM representation, pre-post surveys on knowledge, attitude,
cancer prevention, and screening behaviors. The long-term goal is the continuance of community
outreach for Indigenous communities, Indigenous urban centers with sustainable integration into
Indigenous and SGM health service delivery systems. Overall, results are expected to increase
community-based collaborative efforts through health messaging and serve as a model for
Indigenous SGM inclusion in cancer health education practices."
11141544,"Veterans with transtibial amputation require a prosthesis to walk and are at an increased risk of secondary
injury, discomfort, and reduced quality of life. Proper prosthetic alignment can reduce these risks and improve
functional ability and comfort in individuals with transtibial amputation. Currently, prosthetists (clinicians)
subjectively align a prosthesis, and this may require several clinical visits. Subjective alignment relies on
prosthetists’ experience and visual inspection of walking, which is prone to errors and time consuming. Thus,
there is an urgent need to develop objective tools for prosthesis alignment. We aim to develop a novel method
to [assess] prosthesis alignment accurately, precisely, and cost-efficiently using wireless sensor technology,
which could improve quality of life and reduce secondary injury risk for the millions of prosthesis users in the
United States. The goal of this study is to determine the accuracy and precision of using wearable sensors
combined with an algorithm to assess prosthesis alignment in 10 Veterans with transtibial amputation.
 [We will ask 10 Veterans with transtibial amputation to walk on a force-treadmill at 1.25 m/s while they use
a prosthesis with neutral alignment and that varies by 3° and 6° in one of three planes, the sagittal, coronal,
and transverse planes, for a total of 13 prosthesis alignments. For each alignment condition, we will determine
the accuracy and precision of using inertial measurement units (IMUs) combined with a numerical algorithm
to estimate dynamic-to-static angle (DSA) of the prosthesis and the biological shank during walking in 10
Veterans with unilateral transtibial amputation (Aim 1), where DSA provides information regarding the
orientation of the prosthesis and the biological shank. We will also determine the accuracy and precision of
using IMUs combined with a numerical algorithm to estimate inter-limb symmetry indices of step length, step
frequency, and contact time, which are important discrete temporal-spatial parameters during walking in 10
Veterans with unilateral transtibial amputation (Aim 2). We will compare results estimated using IMUs with
results calculated using traditional gold-standard measurements of 3D motion capture and ground reaction
forces. We will also investigate the association between angular changes in prosthesis alignment and DSA
and interlimb symmetry indices (Aim 3).] We hypothesize that the IMU method will provide accurate (root-
mean squared error [RMSE]<6°) and precise (inter-class correlation coefficient [ICC]>0.75) estimations of
DSA for both legs and inter-limb symmetry indices (mean absolute percentage error [MAPE]<10%, ICC>0.75)
of temporal-spatial parameters. We also hypothesize that changes in prosthesis alignment will result in
significant differences in DSA using the IMU method and motion capture measurements. We hypothesize
that changes in prosthesis alignment will result in significant differences in interlimb symmetry index of step
length, step frequency, and ground contact time. [If our results suggest that the IMU method does not provide
accurate and precise estimations of DSA or symmetry indices, we will consider using a more sophisticated
prediction model (e.g. machine learning) to predict DSA using IMUs.]
 The outcome of our research is the development of a novel method that uses wireless IMU sensors to
[assess] prosthesis alignment accurately (comparable accuracy with camera-based motion capture system
and force plate ground reaction force system), quickly (within a single visit), and cost-efficiently (<$200). [We
also expect that this project will provide data to support a larger grant proposal to conduct a study that
investigates the relationship between prosthesis alignment and comfort level, walking symmetry, and
secondary injury risk in Veterans with amputations.] In the long term, the proposed IMU method could improve
the alignment process and thus maximize Veterans’ functional independence and quality of life, as well as
reduce secondary injury risk."
11140044,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Climate change is increasing the frequency, intensity, and human toll of extreme weather events such as
floods and hurricanes. Children living in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are particularly
vulnerable to the health impacts of these disasters because many live in areas that lack the resources to
mitigate, respond to, and recover from the devastation. Children might also be particularly sensitive to the
indirect health effects from disasters—morbidity and mortality due to compromised conditions such as
food security and clean water—as their health is more vulnerable to shocks. However, these indirect
effects are typically not included in the estimates of disaster deaths. Getting estimates of the indirect
burden of disasters on child health is therefore central for designing mitigation and adaptation strategies.
Recent evidence from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico suggests that indirect mortality impacts could far
outweigh the direct effects. In the proposed project we aim to improve measurement of the direct and
indirect child mortality burden of floods and storms (i.e., hurricanes, cyclones, and typhoons) in over 50
LMICs. These disaster types are particularly impacted by climate change and have a devastating human
toll. Specifically, we propose to (i) catalog the precise location and intensity of storms and floods in
Africa, Asia, and Latin America; (ii) link disaster events to child health records, (iii) estimate the impact
of these disasters on child mortality; and (iv) study the mechanisms and behaviors that contribute to
disaster related mortality, which will help inform mitigation strategies. This study will provide the first
wide-spanning empirical evidence of the indirect impacts of some of the most harmful disasters on child
health in LMICs. Our results will guide efforts to mitigate the consequences from these tragic events."

Proper skin restoration after the damage is vital for organismal survival. The lymphatic vascular system is spread
throughout the human body and has a critical function in mammalian physiology. In physiological conditions, its
main function is the regulation of tissue drainage, immunosurveillance, and regeneration. Lymphatic dysfunction
causes lymphedema a medical condition that manifests as tissue swelling and fibrosis. This serious condition
results in profound severe delays in wound repair and the formation of chronic non-healing wounds. The
mechanism by which lymphatic vessels regulate skin repair is unexplored. Additionally, while the role of
lymphatic vessels in immune cell egress from tissues is well-established, how lymphatic vessels may directly
modulate immune function in damaged tissues is poorly-defined. Recently, I discovered that lymphatic vessels
are actively remodeled during wound healing to form small capillaries which are present in close localization to
the wound front and hair follicles. This remodeling is critical for optimal repair as skin-specific loss of lymphatic
vessels results in a significant delay in wound closure accompanied by a massive infiltration of immune cells.
This proposal aims to leverage these observations by 1) delineating the mechanisms and consequences of
lymphatic vessel remodeling during skin repair, and 2) determining the role of lymphatic vessels and fluid
pressure in macrophage behavior during skin repair. This research stands to have a significant clinical impact
because it can serve as a basis for developing new therapeutic avenues for lymphedema ulcers and chronic
wound management. In addition, career-oriented guidance from my mentor and advisors, along with career
development activated during the K99 phase that includes formal coursework on grant writing and project
management, will further facilitate my transition to the R00 phase and my long-term productivity as an
independent academic investigator. Collectively, the proposed research and career development plans are
expected to generate data with a significant impact on understanding the repair and immunomodulatory functions
of lymphatic vessels in skin repair and setting the basis of my future research as an independent researcher."

This K99 application aims to determine biological and behavioral pathways by which maternal psychosocial
stress in pregnancy impacts risk for maternal and infant iron deficiency anemia (IDA). IDA is one of the most
common causes of anemia worldwide, and around 20% of women in the US experience a stressful life event
throughout their pregnancy. Due to the increased iron demands of pregnancy, pregnancy itself poses a
significant risk of IDA, especially for low-income and racially- and ethnically-minoritized women. IDA increases
the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes and can negatively impact the iron status of the neonate that may
cause irreversible harm to neurodevelopment. There is growing concern that oral vitamin supplementation
might not be enough to counteract the risks of IDA in the context of systemic inflammation, including
inflammation produced by chronic psychosocial stress and subsequent neuroendocrine dysregulation.
Maternal psychosocial stress has been associated with infant iron status previously, but the potential biological

11140698,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Every day, an estimated 3.9 billion people take medication to treat acute or chronic conditions. However, despite
the enormous utility of current pharmaceuticals, they are limited by several factors that prevent their more
effective and expanded use. Ideally, drugs would reach the desired concentration at the site of action for the
duration that the therapy is required. In practice, this is difficult because the body is constantly metabolizing and
excreting drugs, which necessitates re-administration. Depending on a drug’s therapeutic window and biological
half-life, frequent administration may be required, which lowers patients’ adherence to their dosing regimens.
This issue is pervasive with non-adherence rates as high as 50% for chronic diseases, leading to increased
morbidity and mortality and as much as $290 billion in added healthcare costs each year in the U.S. alone. The
field of pharmaceutics has developed formulation methods that reduce administration frequency, including
injectable controlled-release systems composed of drug embedded in biodegradable materials. Unfortunately,
current clinically-approved systems are limited in both the types of molecules that they can deliver and the drug
release kinetics they can achieve. This proposal seeks to develop parenteral drug delivery strategies that
enhance safety and efficacy, improve patient adherence, and enable the sustained release of biological drugs.
We hypothesize that emerging nanofabrication methods (e.g. multi-photon 3D printing) can be used to control
the structure—and thus behavior—of surface-eroding particles containing drug. Because the degradation of
these hydrophobic materials is confined to the surface, drug distributed homogeneously throughout their volume
will be released at a rate proportional to their erosion rate and exposed surface area. Using these methods, we
can model and rationally design microparticle structures that release drug at predictable, geometrically-defined
rates. Although this concept could be applied to achieve a wide array of release kinetics, we are most interested
in attaining zero-order release kinetics, which are desirable for most diseases, and sequential release, which
may be useful for dynamic conditions. Further, because surface eroding materials exclude water, their interior
microenvironment will remain dry and neutral, thus promoting the stability of encapsulated biologics at 37°C. The
features of surface-eroding microparticles run in stark contrast with existing FDA-approved microparticles
composed of bulk-degrading polymers that absorb water and produce acidic degradation products, which makes
it impossible to predict release kinetics a priori, contributes to the degradation of encapsulated biologics, and
prevents sequential release. The strategies we propose are only now possible due to the convergence of
advances in manufacturing and chemistry that allow us to exploit structure-function relationships at a scale small
enough to retain microparticle injectability. If successful, this approach has the ability to fundamentally change
how drugs are administered and improve patient outcomes across all of medicine."

Oral pathogenic biofilms are major drivers of major oral infectious diseases such as dental caries and denture
stomatitis. Currently, the annual cost of treatment of oral biofilm-related infectious diseases exceeds $81
billion only in the US. Strategies to control biofilm formation on dental biomaterials are needed. Biofilm
formation and adhesion are complex processes controlled by the interplay between physicochemical and
biological processes including microbial strain, environmental conditions, and biomaterial surface.
Specifically, biomaterial-biofilm interactions are controlled by different biomaterial surface properties including
wettability, charge density, stiffness, roughness, topography, and chemistry. Biomaterials in the oral cavity
are subjected to cyclic loading from masticatory and biomechanical movements. These repetitive forces can
have an effect in the biomaterial-biofilm interactions. In fact, our recent publications and preliminary results,
we showed for the first time, that the cyclic strain of the biomaterial surfaces is a parameter influencing the
virulence and dysbiosis of oral microbes (Candida albicans and multispecies biofilms), which can lead to the
progression of infection and disease such as denture stomatitis. The overarching goal of this proposal is to
mechanistically study the effect of biomaterials’ cyclic strain on the pathogenesis of oral microbes. In this
study, we will focus on the pathogenesis a fungal strain (Candida albicans) and denture-microbiota. Aim 1 will
study this effect using common materials used in dentures. Aim 2 will explore the phenomena with hard oral
mucosa and Aim 3 with an animal model. This project will help understand how the action of chewing is fueling
the progression of major oral infections such as denture stomatitis, which in turn could lead to the development
of methods for the prevention of pathogenic biofilm formation over implanted medical devices."
11137240,"Project Summary: Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is widely used to make inferences about pain processing
mechanisms, including how processing is disrupted in chronic pain. However, it is usually not possible to
separate nociceptive from pain sensitivity in these studies. For QST, this means that true, unbiased nociceptive
sensitivity cannot be measured using psychophysical techniques that have provided insight into other sensory
modalities. To overcome these challenges, we developed a method to selectively stimulate nociceptors by
locating fairly large (>2.56 cm2) naturally occurring areas of skin that are completely devoid of innocuous warm
fibers. By applying noxious heat to these warmth-insensitive regions, we are able to obtain unbiased measures
of nociceptive sensitivity and compare those with measures of pain sensitivity using the same stimuli (noxious
heat). Nociplastic pain, which is a different mechanistic category from nociceptive and neuropathic, is present in
many chronic pain conditions, including temporomandibular disorders (TMD). However, some patients likely
have more nociplastic mechanisms than others. To extend our knowledge of the mechanisms contributing to
nociplastic pain, this project will enroll both pain-free individuals and those with TMD and employ 1) standardized
QST procedures for assessment of nociplastic pain, multimodal sensory hypersensitivity, and comparison with
other chronic pain conditions like neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia, 2) a novel nociceptive-specific heating
(NoSH) protocol to measure the sensitivity of nociceptors in relation to the perception of pain, and 3) a variety of
endogenous pain-modulatory processes that might contribute to nociceptive and/or pain hypersensitivity in
patients with nociplastic pain. We hypothesize that a subset of TMD patients will display highly probable
nociplastic pain according to the clinical grading criteria. Based on preliminary data, we hypothesize that pain
hypersensitivity is related to suprathreshold mechanisms that modulate nociceptive signals differently in
nociplastic pain. Success in this project could also lead to development of a new clinical biomarker for assessing
nociception and pain in isolation."
11138146,"PROGRAM SUMMARY
The objective of our LAUNCH program is to continue our global health research training program called the
Global Health Equity Scholars (GHES) designed to create a new community of researchers, educators, and
professionals who are prepared to address new and emerging global health challenges. We will build on the last
nine years of this training program to create a cadre of new researchers who will dedicate their research careers
to address the health problems that arise out of the inequity of human conditions prevalent in informal human
settlements (also referred to as slums). Rather than addressing one disease at a time, we propose to provide a
comprehensive, multidisciplinary, and integrated approach to deal with urban and rural informal human
settlement health issues, developed over many years by the participating faculty members of this program. This
program will comprise four US partner institutions (Consortium)--Yale University, Stanford University, University
of Arizona, and University of California at Berkeley, each led by a leader in global health research with more
than 10 years of collaboration among themselves. Together, core faculty mentors from these institutions conduct
research at 25 institutions in 21 countries, representing regions of Africa, Central and South America, the
Caribbean, Asia, the Pacific, and Eastern Europe. The GHES program will address a wide range of health
research topics including HIV/AIDs, emerging and high- consequence infectiousdiseases, non-communicable
diseases (NCD), women's health, environmental health, mental health, interpersonal violence, substance abuse,
injuries, and the interaction of all of these health issues within the framework of slum health. Training will target
US postdoctoral fellows and pre-doctoral students and low and middle-income country (LMIC) postdoctoral
fellows. We plan to recruit 9-10 trainees/year with 60% of them as US postdoctoral fellows. The trainees will
spend 8-12-months at an LMIC site under the supervision of the Consortium and their collaborating LMIC
mentors. Workshops on global health research methods, skill building, and career development will be conducted
both in-person and online. LMIC trainees will spend 2-3 months at US institutions to undergo training in methods
not provided at their institutions. All of the trainees will be provided with research and career mentorship
throughout their training and tracked for career development after completion of their GHES-supported research
work. Thus, under this program, we expect the trainees to be exposed to one important theme in global health
research--health equity--through research that deals with health concerns of vulnerable populations residing in
informal human settlements and provide them with an opportunity to become experts in this new global health
discipline. The overall impact of this training program is, therefore, to create a new cadre of global health
researchers and leaders who address the emerging health issues arising out of ever-expanding informal human
settlements of LMICs."
11139375,"Grasping behaviors, which are essential for daily-life functions, are largely impaired in individuals with
cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). Although rehabilitative interventions have shown success in improving the ability
to grasp following injury their overall effects remain limited. The goals of this proposal are to examine the
contribution of physiological pathways to the control of grasping behaviors after cervical SCI, and to maximize
the recovery of grasping by using tailored non-invasive stimulation protocols with motor training. We propose to
study two basic grasping behaviors: a precision grip and a power grip. These behaviors are crucial because they
provide the basis for a number human prehensile manipulations and are also necessary skills for eating, writing,
dressing, and many other functions. Thus, our results may have a direct impact on the quality of life for veterans
and their caregivers by enhancing their independence and level of care.
 In Aim 1, we will investigate the contribution of corticospinal and brainstem pathways to the control of
hand muscles involved in precision and power grip after cervical SCI. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
will be used to examine transmission in corticospinal and intracortical pathways targeting finger muscles and an
acoustic startle stimulus with and without TMS will be used to examine the contribution from brainstem pathways.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to further assess changes in brain activity during
these hand motor tasks. In Aim 2, we propose to enhance the recovery of grasping by using novel tailored
protocols of non-invasive repetitive TMS targeting late indirect (I) descending volleys (iTMS) and an acoustic
startle stimuli. iTMS and startle will be used during precision and power grip movements in a task-dependent
manner to induce cortical and subcortical plasticity and enhance voluntary output of hand muscles (Aim 2a).
Later, iTMS and startle will be applied in a task-dependent manner during a motor training task that involves
precision and power grip (Aim 2b). These unique approaches aim at promoting neuroplasticity during functionally
relevant grasping movements has not been used before.
 The proposed experiments will provide new knowledge on mechanisms of grasping functions which will
be used to guide functionally-relevant plasticity-inducing protocols to enhance recovery of hand function. The
absence of well-accepted treatments for grasping motor impairments for veterans with cervical SCI and the
limited behavioral gains of present interventions underline the importance of these investigations."
11136655,"Project Summary
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infects over 250 million people worldwide and is a leading cause of liver
cirrhosis and cancer in many countries. The unique life cycle of HBV involves the generation of
covalently closed circular double stranded DNA (cccDNA) in the nucleus of an infected cell for
viral gene transcription and persistence. Current treatments only suppress viral replication. To
cure HBV, it will likely require a combination of drugs targeting the virus as well as boosting
antiviral immunity. In this project, we will apply the mRNA vaccine technology as a potent
vaccine and immunotherapy against HBV. A major scientific challenge is that the HBV vaccine
antigen, S, can disrupt protein homeostasis (proteostasis) leading to protein accumulation and
undesirable ER stress in the mammalian cells overexpressing the protein. We will investigate
the viral and cellular factors that hinder effective antigen expression, and improve the vaccine
antigens for elicitation of potent antibody and T cell responses to cure HBV infection. Success in
this project will also create new opportunities in the development of a multivalent mRNA vaccine
against common human pathogens."
11141324,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Plasticity occurs in the primary visual cortex (V1) in response to visual associative learning, where one
stimulus is paired with reward (CS+) and another is not (CS-). However, learning is not a unitary process, and
distinct stages of learning might drive contrasting plastic changes in V1. Indeed, previous work has found
dynamic changes in V1 pyramidal neuron activity and inputs at different times throughout learning. Experiments
separating distinct learning phases behaviorally are lacking, making it difficult to fully dissect V1 plasticity
changes throughout learning. To address this, we have designed a 3-phase associative learning task that
separates early, stimulus non-specific learning from late, stimulus-specific learning and reversal learning. We
will also manipulate stimulus value in two ways: devaluation and spout removal. Using this behavioral paradigm
along with 1- and 2-photon calcium imaging of the mouse dorsal cortex, we will test the following hypotheses: 1)
that visual associative learning differentially recruits V1 activity during distinct learning stages, 2) activity in V1 is
rapidly plastic in response to changes in stimulus value, 3) individual V1 neurons exhibit bidirectional plasticity
across learning, 4) visual associative learning changes cortico-cortical functional connectivity, and 5) V1 activity
is required to maintain these cortico-cortical functional connectivity changes. Our results will provide an
unprecedented level of insight into V1 plasticity throughout learning and stimulus value manipulation. We will,
for the first time, address how plasticity in V1 is mirrored across the dorsal cortex, or required for cortico-cortical
plasticity."
11042052,"There is a demand for estrogen-free contraception in order to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), particularly for obese women. A new long-acting formulation of levonorgestrel butanoate (LB) delivered by injection has been developed. Levonorgestrel (LNG) has a long history of clinical use in a variety of contraceptives (pills, intrauterine devices, and implants) and its efficacy and safety are well recognized.
The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a mission to develop safe and effective contraceptives for women, including obese women. Obesity is the number one public health issue facing the US population and is an independent risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Therefore, there is a public health need to develop effective contraception for obese woman that does not increase the risk of VTE. One Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved contraceptive method is the progestin-only pill (POP) or so-called ""mini pill,"" which is used mainly by lactating women only for several months and requires strict adherence to taking the POP at the same time every day. A long-acting injectable form of LB that is estrogen-free will provide a regimen that is easier to follow than a POP and have a theoretically lower risk of VTE especially for obese women. In order to provide preliminary evidence that LB could be effective for contraception, a clinical trial will be conducted in the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN).
The proposed study will be conducted in women of reproductive age in order to evaluate pharmacokinetics, the mechanisms of contraceptive efficacy, and safety of this new contraceptive. The enrolled subjects will receive LB via intramuscular and subcutaneous routes of injection. The Recruitment will include enrollment of approximately 50% of subjects with BMI >=32 kg/m2 but less than 40 kg/m2."
11141576,"Dr. Kirsch has been a VA RR&D research for 28 years, and a VA RR&D Research Career Scientist since
2007. He has a very active research program and is a leader in both rehabilitation research and academia. His
personal research activities focus on restoring shoulder, arm, and hand movements to individuals with
extensive paralysis due to spinal cord injury (SCI). SCI is a devastating condition that often causes significant
disability and loss of independence. Veterans are historically over-represented in the SCI population, and the
incidence of SCI in more recent military engagements remains high. As a result, the VA Rehabilitation
Research and Development Service has prioritized SCI research, and Dr. Kirsch’s research directly aligns with
this priority. His research specifically focuses on restoring arm/hand movement to individuals with high cervical
(C1-C4) SCI, a condition referred to as high tetraplegia, who have extensive paralysis below the neck. Such
individuals are typically dependent on others for most aspects of care and activities of daily living. Dr. Kirsch
has developed state-of-the-art (1) functional electrical stimulation (FES) systems for powering and coordinating
arm and hand movements in people with high tetraplegia, (2) human brain-computer interfaces that allow users
to intuitively command FES-powered arm movements, and (3) musculoskeletal models of the human shoulder
and elbow that are modified to reflect the specific characteristics of individuals with SCI or other disabilities,
and then used in simulation to explore the feasibility of an intervention (e.g., FES) and to optimize system
design for clinical deployment, substantially decreasing experimental trial-and-error. Dr. Kirsch’s research work
is well-funded, his publication record over the past five years has been very strong (quality and quantity), and
he is a sought-after speaker for seminars and conferences.
 Dr. Kirsch has also undertaken a number of leadership roles in rehabilitation research. He has been the

11143564,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents the most aggressive form of breast cancer, associated with poor prognosis and an overall survival lower than 5 years. Currently, targeted therapies for TNBC are lacking, necessitating the reliance on chemotherapy as the primary treatment strategy. Alarmingly, over 50% of patients display resistance to standard treatments, leading to the development of drug-resistant and metastatic tumors. Phosphorylation- dependent signaling is emerging as a key player in TNBC drug resistance, but current phosphoproteomic techniques fail in comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon. To address this need, we are developing an innovative phosphoproteomic approach that combines protein engineering and advanced mass spectrometry techniques for unbiased and in-depth phosphoproteomic analysis. SH2 and FHA domains naturally interact, with weak affinity, with cellular phosphotyrosine (pTyr) and phosphothreonine (pThr)-containing proteins, respectively. We recently engineered SH2 domains for ultra-sensitive and selective binding of pTyr-peptides and demonstrated unprecedented pTyr-proteome coverage. We hypothesize that the development of novel, highly sensitive pThr probes will unlock underexplored regions of the phosphoproteome, enabling a deeper understanding of drug resistance in TNBC. We propose two specific aims to (1) develop FHA domain superbinders for ultra-deep analysis of pThr-mediated signaling pathways, and (2) combine FHA domain superbinders with our engineered SH2 domains and conventional immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (TMAC, primarily recognizing pSer) for in-depth analysis of pThr, pTyr and pSer landscapes in drug- resistant TNBC. 
The novel FHA domain super-binders developed in this work will provide a useful tool for the scientific community and enable to advance our understanding of pThr-mediated signaling. Combination of FHA superbinders with engineered SH2 domain and TMAC chromatography will enable unprecedented analysis of the human phosphoproteome and will allow us to investigate in detail the mechanisms underlying drug resistance in TNBC, potentially identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets."
11135842,"SUMMARY
Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles secreted into the extracellular milieu by all cells in physiological and
pathological states. Exosomes can effectively mediate cell-cell communications, deliver macromolecules such
as proteins and nucleic acids to cells, and induce functional changes in recipient cells. Recent studies have
implicated that exosomes participate in a broad range of pathophysiological processes, including immune
regulation, organogenesis, and carcinogenesis. Despite great interest in exosomes for both diagnostics and
therapeutics applications, the basic understanding of the regulation of exosome secretion is not well established.
Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), defined as RNAs longer than 200nt without functional protein-coding capacity,
are emerging as regulators of gene expression and cellular functions. Our preliminary data has shown that
lncRNAs play regulatory roles in exosome biogenesis in both physiologic and cellular stress conditions, such as
hypoxia and oxidative stress. How the biogenesis, intracellular trafficking, and cargo soring of the exosomes are
regulated by lncRNAs is largely unknown. This project will investigate the role of cytoplasmic and nuclear
lncRNAs in exosome biogenesis and identify how they function in the docking, cargo sorting, and fusion of late
endosomes or multivesicular bodies to the plasma membrane.
The role of lncRNA in the regulation of signaling pathways and genes that regulate different aspects of exosome
biogenesis and exosome cargo selection will also be characterized. We will investigate how cellular stress
pathways, such as the HIF1-alpha and MAPK pathways, through lncRNA or independent of the lncRNAs,
influence exosome biogenesis and cargo selection.
Research accomplishments from this project will deepen our understanding of the basic biology of regulation of
exosome biogenesis and open new avenues for the therapeutic use of exosomes and lncRNAs in the treatment
of various diseases. Exosomes play a vital role in many biological processes, including adaptive immune
function, cancer metastasis, the development and differentiation of stem cells, tissue regeneration, and viral
replication. They also exhibit profiles specific to the cell of origin and therefore represent novel biomarkers that
show promise for improving disease diagnosis. Their central role in cell-to-cell communication presents
opportunities for the development of improved therapeutics. Therefore, it is essential to understand the role of
lncRNAs in regulating exosome production and release in order to realize these diagnostic and therapeutic
opportunities."
11163889,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The national comprehensive societal cost from alcohol-impaired crashes is estimated at over $348 billion, with
$296 billion attributable to ≥ .08 BAC cashes. In the last 10 years, the national alcohol impaired driving crash
fatality rate has increased by 23%. Young drivers are the most vulnerable group and at highest risk of being
seriously injured and/or killed in an alcohol impaired driving crash. Much of this vulnerability exists in the context
of young drivers navigating life at a time when individual freedom and mobility via driving is high as is exposure
and ease of access to alcohol and drugs. Prior to turning age 21, the Minimum Legal Drinking Age and Zero-
Tolerance laws (making it unlawful for those <21y/o who drive to have a BAC ≥.02) are in effect for youth and
young drivers with the intent of reducing harm and death due to negative consequences of alcohol use. However,
when a young driver who drinks turns 21y/o, they are no longer subject to key effective alcohol prevention/public
safety policies. Instead, when getting behind the wheel, they are subject to a BAC per se policy with a threshold
of ≥.08 g/dl. Unfortunately, this is a higher BAC limit with a well-established greater risk of serious injury and fatal
crash (i.e., BAC per se of ≥.02 before age 21 vs. a BAC per se of ≥ .08 upon turning age 21y/o).
 Given the current state of an increasing national alcohol crash fatality rate and high vulnerability of young adult
drivers, there is a critical need and salient opportunity to innovate policy focused in the young-impaired driver
domain. An early reduced risk exposure approach at the time young drivers turn 21y/o and can legally drink
could yield measurable harm and fatality reduction effects. Except for the state of Utah, where the BAC per se
policy is ≥.05, all US states are at a BAC per se of ≥.08. International studies prove reductions in BAC limits to
.05 significantly reduce alcohol-impaired traffic injuries and deaths. Using epidemiologic and system dynamics
methods, this study will provide a novel robust examination and modeling of a conceptual national age-based
Graduated-BAC per se policy (Grad-BAC) so that at the moment a young driver turns 21y/o through age 24y/o,
the BAC per se would be ≥.05. Thereafter, at age 25y/o, the BAC per se would be ≥.08 (except for Utah that is
already at a BAC per se of ≥.05). This study will first examine longitudinal pre/post-age 21y/o driving after drinking
behavior as well as state-/national-level crash fatalities specifically among drivers 21-24y/o by BAC levels.
Further, changes in fatal crash rates among drivers 21-24y/o pre- vs. post-BAC per se policy of ≥.05 in Utah and
in neighboring states will be evaluated. Next, national public survey and focus groups of state policy leaders will
be conducted to assess support for or against the Grad-BAC per se policy vs. a national BAC per se of ≥.05 for
all drivers ≥21y/o. Finally, the construction of a robust and comprehensive simulation system dynamics model
will facilitate the examination of potential effects of the Grad-BAC policy among 21-24y/o that drive after drinking.
This study will effectively leverage historical and recent landmark findings in impaired driving research and policy.
Study findings will prove to be highly novel and pivotal in informing new policy and prevention efforts."
11142252,"ABSTRACT
Membrane proteins are responsible for controlling the passage of nutrients, waste, energy and information in
and out of cells. They are critical players in physiology and key targets for pharmacological regulation, however,
we lack a fundamental understanding of why these proteins are thermodynamically stable in cell membranes.
Simply put, why does a greasy protein surface find its greasy protein partner in the greasy lipid bilayer to
assemble faithfully into its stable, native structure? In order to investigate this question, the Robertson laboratory
has developed a robust and rigorous model system to study equilibrium protein association in membranes based
on the reversible dimerization of the CLC-ec1 Cl-/H+ antiporter. Through the development of fluorescence and
single-molecule microscopy approaches, it is now possible to experimentally conduct a full thermodynamic
analysis of the CLC dimerization reaction in lipid bilayers, yielding the free energy of association (ΔG°) and free
energy changes (ΔΔG) due to mutations or different lipid conditions. Recent advances have allowed us to study
CLC equilibrium as a function of temperature, enabling a van't Hoff analysis to dissect the thermodynamic
changes in enthalpy (ΔH°) and entropy (ΔS°) upon dimerization. In addition, we have developed methods for
measuring equilibrium kinetics of CLC dimerization in a tractable manner - in the membrane and in real-time.
With this foundation in place, the Robertson lab is primed to build a full molecular model of CLC dimerization in
membranes. In the next phase of this project, we will investigate the hypothesis that CLC subunits are driven to
associate due to differential solvent dependent driving forces in the associated and dissociated states, and that
the transition state involves a critical solvation/de-solvation step. We will investigate this along three distinct
aims, by building a theoretical model of the CLC dimerization free energy in membranes using computational
approaches (Aim 1), connecting the CLC sequence and structure to dimerization through experimental
measurements of thermodynamics and kinetics (Aim 2), and developing a guest-host approach to experimentally
and theoretically quantify the impact of mixed lipid composition on protein association equilibria in membranes
(Aim 3). Throughout each of these studies, we integrate experiments and theory hand-in-hand, enabling us to
make robust connections between physical driving forces and molecular mechanisms. Regardless of the validity
of our hypothesis, our studies will provide meaningful quantitative information to the study of membrane proteins
in membranes. Ultimately, we expect that the results from these studies will provide a foundation for the field to
build new strategies for targeting membrane protein stability and mis-folding based on fundamental physical
principles."
11135806,"Secondary lymphoid organs including lymph nodes (LNs) are a major site for HIV-1 spread. Furthermore,
secondary lymphoid organs harbor viral reservoirs, which are a barrier to curing AIDS. Follicular helper T cells
and follicular dendritic cells in B cell follicles are well studied as viral reservoirs in LNs. Notably, in addition to B
cell follicles, T cell zones (TCZs) within LNs contain bona fide latent and persistent viral reservoirs in antiretroviral
therapy-suppressed HIV-1 patients. However, despite the potential of TCZs as a source of viral reservoirs, how
HIV-1 disseminates and how viral reservoirs are generated in TCZs are poorly understood. In this application,
we propose to determine the effect of TCZ fibroblastic reticular cells (TRCs) on HIV-1 and SIV spread and latency
establishment. We previously demonstrated that TRCs isolated from human LNs mediate trans-infection of HIV-
1 and that the interaction between hyaluronan (a polysaccharide) and CD44 plays a key role in this process.
Additionally, our preliminary experiments showed that TRCs render resting CD4+ T cells, the most abundant cell
group in TCZs, permissive to both productive and latent infection when the T cells are cocultured with TRCs prior
to infection. Therefore, it is possible that the interactions between resting CD4+ T cells and TRCs promote HIV-
1 spread by two mechanisms, i.e., enhancing of permissiveness to HIV-1 infection and mediating trans-infection.
However, it is unknown whether TRCs mediate trans-infection of HIV-1 through CD44-hyaluronan interactions
in vivo and how TRCs enhance the permissiveness of resting CD4+ T cells to productive and latent infection. We
will investigate whether TRCs isolated from rhesus macaque LNs mediate trans-infection of SIV via CD44-
hyaluronan interactions ex vivo. This investigation allows us to determine the extent of conservation of the trans-
infection mechanism described above and the usefulness of an in vivo SIV/rhesus macaque model for studies
of TRC-dependent HIV-1 spread in secondary lymphoid organs. Additionally, we will identify the TRC factors
that render resting CD4+ T cells permissive to HIV-1 infection and define the roles of TRCs in latency
establishment in TCZs. Completion of the proposed research establishes the basis for a mechanistic
understanding of the roles of TRCs in HIV dissemination and latency and could contribute to the development of
a strategy inhibiting latency establishment."

11137188,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In order to maintain the compact structure of chromatin yet ensure access and functionality when required,
eukaryotic genomes utilize multiunit chromatin remodeling complexes such as BAF, to enable dynamic binding
of transcription factors to DNA. Being so instrumental in genome regulation, it is not surprising that BAF-complex
genes are the most frequently affected by somatic mutations in cancer, in 20% of all patients and in 23% of
diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). However, the mechanism by which BAF promotes malignant
transformation and lymphomagenesis is unclear. Based on our initial analysis, the BAF complex seems to be an
important regulator of germinal center B cells, DLBCL cell-of-origin. We hypothesize that BAF enables chromatin
accessibility for factors involved in germinal center B cell differentiation and prevents activated B cells from
staying in the tumorigenic state of rapid cycling. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we will (Aim 1) define
the biological role and mechanism of action of BAF in the normal humoral immune response. To this aim, we will
use computational and experimental methods in genomics to determine BAF-complex composition, BAF
genomic binding and BAF-dependent changes in chromatin accessibility in primary germinal center B cells with
inactivating BAF mutations found in lymphoma patients. Furthermore, we will determine the role of BAF in
nucleosome mobility and positioning in germinal center cells using a novel computational approach. The Melnick
lab has discovered that regulation of nuclear architecture plays a critical role in germinal center B cell biology
and that perturbation of factors involved in nuclear topology leads to lymphoma. However, these factors, such
as the cohesin complex, are rarely mutated in lymphoma. By investigating changes in nuclear topology
associated with binding of the BAF-complex, we will test if this discrepancy is explained by BAF mutations that
might carry out these architectural functions. Furthermore, we will (Aim 2) determine the role of BAF in the
initiation and clonal evolution of lymphoma and other tumors through effects on chromatin plasticity. We
hypothesize that BAF complex exerts its function by globally inducing nucleosome mobility and exposing
transcription factor motifs. Once a mutation in a BAF subunit occurs and the general fluidity of nucleosomes is
lost, nucleosomes might be preferentially locked in an unfavorable chromatin position. This might lead to
stochastic activation of malignant programs. To address this question, we plan to expand our computational
approach to model changes in chromatin stiffness within cancers affected by BAF mutations using publicly
available data. Furthermore, we will establish a simple-to-use parallel single-cell transcriptome and chromatin
accessibility assay and apply it to lymphoma tumors from our BAF mutant mouse models. Taken together, the
proposed project will provide insights into the mechanism of BAF-mediated formation of lymphoma. In case our
findings support the hypothesis of BAF being the master regulator of tumor suppression in B cells, we will be
able to identify novel therapeutic targets for patients with BAF mutations and further classify those tumors."

Visceral adiposity is a key risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, owing to its role in promoting a chronic inflammatory state. While behavioral traits are a key driver for the accumulation of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), it is now well recognized that the microbiota is critically involved in regulating VAT development and remodeling. However, there is a gap in knowledge regarding the specific mechanisms underlying this process. We recently identified Clostridium immunis, a new human commensal bacterium, that reduces serum triglycerides, body weight, and VAT in mice, and we have purified and characterized an exopolysaccharide (EPS) secreted by C. immunis that recapitulates these activities. Moreover, we have demonstrated group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) and IL-22 are both critically required for C. immunis and its exopolysaccharide to protect against metabolic diseases. Collectively, our preliminary data establish that C. immunis is the first human commensal bacterium that negatively regulates the development of VAT in an immune-dependent manner. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanism by which C. immunis EPS decreases VAT. We hypothesize the C. immunis EPS results in decreased VAT by reducing ILC3-derived IL-22, thereby increasing energy expenditure. In the first Aim, we will analyze energy balance under a range of relevant environmental conditions. In the second Aim, we will determine the immunomodulatory effects of C. immunis EPS. Taken together, the proposed experiments will provide foundational insight into microbiome–immune–metabolism interactions. More broadly, these studies will highlight new microbiome-derived therapeutic opportunities for treating visceral adiposity and its associated complications."

Humans are ubiquitously exposed to metals and per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are either established or suspected 
neurotoxicants in experimental and population settings. Exposure to these chemicals can be particularly harmful in utero, a critical period of fetal 
brain development. Four major literature gaps exist: 1) prospective studies of in utero exposure to these chemicals and child risk of 
neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs) are limited in the U.S, with most studies from predominantly White, European populations; 2) despite 
growing evidence that these chemicals may affect multiple NDs and systems, most studies are limited to a single ND outcome without 
consideration of comorbidities; 3) exposures rarely occur in isolation, yet combined exposure across different chemical classes remain unclear 
let alone chemical-nutrition interplay (nutrition may modify chemical toxicities); 4) most children’s environmental health studies focus on 
identifying risk factors with few that use or develop solution-oriented analytic methods that can directly inform public health actions. To fill these 
critical gaps, Dr. Choi proposes to investigate nutritional modifiers that may mitigate relationships between chemicals (i.e., metals and PFAS) 
and NDs and generating policy-relevant effect estimates via simulating intervention effects on chemicals and nutrition. To address this 
overarching goal, she will leverage rich existing resources (biospecimen data and clinical diagnoses of NDs and comorbidities across the 
lifespan) in the Boston Birth Cohort, a large prospective birth cohort with a significant representation of understudied low-income minorities. In 
R00, Dr. Choi will utilize the newly assayed PFAS data on which she has conducted quality control assessments during the K99 to complete 
Aims 1-2. For the adverse chemical-ND relations identified in during the K99 phase, she will evaluate nutritional modifiers (Aim 1) and simulate 
intervention effects by estimating the number of NDs that could have been prevented had there been pregnancy interventions on chemicals, 
nutrition, and both chemicals and nutrition (Aim 2). This R00 will position Dr. Choi as an innovative, independent researcher in environmental 
epidemiology, with a unique niche in NDs and comorbidities, chemical-nutrition interplay, research translation, and advanced methods. Our 
findings and activities will increase public awareness and serve as scientific evidence for future policies on the environment or nutrition to reduce 
the burdens of NDs."
11080440,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Autism comprises a class of developmental disorders characterized by significant social, communication,
and behavioral challenges. Autism is thought to result from neural cell type imbalance during early
development, partly from the discovery of chromatin regulators as genes linked with autism. Yet, the
cellular, molecular, behavioral, and developmental mechanisms of these autism-linked genes are not well
known. This is underscored by the wide variation in type and severity of symptoms. Systematic dissection
of the roles of candidate histone modifier autism-linked genes is therefore fundamental to understanding
how mutations in these genes leads to cell type imbalances and altered behaviors, affecting physiological
well-being. We have taken advantage of the fast-developing vertebrate system zebrafish, in which histone
modifier genes are highly conserved, to identify behavioral and developmental phenotypes in mutants of
candidate autism-linked genes. By screening for behavioral phenotypes in zebrafish morphants, we have
prioritized 7 zebrafish lysine methyltransferase genes (corresponding to 5 human genes) for further study:
kmt2a, kmt2ca/b, kmt2e, setd1 a, and setd1 b. Despite their overlapping functions as H3K4 lysine
methyltransferases, mutations in these genes led to different behavioral phenotypes in morphants. The
full developmental and behavioral phenotypes, the cell types and circuits/pathways, and gene regulatory
functions that are affected in these mutants, remain unknown. The proposed study will combine
behavioral and developmental assays, pharmacological profiling, brain activity assays, and single-cell
transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiling to directly test the hypothesis that these genes function
to specify cell types required for cell type and circuit development and, ultimately, behavioral responses
during development. Altogether, findings from this study will uncover unique functional roles and
mechanisms for conserved candidate histone modifier autism-linked genes during early development."
11141966,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT 
Food insecurity is paradoxically associated with elevated risk of adolescent obesity in the United States. The 
mechanisms underlying this excess risk are not well understood, and such knowledge is essential for informing 
obesity prevention efforts for adolescents from under-resourced backgrounds. Thus, aligned with the need 
emphasized by the Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research to identify the reasons contributing to increased risk 
for obesity among economically marginalized populations, research is critically needed to elucidate modifiable 
mechanisms to target in obesity prevention efforts among food-insecure adolescents. In the proposed project, 
Dr. Hazzard, a registered dietitian and public health researcher, will examine binge eating as a potential 
mechanism to explain the association between food insecurity and elevated risk for adolescent obesity. The K99 
phase of this Pathway to Independence Award supported Dr. Hazzard in filling critical training gaps and 
conducting the research necessary to launch her career as an independent investigator conducting intervention 
work to promote food security and healthy weight among adolescents experiencing food insecurity. Through 
coursework, mentorship, and research, Dr. Hazzard gained expertise in (1) qualitative and mixed methods, (2) 
advanced statistical methods, with a focus on machine learning and causal mediation analysis, and (3) 
intervention design, development, and dissemination, with an emphasis on human-centered design. During the 
mentored K99 phase, she worked to elucidate the etiology of binge eating in the context of food insecurity during 
adolescence using a mixed-methods approach that involved (a) conducting qualitative interviews in foodinsecure adolescents who report binge eating and (b) leveraging existing data from an NIH-funded observational 
cohort to employ tree-based machine learning techniques. In the independent R00 phase, Dr. Hazzard will recruit 
175 adolescents into a new, independent cohort that she will follow for 18 months to quantify the extent to which 
binge eating mediates the longitudinal association between food insecurity and weight gain during adolescence 
(Aim 1 of the R00 phase). Finally, using a human-centered design approach, she will develop vignettes 
describing potential interventions in community settings to improve food security and prevent excess weight gain 
among food-insecure adolescents and assess perceived acceptability of the potential interventions using these 
vignettes in semi-structured interviews with adolescents who have experienced food insecurity (Aim 2 of the R00 
phase). Findings from this project will lay the groundwork for the development and implementation of an 
intervention in a community setting to promote food security and healthy weight among adolescents experiencing 
food insecurity and, in turn, promote Dr. Hazzard’s successful transition to an independent research career."
11167238,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy among women. It is a heterogeneous
syndrome with reproductive dysfunction of chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism, as well as metabolic
dysfunction: insulin resistance, glucose intolerance and metabolic syndrome. One such medication that may
improve both aspects of PCOS is inositol and it is available throughout the world as a dietary supplement.
More specifically we will study a combination of isomers, d-chiro and myo-inositol. The combination is thought
to improve insulin (and gonadotropin) signaling by restoring an imbalance in inositolglycans which are second
messengers in cell surface signaling. This project is the first adequately powered and designed double-blind
randomized clinical trial to test prospectively the effects of inositol supplementation in a double blind study (the
INSUPP PCOS study). We are conducting a four-armed study of inositol: Inositol at 1 gm, 2 gm, 3 gm bid vs.
placebo bid over a 3 month period in 108 women with PCOS. The purpose of this supplement is for us to
complete the total enrollment count of 108 women. We want to successfully complete this project in order to
reach our study goals and specific aims, which remain the same. Identify the effect of inositol supplementation
on serum testosterone levels during the study. Hypothesis 1 (Primary Outcome): Women with PCOS who
receive inositol supplementation will have a significantly greater reduction in serum total testosterone than
women on placebo, as well as our secondary markers of hyperandrogenism: SHBG and the free androgen
index."
11138179,"PROGRAM SUMMARY
The objective of our LAUNCH program is to continue our global health research training program called the
Global Health Equity Scholars (GHES) designed to create a new community of researchers, educators, and
professionals who are prepared to address new and emerging global health challenges. We will build on the last
nine years of this training program to create a cadre of new researchers who will dedicate their research careers
to address the health problems that arise out of the inequity of human conditions prevalent in informal human
settlements (slums). Rather than addressing one disease at a time, we propose to provide a comprehensive,
multidisciplinary, and integrated approach to deal with urban and rural informal human settlement health issues,
developed over many years by the participating faculty members of this program. This program will comprise
four US partner institutions (Consortium) - Yale University, Stanford University, University of Arizona, and
University of California at Berkeley, each led by a leader in global health research with more than 10 years of
collaboration among themselves. Together, core faculty mentors from these institutions conduct research at 25
institutions in 21 countries, representing regions of Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Asia, the
Pacific, and Eastern Europe. The GHES program will address a wide range of health research topics including
HIV/AIDs, emerging and high-consequence infectiousdiseases, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), women's
health, environmental health, mental health, interpersonal violence, substance abuse, injuries, and the
interaction of all of these health issues within the framework of slum health. Training will target US postdoctoral
fellows and pre-doctoral students and low and middle-income country (LMIC) postdoctoral fellows. We plan to
recruit 9-10 trainees/year with 60% of them as US postdoctoral fellows. The trainees will spend 10-12-months at
an LMIC site under the supervision of the Consortium and their collaborating LMIC mentors. Workshops on
global health research methods, skill development and career development will be conducted both in-person
and online. LMIC trainees will spend 2-3 months at US institutionsto undergo training in methods not provided
at their institutions. All of the trainees will be provided with research and career mentorship throughout their
training and tracked for career development after completion of their GHES-supported research work. Thus,
under this program, we expect the trainees to be exposed to one important theme in global health research -
health equity - through research that deals with health concerns of vulnerable populations residing in informal
human settlements and provide them with an opportunity to become experts in this new global health discipline.
The overall impact of this training program is, therefore, to create a new cadre of global health researchers and
leaders who address the emerging health issues arising out of ever-expanding informal human settlements of
LMICs."
11138810,"Families and unpaid caregivers provide the majority of assistance to older Americans living with limitations in
the U.S. Those living with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) experience progressive care
needs and often rely on multiple family caregivers who share responsibilities. Moreover, families have become
more complex in recent years – with more step ties, cohabitations, and voluntary kin versus legal or biological
ties –and populations with higher rates of ADRD may be at higher risk for having more complex family and
kinship ties. There are also concerns that norms about providing care may have weakened as a result.
 Although population-based aging surveys that are used to track the health and well-being of older adults
have broadened their measures of kin to include current stepfamily ties, none provide a comprehensive
assessment of family and kin ties from both current and past relationships or voluntary forms of kinship.
Moreover, older adults and their family members provide different vantage points for studying implications of
family and kinship ties for caregiving and these linkages may fundamentally differ for older adults living with
ADRD. Available resources do not allow a full understanding of the central question: under what circumstances
do complex family and kinship ties become activated and how does this process differ for individuals living with
ADRD? To address this question will require two innovations: 1) a shift in language to recognize family and
kinship ties including simple, complex, biological, legal, and voluntary kin (hereafter, “family and kinship ties”),
and 2) assessment of norms and care behavior that recognize both caregiver and care receiver perspectives.
Without a fuller understanding of these ties and dual perspectives, there remains a critical knowledge gap
about the landscape of family and kinship ties available to those living with ADRD, norms for those ties and the
actual care they provide, and linkages with unmet care needs in this population.
 The proposed training and research activities will allow me to transition to an independent researcher who
can address these gaps. Starting with Aim 1, I plan to: a) Gain knowledge about dementia caregiving and
ADRD assessment; b) Evaluate current measurement of complex family and kinship ties to older adults and
produce national estimates by ADRD status; and c) Examine, by ADRD status of the older adult, family and
kinship ties and care behaviors from caregiver and care recipient perspectives. Next, for Aim 2, I will: a)
Acquire formal survey methodology knowledge and skills through coursework, b) Conduct a scoping review of
the literature on family caregiving norms to older adults by ADRD status, c) Conduct focus groups with current
caregivers to older adults with or without ADRD to develop measures of family and kinship ties and caregiving
norms, and d) Conduct cognitive testing of survey items. Finally, for Aim 3, I will design, field, and analyze a
web survey with caregivers embedded in complex families about their kin ties, care norms, and care behaviors."
11138818,"Project Summary – Overall
 Bone marrow produces blood cells whose functions range from oxygen delivery to anti-microbial defense to
hemostasis, all originating from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). To sustain and regulate this process, bone
marrow stromal cells form multiple niche microenvironments, each tailored to the needs of a particular developing
blood cell population. Using highly-multiplexed imaging technologies, our proposed Bone Marrow Tissue
Mapping Center (TMC) aims to systematically and quantitatively dissect the cellular composition and spatial
organization of human bone marrow microenvironments. The resulting detailed maps will serve as an open and
global platform for understanding which cells and interactions are critical for each branch of hematopoietic
maturation, and how these vary by anatomical site and across diverse patient demographics.
 The TMC will define cellular identities and cell states at the transcriptional, translational, and post-
translational levels using Nanostring DSP, Multiplexed Ion Beam Imaging (MIBI), and MALDI-MSI, which
generate quantitative spatial maps of RNA, protein, and N-glycans, respectively. Our cross-disciplinary team not
only includes the inventors of MIBI and a pioneer of MALDI-MSI, but also experts in human HSCs and human
hematopoiesis and a practicing hematopathologist with expertise in histopathologic bone marrow diagnosis. To
overcome the unique challenges of working with hard, mineralized bone, we will leverage parallel, robust,
clinically-validated bone marrow processing pipelines which maximize and standardize sample quality and
compatibility with current and future technologies. Integrating seamlessly into standard clinical workflows, our
pipelines enable convenient sharing of prospectively-collected materials with the Tissue Core. Samples will be
collected from three different sources: (1) prospective, patient-matched multi-site collection from deceased
donors to examine differences between anatomical sites, (2) prospective collection of femoral head from hip
arthroplasty specimens for differences between age ranges, (3) iliac crest bone in the Stanford Pathology archive
for differences between races and genders. These multiple collection strategies, multiple sites, and different
investigational focuses complement prior HuBMAP projects. The Data Analysis Core team has pioneered
multiple novel data processing pipelines, including pixel-based analyses, cell-based analyses including state-of-
the-art cell segmentation and cell clustering and enumeration, and neighborhood analyses. These tools are
broadly-applicable to all highly-multiplexed quantitative imaging technologies. Overall, our team and strategy are
exceedingly well-suited for executing the vision of the proposed Bone Marrow TMC.
 The spatial structure of bone marrow reflects the evolutionary mechanisms that terraformed bone to create
unique microenvironments meeting the nutritional needs of developing blood cells with divergent functions. The
interdependence between bone marrow tissue structure and hematopoiesis is informative not just in blood cell
maturation, but for understanding metabolism, aging, and development of cellular therapies."

11060819,"2. ABSTRACT
The All Of Us Research Program (AOURP) is a historic effort to enable 21st century biomedical 
research that will benefit all persons in the USA. The inclusion of at least 1 million volunteers into 
one study is not only unprecedented in scale, but also sets new standards in reaching every
individual, regardless of race and ethnicity, age, geography, or health status. This will power 
genetic studies of health and well-being, which will eventually deliver more precise treatments 
and personalized medications. Already, early examples of this approach are apparent in the form 
of advanced cancer treatments and genetic therapies. Large and easily accessible datasets are 
essential to support the research needed for such breakthrough advances. In return, AOURP 
participants will have access to their genetic data, receive medically relevant personalized 
feedback, and gain insights into other aspects of their own personal health. A specific strength of 
the AOURP is the role of Regional Medical Centers (RMC), which provide their experienced staff 
and faculty, their resources, and their trusted relationships with patients and communities, to 
engage, enroll, and retain participants for the AOURP study. We have formed a consortium of such 
RMCs in the States of Florida, Georgia, and the Territory of Puerto Rico. We call this the SouthEast Enrollment Center (SEEC-2), led by University of Miami, University of Florida 
Gainesville, Morehouse School of Medicine, Emory University, and the University of Puerto Rico 
Comprehensive Cancer Center. These five prestigious academic regional medical centers are 
further allied with several public and private hospital systems and are working with dozens of 
regional partner organization to allow every individual in this geographic area access to the 
AOURP. Over the past five years, the SEEC team has registered more than 51,000 individuals 
and fully enrolled nearly 40,000 core participants into the AOURP study. At a closer look, 
these participants truly represent the diversity of people living in this region. More than 67% 
identify with a race or ethnicity that is historically not well represented in medical research 
studies, thus potentially missing out on the benefits of new treatments. Approximately 25% are of 
older age, and 18% have disabilities; together 93% of SEEC participants belong to the category 
of Underrepresented in Biomedical Research (UBR). More than 44% of SEEC enrolled 
participants have actively followed up with the Program after their initial enrollment activities.
The next phase, SEEC-2, will help push the national participant count to over 1 million AOURP 
individuals. We will more than double the above engagement and enrollment numbers, make 
AOURP a well-known mainstay in our communities, retain the majority of core participants, and 
foster the adoption of the researcher workbench. We plan to significantly expand our enrollment 
options and to implement novel activities, in order to make it easier for individuals to join AOURP. 
Examples include mobile enrollment with buses, partnerships with smaller hospital systems, and 
the development of regional networks of community organizations for outreach and engagement. 
We will expand digital and remote enrollment options for individuals unable to travel to our 
enrollment sites. Our community centered trained staff will use multiple measures of 
communication to keep participants engaged, including marketing, web and social media presence, 
phone calls, web calls, and assistance with ride share travel. Retention is already above 50% in 
several of the SEEC-2 regions. We will actively retain at least 55% of all SEEC participants, 
most of them UBR, by Year 5 of SEEC-2. The Southeastern region of the United States is home 
to a growing population of 36 million people, characterized by a rich history, a unique climate, and 
unmatched diversity. SEEC-2 investigators and institutions provide access to this diverse and 
distinctive population helping to achieve the overall goals of the national Program. With nearly six 
years of experience and a large, well-trained, and motivated team, SEEC-2 will continue our 
successful engagement, enrollment, and retention strategies in the coming five years."

11146794,"Generic orally inhaled drug products (OIDPs) are expected to reduce cost and thereby improve compliance with
prescribed dosage regimens, leading to improved control of multiple lung diseases such as asthma and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Despite these advantages, relatively few generic OIDPs have received
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and entered the marketplace due to challenges associated
with establishing bioequivalence of inhaled medications, largely related to difficulties in determining regional lung
dose. The objective of this study is to develop and validate new open-source computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) methods for a solution-based metered dose inhaler (MDI) product that can accurately predict regional
drug deposition throughout the airways, and then implement the model to establish in-vitro-in-vivo-correlations
(IVIVCs) between US FDA recommended in vitro test metrics and in vivo regional lung deposition. Innovations
in this project include first translating our existing methods and techniques to open-source CFD software
OpenFOAM. We will improve our existing MDI simulation routines to better capture the physics of MDI spray
plume formation and the evaporation of multicomponent droplets for a small-particle solution-based product
containing ethanol as a co-solvent. Concurrent in-house experiments will be used to broadly characterize the
MDI aerosol and will provide in vitro deposition data in realistic airway geometries to benchmark CFD predictions.
Our complete-airway simulation approach will be significantly expanded to improve model realism and enable
simulation of deposition during exhalation. Finally, the expanded open-source complete-airway model will be
compared with well-documented 2D and 3D validation data of the same MDI product evaluated in human
subjects with mild asthma. The developed and validated complete-airway model will then be implemented to
develop IVIVCs between the in vitro test metric of aerosol size distribution and regional lung deposition across
multiple subject sizes. To accomplish the project objective, the following aims are proposed:
Aim 1. Develop enhanced CFD open-source methods for predicting solution-based MDI aerosol formation,
transport and upper airway deposition and validate model predictions with existing and new in vitro data.
Aim 2. Develop enhanced CFD open-source methods for predicting solution-based MDI transport and
deposition throughout the lungs and validate model predictions with 2D and 3D in vivo data.
Aim 3. Implement the validated open-source complete-airway MDI model to develop IVIVC relationships
between FDA recommended in vitro test metrics and predicted regional lung deposition.
Outcomes. Project outcomes are directed toward an ultimate goal of increasing the number of generic inhaled
medications in the US marketplace and worldwide, which is expected to reduce consumer cost, improve
compliance with prescribed inhaled drug regimens and thereby improve quality of life and the control of multiple
lung diseases."
11145367,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Preterm birth affects 1 in 10 infants born in the United States, resulting in significant morbidity and economic cost.
Children who are born very preterm (VPT; gestational age<32 weeks) have increased risk for impaired
neurodevelopment. VPT infants experience increased physiologic stress while their caregivers experience
increased psychological distress-both are associated with impaired neurodevelopment. Epigenetic modifications
are proposed as a possible mechanism linking physiologic stress and neurodevelopment in VPT infants. The main
objective of the proposed research is to identify the mechanisms by which neonatal physiologic stress induces
epigenetic modifications that contribute to impaired neurodevelopment, as well as how caregiver distress
moderates the relationship between longitudinal neonatal physiologic stress and neurodevelopmental outcomes.
Specifically, the proposed research aims to (1) create and validate novel indices of neonatal physiologic stress in
VPT infants; (2) identify the effects of neonatal physiologic stress on epigenetic modifications and later
neurodevelopment in VPT infants; and (3) determine the effects of caregiver distress on neurodevelopment in VPT
infants. This aligns with the NICHD Strategic Plan 2020 scientific priority-to reduce the incidence of
neurodevelopmental disorders by improving the understanding of their origins in the developmental process and
identifying potential targets and optimal timing for intervention. During the K99 phase, the Pl's molecular genetic
expertise was further developed by adding training in epigenetic analyses via intensive workshops and laboratory
experiences, and the Pl's quantitative expertise was expanded to include complex longitudinal analyses.
Additionally, the Pl has gained exposure and knowledge of neonatal physiology via the neonatal hemodynamics
program at the University of Iowa, led by Drs. McNamara and Rios. Finally, the Pl has developed professional
development skills that will be critical for success as a tenure track assistant professor and independent clinical
scientist. The academic environment at the University of Iowa is well-suited for the proposed research. Faculty
members with expertise in advanced quantitative methods, epigenetics, and neonatal physiology are willing to
continue to provide expert mentorship to the Pl as a junior faculty member. The Division of Neonatology conducts
numerous research studies on preterm birth each year and has the infrastructure, including an outstanding team of
clinical research nurses and a high-risk infant follow-up clinic, to support the proposed research. The Iowa Institute
of Human Genetics provides researchers with a state-of-the-art, high-throughput genetic analysis facility and
supports research focused on human genetics Numerous institutional organizations provide a variety of
opportunities to develop the skills necessary for success as an independent clinical scientist."
11141974,"Advances in single-cell technologies have enabled three-dimensional (3D) genome structure profiling and 
simultaneous capture of the transcriptome and epigenome within a cell. Quantitative tools are, however, 
still unable to fully leverage the unprecedented resolution of single-cell high-throughput chromatin 
conformation (scHi-C) data and integrate it with other single-cell modalities. To address this challenge, I 
propose to (1) Develop a single-cell gene-body associating domain (scGAD) scoring system to explore 
single-cell 3D genomics data in units of genes. (2) Construct machine learning-based models to impute 
histone modification and 3D chromatin interaction for simultaneously profiling of each cell's epigenomic 
features and 3D chromatin architectures. Subsequently, I will develop an epigenomic regulatory score 
(ERS) model to infer the cell-type-specific promoter-enhancer regulation programs at the highest singlecell and single-gene resolution. (3) Validate and extend scGAD and ERS pipeline to CAR-T 
immunotherapy study to gain insights into the impact of distal gene regulation variations on patient 
responses. In Aim 1, preliminary analysis on human and mouse brain tissues demonstrated that scGAD 
extracts gene features agreeing well with the scRNA-seq data from the same system. As a result, scGAD 
facilitates the projection of cells from 3D genomics data onto reference panels constructed by scRNA-seq 
embeddings with known cell-type annotations. Hence, scGAD provides an unprecedentedly accessible 
and accurate cell type annotation method based on 3D chromatin architectures. Furthermore, the 
successful integration of cells from different modalities into the same network facilitates information sharing 
across 3D chromatin structures, the transcriptome, and the epigenome. Aim 2 leverages such multi-modal 
networks to build an ERS model. ERS jointly models the histone profiles at the promoter and distal 
neighborhoods of the target gene and the 3D spatial proximity between them. Therefore, the ERS scores 
quantify the regulatory effects of distal elements on a per gene and cell basis. Aim 3 will extend the 
integration framework in Aim 1 and 2 using scRNA-seq as a multi-modality bridge to CITE-seq data for a 
deeper annotation, especially for the Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells. This enables the in-depth 
investigation of the apheresis samples from the Acute Lymphoma Leukemia patients to gain insight into 
the roles of distal regulatory elements on gene expression and their impact on the CAR-T cell response."

The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is generating a vast multi-omic, multi-
tissue, multi-species dataset. With these data, the Consortium will better understand the molecular effects of
exercise. Managing and analyzing this multidimensional dataset present significant bioinformatics and data
management challenges and opportunities. The MoTrPAC Bioinformatics Center (BIC) at Stanford has been
actively working to address these challenges and develop solutions that will scale well beyond the scope of
the MoTrPAC project. Successes include developing clear data standards, cloud-based data pipelines, and
integrations with external bioinformatics resources. The BIC adopts a dual approach, simultaneously creating
& sharing innovative tools to enhance data usability, while also supporting the Consortium's critical tasks. For
the next phase of MoTrPAC, we propose three specific aims. Aim 1 expands the BIC’s data management and
processing framework, enhancing the existing system for efficient data management and processing. This
includes ongoing development of cloud-based pipelines, ensuring quality control and data integrity, expanding
the data management system for secure storage and seamless sharing, and adhering to FAIR principles
(Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Re-use). These efforts will improve research efficiency,
reproducibility, and collaboration within the Consortium, as well as provide novel bioinformatics tools to the
wider scientific community. Aim 2 builds on previous expertise to advance methods for analyzing multi-omic,
multi-tissue, and cross-species data. We will facilitate integrated analysis using best practices across various
analytic stages, including quality control, differential expression analysis, and multi-omic integration across
tissues and clinical data. Additionally, we will develop cloud-based tools and infrastructure for sharing analysis
techniques within the Consortium and with the scientific community. These approaches will uncover not only
scientific insights but also a reproducible framework for multi-omic data analysis. Aim 3 seeks to disseminate
MoTrPAC data widely through multiple resources and external integrations. We will maximize the usability of
the MoTrPAC data resource for the scientific community. We will continually improve motrpac-datahub.org,
integrating tools for data queries and visualization, and share data and metadata with both external
repositories and the NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE). Alongside these efforts, outreach, training,
documentation, workshops, and tutorials will be provided to enhance user engagement. These approaches
will ensure broad accessibility and long-term usability of MoTrPAC data. With our established expertise,
experience, and tools, the BIC is well-prepared to continue serving the Consortium and fulfill the vision of
MoTrPAC, to uncover the molecular underpinnings of the health benefits of exercise."
11175786,"Project Summary—Abstract
Healing following rotator cuff repair (RCR) remains a significant clinical challenge. While most patients report
improvements in clinical outcomes, approximately 20-30% experience a retear by 6 months. Failure of RCR
healing can lead to significant clinical consequences, initiating a pathologic progression associated with
worsening pain, function, and strength, and an increased risk of re-operation over time in some patients. However
critical knowledge gaps persist in our understanding of the significance of RCR healing, the roles of other patient
and surgical factors, and development of degenerative changes in determining longer-term clinical outcomes.
Our proposal addresses these gaps by leveraging two ongoing prospective RCR cohorts of 161 patients being
followed at our institution to collect comprehensive, and in some instances, first-of-kind data on shoulder pain
and function, RCR healing, and associated degenerative shoulder pathology over 5 years following RCR. Aim 1
will measure and describe the evolution of clinical outcomes and degenerative changes over 5y following RCR
using traditional and novel potentially more sensitive variables. Aim 2 will estimate the prognostic effect of 1y
RCR healing status on clinical outcomes and on the evolution of degenerative shoulder pathology over 5y
following RCR. Aim 3 will develop and provide online calculators for preoperative clinical prediction of 5y ASES
score under alternative healing scenarios.
The unique collection of longitudinal data on RCR healing and joint pathology in combination with clinical
outcomes will offer valuable insights into the progression and severity of declining clinical and pathologic
outcomes after RCR. This will enhance our understanding of the benefits of successful RCR healing and guide
clinical decisions regarding targeted strategies to improve RCR healing. The online calculators would have
immediate clinical impact by helping to identify and appropriately manage patients at risk for poor longer-term
outcomes, thus facilitating the use of strategies to improve healing where needed."

of the NLR inflammasome family that plays a central role in innate immunity, is induced by persistent DNA
damage, and that persistent DNA damage-induced NLRP12 improves the function of hematopoietic stem and
progenitor cells (HSPCs) in both mouse and human models of DNA repair deficiency and aging. These results
argue a protective role of NLRP12 in the context of immune response to persistent DNA damage under
conditions of DNA repair deficiency and aging.
 However, the mechanism underpinning the link between persistent DNA damage and NLRP12
expression in disease and aging has not been defined. To exploit this, we performed preliminary mechanistic
studies and found that persistent DNA damage induced abundant cytosolic dsDNA and consequently activation
of the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway in HSPCs from DNA
repair-deficient (Fanca-/-) and aged mice treated with ionizing radiation (IR) or the DNA cross-linker mitomycin C
(MMC). Concomitantly, a major transcription factor for Nlrp12, PU.1, was also elevated. We further showed that
inhibition of the cGAS-STING pathway PU.1 abolished persistent DNA damage-induced NLRP12 expression in
these damaged HSPCs, suggesting a potential link between the cGAS-STING pathway and persistent DNA
damage-induced NLRP12 expression. To further investigate this novel mechanistic link and its functional
implications, we generated a conditional Nlrp12 mouse model, with which we deleted the Nlrp12 gene specifically
in the hematopoietic lineages using the Vav1-Cre deleter strain. We observed exacerbated aging phenotypes in
Nlrp12-deficient Fanca-/- and aged mice, accompanied with the senescence associated secretory phenotype
(SASP) in the bone marrow (BM) and a significant increase in pyroptosis in BM HSPCs. Furthermore, deletion
of Nlrp12 significantly increased cytoplasmic localization of NLRP3, a hallmark of NLRP3 inflammasome
activation in the Nlrp12-deficient Fanca-/- and aged HSPCs. These preliminary studies suggest a novel interplay
between persistent DNA damage and immune response: cGAS-STING-mediated upregulation of NLRP12 as a
systemic pro-homeostatic effector of immune response to otherwise detrimental persistent DNA damage. We
hypothesize that persistent DNA damage activates a non-canonical cGAS-STING-PU.1 pathway to induce
the upregulation of NLRP12, which suppresses SASP to impede chronic inflammation and inhibits
NLRP3 inflammasome to prevent HSPC pyroptosis. The goals of the project are to investigate: (1) the
mechanisms linking persistent DNA damage to NLRP12 upregulation and (2) the functional links between
persistent DNA damage and upregulated NLRP12 in aging hematopoiesis."

This application is for an NHLBI R01 entitled “Indole Metabolites as Xenobiotic Danger Signals in Acute Lung
Injury.” I am a physician in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, and I am building
a research program focused on the studying the intersection of danger signals and host responses in epithelial
cells in the pathogenesis of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is an urgent public health problem
characterized by severe inflammatory lung injury with impaired gas exchange, a high mortality risk (up to 40%), and
long-term morbidity in survivors. Beyond supportive clinical care bundles that define the standard-of-care for ARDS,
there are few effective therapeutic strategies. Recent work has convincingly demonstrated that mortality in ARDS
and a larger group of patients at risk for ARDS is linked to excessive inflammation. However, the underlying
biological pathways driving these processes are only partially understood. Danger signals are proximal activators
of the innate immune system, and recognition of danger signals by the host initiate regulated cell death programs
and inflammatory pathways in lung epithelial cells. Danger signal activation of regulated cell death and
inflammation evolved to promote pathogen clearance, but these processes are deleterious and even fatal to the
host when activated in excess. In this proposal we describe novel danger signals to lung epithelial cells derived
from metabolites that function as Metabolism-Associated Molecular Patterns (MAMPs). Using high throughput
screens of metabolite libraries, we identified microbe-derived indole metabolites as novel danger signals that
activate regulated cell death pathways in lung epithelial cells. We show indole metabolites exacerbate LPS-
induced lung injury in vivo in mice, and in humans with ARDS we measured indole metabolites and found several
to be highly elevated compared to mechanically-ventilated patients without lung injury. In this proposal we will
investigate the following Aims: Aim 1: Determine the mechanism of indole metabolite-mediated cell death. We will
investigate indole metabolite toxicity to lung epithelial cells through CYP2F1/2-dependent biotransformation and
activation of inflammatory cell death programs. Aim 2: Determine the role of cAMP signaling in protecting from
indole metabolite cellular toxicity. We will validate key candidate genes identified through an RNAi screen and
repurposed drugs that augment cAMP signaling for protective effects against indole metabolite toxicity. Aim 3:
Determine ex-vivo toxicity of indole metabolites to human lungs and associations of indole metabolite levels with
hyperinflammatory respiratory failure and clinical outcomes. We will test indole metabolites in a human ex-vivo
lung perfusion platform and enroll patients in our Acute Lung Injury Registry to determine if indole metabolite levels
are associated with the hyperinflammatory respiratory failure subphenotype. This work will advance understanding
of the molecular inputs contributing to regulated cell death and innate immune activation in the lungs and provide a
new paradigm in lung injury – that metabolites are danger signals."
11175789,"Project Summary
During pregnancy and lactation, the female skeleton undergoes significant bone loss and bone microstructure
deteioration to provide calcium for fetal/infant growth. While weaning induces substantial bone recovery,
reproduction-induced bone loss is only partially recovered after weaning. Our objective in the last funding cycle
was to uncover protective mechanisms behind the lower fracture risk in women with histories of reproduction
and lactation. Using a rat model, we demonstrated that structural adaptation of the maternal skeleton during
pregnancy and lactation exerted a protective effect against estrogen deficiency-induced bone loss later in life.
Moreover, we discovered enhanced responsiveness to external loading in the rat maternal bone both during
lactation and later when subjected to estrogen deficiency by ovariectomy (OVX). During lactation, osteocytes
(Ocys) are known to actively remodel their surrounding matrix via perilacunar-canalicular remodeling (PLR).
Intriguingly, we also discovered enhanced Ocy PLR in the maternal bone post OVX, which appeared to be a
result of “memory” or reactivation of Ocys’ PLR response during lactation. The activated PLR during lactation
and post OVX leads to an enlarged lacunar-canalicular system (LCS) and an altered microenvironment of
Ocys. Using a multiscale poroelastic model of the LCS, we further demonstrated that the PLR-induced
alterations in the Ocy pericellular environment would amplify the mechanical and biochemical signal
transduction to Ocys, which could in turn enhance mechanical adaptation of maternal bone to maintain its
load-bearing function. These new and exciting findings provide a strong scientific premise for our central
hypothesis that Ocy PLR-mediated skeletal adaptation increases Ocys’ mechano-sensing, which in turn
enhances the mechano-response of maternal bone during lactation and post OVX. The objective of this
renewal continues to be defining maternal bone adaptation mechanisms during challenging physiological
events such as lactation and menopause. However, our focus advances from bone micro- and ultra-structural
mechanisms (in the last funding cycle) to cellular mechanisms behind maternal bone adaptation and skeletal
health (in this renewal). A cutting-edged imaging platform allows us to directly quantify mechano-sensitivity of
the Ocy network by measuring in situ Ca2+ oscillations in mechanically loaded bones. In the Aim 1, we will
establish the causal role of osteocyte PLR as an important mechanism to regulate bone mechano-sensitivity.
In the Aim 2, by employing osteocyte fate mapping in a mouse model, we will for the first time interrogate the
mechano-responses between osteocytes with and without exposure to prior lactation or lactation-associated
hormonal changes within the same bone. The proposed research project will define a novel and critical
function of ostecytes through PLR to regulate the balance between mineral resorption and mechanical integrity
of the maternal skeleton during challenging physiological events such as lactation and menopause."

The AU of Us Research Program is building a national biomedical research resource from an
historically diverse population to empower and accelerate the understanding, diagnosis, and
treatment of human diseases in a representative and equitable way. The Broad Institute of MIT
& Harvard has a 35 year track record of delivering on transformative projects in the field of
genomics. Beginning with the Human Genome Project in the 1990s, our center has played a
leadership role in the design, data generation, and methods development in almost every major
genomic resource initiative that the NIH has launched. Over the last two decades, Broad has
sequenced the genomes of over 630,000 people, with >290,000 of those being for participants of
All of Us. Similarly, we have genotyped - 1.8 million samples with - 180,000 of those being AoU
participants. Color Health's clinical programming brings improved risk assessment,
identification, and disease management directly to large populations. Color's genetic services
laboratory (Color Dx) has sequenced and retumed clinical results to >200,000 individuals, with
as many as 10,000 results in a single month's time.
Together Broad and Color propose to continue to serve as a genome center and clinical
validation laboratory for the All of Us Program. Our group has a proven track record of high
quality data generation, collaboration across the AoU ecosystem, scaled capacity for retum of
results, and driving innovation through a suite of pilots, demo, and driver projects. We propose to
leverage our economies of scale to allow the program to meet all its commitments and maximize
value while also delivering new and powerful data types into the hands of the scientific
community. We propose an aggressive cost reduction and cost sharing plan to meet these goals.
We further offer a vision, for a future where additional funding is available, to accelerate
the adoption of the All of Us cohort data by providing a diverse set of pilot and demo project
proposals across the spectrum from innovative multiomic data generation, to longitudinal
studies, to elucidation of the interplay between exposures a participant may have had to markers
in their genetic, epigenetic, or proteomic profiles.
Our group brings together expertise in management of large scale genomics projects,
novel assay development, interpretation of human variation, clinical validation, regulations,
information security, and scientific vision. We also bring our network of scientific colleagues and
collaborators for the analysis of expression, long read, and proteomic data and for future studies
to further elucidate the mechanisms of complex traits and genes x environment interactions.
Specifically, for this award we propose to support the core genomic assays of whole
genome sequencing and genotyping at the desired scales, utilizing the same validated, secure,
and compliant workflows we have used over the last 5 years. We further propose to complete the
suite of innovative multiomic assays we have started on a core set of participants. We further
propose a variety of pilot, demo and driver projects that could be prioritized for future adoption
should additional funding be sourced."

The All of Us Research Program is a landmark longitudinal cohort study that aims to enroll 1 million or 
more participants reflecting the diversity of the United States and create a unique biomedical data resource 
that can equitably advance precision medicine and improve health.
Since 2016, the All of Us New England Consortium (AoUNE) has contributed to the success of the national 
program by engaging, enrolling and retaining individuals in Eastern Massachusetts through a collaboration 
of Mass General Brigham (MGB), New England’s largest regional health system, and Boston Medical 
Center (BMC), the largest safety net hospital in the Northeast. In the process, we have designed and 
implemented robust procedures for participant retention strategies that leverage multimodal engage to retain 
strategies in diverse populations. To date, we have enrolled more than 37,000 Core participants of whom 
more than 79% come from communities underrepresented in biomedical research (UBR). We have
achieved high retention of our participant partners (PPs), including both passive (87%) and active (>40%) 
retention rates. 
Importantly, we have contributed to consortium-wide activities that have led to successful scientific 
contributions to retention. The AoUNE PIs have led task forces to construct the Social Determinants of 
Health (SDOH) survey and the Mental Health surveys, which each have strong and growing response rates. 
The AoUNE PIs are active participants in All of Us engagement activities as Engagement lead within the 
national program, and locally with our Community Advisory Panel (CAP). We are well poised to support 
the Division of Engagement and Outreach to achieve the NIH All of Us Area of Interest 1 to focus on: 
• Aim 1: Supporting existing participants and retention efforts with a focus on UBR
populations.
• Aim 2: Sustaining engagement efforts and disseminating research findings to participants
as a part of return of value.
We propose a process that will develop evidence-based solutions/models for scalable program wide-efforts 
to support the shift from enrollment to an engage to retain model for the All of Us Research Program."

11138858,"Project Summary
Metalloenzymes are ubiquitous throughout biology and implicated in a variety of human diseases. A gap in our
understanding of metalloenzymes lies in their maturation. Biogenesis intermediates precede formation of the
mature enzyme and must be tightly regulated to correctly assemble the metallocofactor in the active site. Despite
the wealth of knowledge on mature metalloenzymes, their biogenesis, especially active site assembly, is not well
understood. Photosystem II (PSII) is a light-driven oxidoreductase whose active site contains a metallocofactor
that is assembled through a series of step-wise ion binding and photooxidation events called photoactivation.
Photoactivation provides a convenient model for understanding metallocofactor assembly because it is facile; in
vitro assembly may be achieved by simply adding the required ions in solution and assembly is advanced by
providing light quanta. Furthermore, recent advances in structural investigation of PSII have developed a
platform for routinely solving high-resolution structures of PSII assembly intermediates. We propose to
characterize biogenesis intermediates of PSII that may reveal generalized rules for metalloenzyme assembly.
The long-term goals of this project are to provide structural and functional bases for assembly of the
metallocofactor in PSII (training phase), and reveal how PSII biogenesis intermediates maintain precursor
structures important for active site maintenance (independent phase). We will use structural approaches,
biochemical techniques, and computational modeling to achieve the following three specific objectives: (1) to
reveal how the oxygen evolving complex of PSII is assembled, (2) to uncover precursor structures of PSII that
are integral for assembling its active site, and (3) to understand the role of transiently-bound subunits during PSII
biogenesis. Gaining such insight may allow for the development of new therapeutics and design principles for
de novo metalloenzyme engineering."
11161652,"Ovarian cancer is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality that affects nearly 300,000 women worldwide
each year. Its poor outcomes relate to delayed diagnosis and development of resistance to conventional therapy
with carboplatin and paclitaxel. In the last SPORE cycle, we evaluated a novel inhibitor of salt-induced kinase 2
(SIK2) GRN-300 that enhances sensitivity to both carboplatin and paclitaxel. With the support of the SPORE,
we carried out a first-in-human phase IA/B trial to define the maximum tolerated dose of GRN-300 alone and in
combination with weekly paclitaxel. We also conducted preclinical studies to demonstrate that GRN-300
enhanced olaparib sensitivity in homologous recombination (HR)-proficient and deficient ovarian cancer cell lines
and xenografts. We have demonstrated that GRN-300 enhances olaparib sensitivity by 1) abolishing the class
IIa histone deacetylase 4/5/7-associated transcriptional activity of myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D), 2)
decreasing MEF2D binding to regulatory regions with high chromatin accessibility in DNA repair genes, and 3)
repressing critical gene expression in the DNA repair pathway. Whereas poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors
(PARPi) have played a large part in maintaining progression-free survival in patients with HR-deficient ovarian
cancers, the majority of patients will have resistance to PARPi and experience relapse. Moreover, combining
conventional or other targeted agents with PARPi has been limited by additive myelosuppression. To date, GRN-
300 has had no significant marrow toxicity in our phase I clinical trial. GRN-300 enhanced olaparib activity in
both olaparib-sensitive and acquired olaparib-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Cancer immunotherapy, including
immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), has shown great promise for cancers at multiple sites, but the frequency
and duration of response of ovarian cancer has been limited. Recent studies suggest that a deficiency in DNA
repair is associated with increased response of cancer cells to immunotherapy. We have found that GRN-300
increases phosphorylation of TBK1 and nuclear localization of IRF3 in murine ovarian cancer cells. Both TBK1
and IRF3 are downstream targets of the cGAS/STING pathway. GRN-300 or GRN-300 combined with olaparib
increases the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in human and murine ovarian cancer cells.
GRN-300 combined with anti-PD-L1 enhances CD8+ T-cell infiltration and antitumor activity in a syngeneic
ovarian cancer model. The goal of our project is to determine whether GRN-300 overcomes resistance to PARPi
and enhances PARPi sensitivity and whether GRN-300 promotes adaptive T-cell function and enhances immune
checkpoint therapy. We will pursue three aims: 1) to perform a phase IB trial of GRN-300 in combination with a
PARPi, 2) To determine the underlying mechanisms of olaparib resistance that can be overcome with the SIK2
inhibitor GRN-300 in combination with olaparib in ovarian cancer cell lines, xenografts and PDXs, and 3) To
identify the mechanism(s) by which the SIK2 inhibitor GRN-300 sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to ICB and
enhances T-cell cytotoxicity."

treatment considerably boost the survival chances of melanoma patients. Dermoscopy image-based 
melanoma diagnosis, noted for its precision and ease, is eagerly anticipated. However, despite AI-based 
diagnostic systems achieving accuracy levels comparable to human dermatologists, their broader 
application is hindered by concerns regarding privacy, legality, transparency, and interpretability. 
Addressing these issues to enhance the intelligence and reliability of smart diagnostic systems, 
particularly in offering interactive features, is imperative. 
 
The advent of large language models (LLMs), pre-trained on extensive textual data, presents potential 
solutions to these challenges. This research aims to establish an AI-assisted diagnosis system for 
dermoscopy image-based melanoma, combining high recognition accuracy with the interactive

medical training, creating a novel framework for interactive AI-assisted diagnostics using LLMs and 
marking a pioneering step in applying LLMs to dermoscopy image-based melanoma diagnosis. 
Aim 1 focuses on developing an AI-driven pipeline to automatically generate textual case descriptions 
from medical images. Aim 2 involves creating LLMs specialized in melanoma dermoscopy diagnosis. Aim 
3 aims to develop and validate AI-driven diagnostic assistants and virtual patients in medical educational

This R21/R33 proposal is submitted in response to PAR-20-133. The proposal focuses on the development of
an ingestible device termed “micro-pill”. The micro-pill will be designed to autonomously sample intestinal
content from predetermined anatomical sites in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, a process which currently
requires invasive methods. The development of the micro-pill benefits from the applicants' experimentation
with an earlier version of the pill that utilizes an osmotic pump for sampling. To ensure accurate sampling of GI
luminal content from specific anatomical sites, the micro-pill will be fitted with a miniaturized motor controlled
by pH and pO2 sensors. The concept takes advantage of the proximal-to-distal rising pH and falling oxygen
gradient, such that the micro-pill will sample autonomously based on pre-programmed pH and O2 thresholds.
This innovative control mechanism is optimal for this application because it dispenses with the need for
tomography or built-in camera that may be needed to track the pill's location for spatially selective sampling.
The new micro-pill will run on power from a coin cell battery and will also support wireless magnetic activation
in individuals where pH/pO2 levels may be altered due to atypical GI tract conditions. The architecture of the
micro-pill is optimized to enable sampling of viscous intestinal content and reduce leakage and contamination,
while maximizing the volume of sample collected and maintaining low specific weight for improved buoyancy
and motility through the GI tract.
During the R21 phase micro-pill prototypes will be built and tested in vitro in conditions simulating the viscosity
of the GI lumen and ex vivo in pig intestines. Optimized designs will be tested in live pigs. The R21 phase is
organized in 3 specific aims: (1), To design, fabricate and validate in vitro a motorized micro-pill; (2) To design,
integrate and test pH/pO2 sensors in vitro and ex vivo using electronics integrated in the micro-pill; (3) To test
the ingestible micro-pill in live pigs in vivo. The aims of the R33 phase are to assess the efficacy of the micro-
pill (4) and conducting a 2-phase randomized controlled cross-over diet trial in humans (5). In Specific aim 4
the feasibility of sampling human adults' luminal content from pre-determined GI tract regions will be tested in a
clinical trial. The trial will not only assess the micro-pill's function, but also compare the effects of a plant-based
and a meat-based diet on the GI tract microbiota collected from different anatomical GI sites.

The COVID-19 pandemic has rampantly affected the population of the world and created lasting effects on the
economy, health and psyche of the global community. Although it shares similarities with SARS-CoV-1, the full
extent of the pathophysiology caused by SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. In particular, extrapulmonary manifestations
effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly understood. Case series from China and Europe suggest that
the central nervous system is involved in the disease process in at least a subset of patients, with some reports
estimating up to 30% of COVID-19 patients having neurological symptoms, including seizure, intractable
headache, and impaired smell and taste. Although there are reports of neurological disease in in COVID-19
patients, it is unclear if SARS-CoV-2 invades the central nervous system (CNS). Studies of other
coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1, demonstrate clear neurotropism as well as neuroinflammation
associated with other members of this family of viruses. These studies raise the possibility that SARS-CoV-2
may cause neurological symptoms either through invasion of the CNS or through an increase in inflammatory
cytokines within the CNS. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 infections have neuroinvasive potential and lead
to altered and hyperinflammatory immune states within the CNS of infected individuals. We further hypothesize
that infection of the CNS exacerbates respiratory dysfunction through direct toxicity of ACE2 expressing
neurons that are critical regulators of cardiopulmonary function. Our investigations will combine the power of
human studies with those utilizing mouse models in which we can readily administer virus and assess for
pathophysiology. Aim 1, we will determine the CNS immune responses in COVID-19 patients with
neurological symptoms. Using a combination of single cell RNA-sequencing, cytokine profiling, viral
sequencing and antibody validations, we will fully dissect out the inflammatory responses within the CNS
compartment compared to the systemic circulation in COVID-19 patients. Using mouse models, in Aim 2, we
will investigate the encephalitic potential of SARS-CoV-2. Using several complementary approaches to
infect mice with SARS-CoV-2, we will introduce the virus into the central nervous system of mice. Using
depletion antibodies and various knockout mice, we will identify which immune cells are required for
neuropathology in these mice through survival studies, flow cytometry and immunofluorescent staining. Finally,
in Aim 3, we will evaluate the effects of CNS infection on respiratory outcomes. Because of the known
expression of ACE2 in the brainstem, and the brainstem’s critical role in regulating cardiopulmonary functions,
we suspect that CNS infection with SARS-CoV-2 will exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 respiratory disease.
These three aims will help support our hypotheses of how SARS-CoV-2 infections can affect the CNS and
respiratory compartments. We expect that our findings will uncover new strategies to treat patients diagnosed
with COVID-19 and help gain new insight to understanding the biology of SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology."

The objectives of this proposal are to (1) obtain the experimental skills and career training necessary to
develop a translational research program investigating mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle wasting and (2)
generate the data necessary to determine the feasibility of targeting senescent cells to restore muscle size and
function. Sarcopenia is a debilitating age-related skeletal muscle wasting syndrome associated with poor
quality of life and high health care utilization. The etiology of sarcopenia is not fully understood, and there are
currently no effective treatments. Identifying the processes mediating sarcopenia is critical for developing
pharmacologic therapies. Senescent cells accumulate with age and at the anatomical sites of disease. Thus,
they are regarded as a logical therapeutic target. Indeed, in mice, the targeted elimination of senescent cells
improves function and parameters of health in multiple tissues. Our preliminary data show (1) senescent post-
mitotic muscle fibers accumulate in sarcopenic mice, (2) the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is a critical
regulator of muscle fiber senescence, and (3) a subset of myonuclei within multi-nucleated muscle fibers are
uniquely vulnerable to senescence induction. I will use mouse models that allow for muscle fiber-specific
labeling and modulation of p21 to advance our understanding for muscle fiber senescence and examine the
direct contribution of senescence to muscle dysfunction. In Aim 1, I will overexpress p21 in muscle fibers in
vivo and apply well-validated markers of senescence together with transcriptome-wide analyses to determine
the core properties of muscle fiber senescence and identify regulatory processes that may serve as therapeutic
targets. In Aim 2, I will use gain-of-function and loss-of-function p21 models and assess measures of muscle
health, function, and size to determine the clinical relevance of senescent cell burden in skeletal muscle. In
Aim 3, I will use myonuclear identification and isolation techniques together multiomic profiling to examine
differences between senescent and non-senescent subsets of myonuclei to gain new insight into the factors
regulating myonuclear senescence. The K99 phase will be conducted at Mayo Clinic and will focus on
obtaining mentored training in methods required to complete the proposed aims. The R00 phase will be
conducted in my independent lab and will focus on analyzing mouse tissues and data, publishing findings, and
developing an R01 application based on these results. This proposal synergizes new skills in advanced
senescent cell identification, imaging, bioinformatics, and drug target discovery techniques to create a research
trajectory that is distinct from my mentors’ foci. This work will produce a robust foundation for an independent
research career elucidating cellular mechanisms of skeletal muscle dysfunction with the aim of translating
these findings into therapies to improve human health and well-being."

11161838,"Project Summary / Abstract
Urban children with asthma are at high risk for short sleep, due to an environment that jeopardizes sleep and
asthma management. Further, this group suffers from altered immune balance, a key biological process
contributing to individual differences in asthma morbidity and sleep health. Allergic asthma is a chronic
inflammatory disorder driven primarily by disturbed T helper 1 (Th1)/ 2 (Th2) cytokine balance marked by Th2
cytokine (IL-4, IL-5 and/or IL-13) predominance. Experimental findings in healthy adults show that shortened
sleep increases inflammatory cytokine (e.g., IL-6) and certain Th2 cytokine levels and that recovery sleep
following sleep restriction promotes a return to immune balance. Whether sleep duration plays a key role in
immune function and associated asthma activity in urban children with asthma remains a scientific gap. We will
use an experimental design that targets sleep duration, because (1) the urban environment and asthma
symptoms interact to shorten sleep, (2) sleep duration is a modifiable behavior overlooked in clinical care of
urban children with asthma, and (3) experimental data are critical to test a causal link for sleep duration as a
mechanism underlying immune balance and asthma.
 We will enroll urban children (N=204; ages 8-9 years) with persistent allergic asthma and adequate sleep
duration (9-11 h) who will complete a 4-week within-subjects protocol that includes 3 scheduled experimental
sleep conditions: (1) 1 week stabilized sleep (individualized; 9-11 h time in bed), (2) 1 week shortened sleep
(1.5 h decrease in time in bed), and (3) 2 weeks recovery sleep (1.5 h increase in time in bed). We will monitor
sleep duration (actigraphy) and lung function (home spirometry) daily and assess immune biomarkers weekly
and at the midpoint of shortened sleep. To control time-in-study effects, 1/3 of our sample will receive only the
stabilized sleep schedule across the 4-week protocol. In this project, we will study only urban children with
allergic asthma who obtain sufficient sleep (9-11 h, within national guidelines). Our shortened sleep protocol
will model the sleep loss that urban children with asthma can experience due to asthma and/or urban context.
Additionally, our recovery sleep protocol simulates a sleep optimization intervention following shortened sleep
in a well-controlled approach.
 The first aim of the study is to examine the effects of shortened sleep on immune balance [e.g., Th1
(Interferon-IFNγ)/Th2 (Interleukin-IL-4, IL-5, IL-13)R and plasma IL-6 levels]. The second aim involves
determining the effects of recovery sleep on immune balance. The third aim involves examining the extent to
which changes in immune balance are associated with changes in asthma-related lung function (changes in
FEV1) under conditions of shortened and recovery sleep. Results from this study ultimately will support the
development feasible, ecologically valid, and clinically meaningful interventions to optimize sleep duration,
immune balance, and asthma in this at-risk group."
11161865,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Guiding movements through space and establishing enduring memories based on such experiences is
essential for the survival of all animals including humans. This ability is thought to require storage of
memories, often in an allocentric (map-like) framework, and their conversion into a body-centered reference
frame, comprised of specific locomotor actions (e.g., turning right). These frameworks must be coordinated
in a fluid manner during navigation, involving both person-centered and person-independent information.
Impairments in accurate navigation are often a result of spatial disorientation, which can involve a general
loss of directional sense in allocentric coordinates (e.g., the goal is to the north) or deficits in determining
the location of objects or goals in relation to one’s body orientation in egocentric coordinates (e.g., the goal
is to my right). While the neural mechanism of these deficits may involve a distinct loss in specific spatial
reference frames, impairments may also reflect a loss in transformation across reference frames, such as
determining the appropriate action for an allocentric location and orientation (e.g., turning right when oriented
north at a specific location). The neurobiological basis of information processing in allocentric and action
reference frames is thought to involve a circuit, including the parietal cortex (PC), anterior thalamic nuclei
(ATN), retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and the hippocampus (HPC). The encoding observed in ATN, HPC and
PC has led to the notion that this network operates as a coordinate transformation system, enabling the
coordination of these reference frames for spatial memory, such as transforming a remembered allocentric
representation into the appropriate actions. While this is an attractive hypothesis, little is known about
whether such coordination between reference frames takes place and, if so, what the underlying circuit
dynamics are between the HPC, ATN and PC. These observations inspire our central hypothesis that the
HPC-ATN-PC network is critically involved in the coordination between spatial allocentric memories and an
appropriate action. Our proposal tests this hypothesis using a new task we developed in two aims directed
at: 1) Determining whether the HPC-PC circuit encodes map and action information, looking for evidence of
the computations underlying allocentric-egocentric transformations across the HPC-RSC-PC network, and
determining if the HPC-PC circuit is critical for generating an action dependent on spatial memory (i.e., map-
to-action). 2) Determining whether the ATN-PC circuit contains transformation information and is critical for
the transformation from a map to action. This proposal will provide critical insight into a hippocampal-
thalamo-cortical network that has received very little attention with respect to its role in spatial behavior. It
represents an important step toward building a complete understanding of the neurobiological bases of
dysfunctional spatial learning and memory, which occur in many psychiatric and neurodegenerative
disorders such as schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease."
11161935,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Obesity and eating disorders can present with uncontrolled and compulsive food seeking that is resistant
to negative consequences. The goal of this proposal is to understand how consequences of food seeking actions
are integrated into motivational neural circuits and describe how these circuits are modulated by homeostatic
state. The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are implicated in the control
of compulsive food seeking behavior. Aversive stimuli can impact the DA system to reduce food seeking, but the
impact of this stimuli is blunted when animals are hungry. Homeostatic circuits, like those downstream of agouti-
related peptide (AGRP) expressing neurons, dampen aversive stimuli by suppressing neural activity in the
parabrachial nucleus (PBN). The PBN provides input to the VTA, indicating that hunger may modulate the ability
of aversive stimuli to impact DA signaling and compulsive behavior. I hypothesize that AGRP neurons inhibit the
response of VTA projecting PBN neurons to aversive stimuli, leading to continued food seeking despite negative
consequences. To test this hypothesis, I will use in vivo neuroimaging of VTA projecting PBN neurons during
aversive stimuli and neurobehavioral analysis of compulsive operant food seeking behavior. In specific Aim 1, I
will use microendoscopic calcium imaging to resolve the neural activity of individual VTA projecting PBN neurons
during footshock, and I will determine how this neural activity changes following stimulation of AGRP neurons.
In specific Aim 2, I will test the necessity of the PBN to VTA circuit in punishment-induced suppression of food
seeking. Additionally, I will test whether activation of AGRP neuron terminals in the PBN is sufficient to increase
food seeking despite negative consequences. Together, these experiments inform on how negative
consequences impact food seeking and how this can be modulated by homeostatic circuits. Understanding this
interaction will provide a novel perspective on compulsive behavior and will identify mechanisms for how
compulsive behavior can develop in disease states where homeostatic circuits are disrupted. Through
completing this proposal, I will gain valuable skills in in vivo neuroimaging and build my expertise in the study of
operant food seeking behavior. These skills will complement my prior expertise, and significantly improve my
ability to address the neural control of food-seeking behavior in my career. These technical skills, along with the
training in research, mentoring, and professional development are necessary to support my success in pursuit
of a career as an independent scientist studying the neurobiology of feeding."
11130068,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early-stage dementia (ED) have a significant impact on elderly patients’
quality of life, healthcare utilization, and cost. Despite nationwide efforts for timely diagnosis of MCI and ED
(MCI-ED), more than 50% of patients remained underdiagnosed and undertreated. This is mostly due to
patients’ inability to recognize early symptoms, limited availability of biomarkers, and clinicians’ insufficient time
to assess patients for MCI-ED, particularly for patients admitted to the home healthcare (HHC) setting. This
K99/R00 will address barriers to early identification of MCI-ED via the development of an innovative algorithm
built on a combination of multiple data streams, including data extracted from electronic health records (EHRs)
and audio-recorded patient-clinician verbal communication during routine encounters. Our primary goal is to
utilize the routinely generated data in the HHC setting, including OASIS (Outcome and Assessment
Information Set - a federally required assessment of patients admitted to HHC), HHC nurses’ notes, and HHC
patient-nurse verbal communication to develop an MCI-ED screening algorithm. The long-term training goal is
for Dr. Zolnoori to become an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to
mitigating the burden of delayed care for patients with MCI-ED by developing low-cost, effective informatics
solutions. The solutions will take advantage of easily accessible data generated in clinical encounters and will
be built on novel data science methods, particularly speech analysis, the focus of her postdoctoral work. Using
exceptional resources available from Columbia University and the Visiting Nurse Service of New York, the K99
phase of this project will focus on gaining essential competencies and skills in theory and practice of speech
analysis and cognitive impairment to quantify properties of MCI-ED patients’ verbal communications in
interactions with HHC nurses. The R00 phase will focus on the development of a screening algorithm for the
early identification of MCI-ED. The specific aims are to 1) model MCI-ED patients’ verbal communications with
HHC nurses using an automated speech analysis system; 2) utilize existing natural language processing
algorithms to automatically identify MCI-ED related information, including i) clinical symptoms, ii) lifestyle risk
factors, and iii) communication deficits from both HHC clinical notes and patient-nurse verbal communication;
and 3) develop a sensitive screening algorithm to identify HHC patients with MCI-ED. To accomplish the
research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in speech analysis,
cognitive impairment, HHC services, biostatistics, and career development mentorship has been assembled.
This project is significant because this algorithm will be built on easily accessible data streams generated
during routine patient-nurse encounters. The algorithm has a strong potential to be integrated into HHC clinical
workflow to raise clinician’s attention to the patient’s cognitive functioning for further evaluation and
development of proper interventions to reduce the risk of negative outcomes."
11141485,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT:
Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a common and serious complication in youth with 2 diabetes (T2D).
Epidemiological data implicate puberty as a major accelerator of kidney injury in youth with obesity and
diabetes, yet the mechanisms by which reproductive maturation results in kidney disease remain unknown.
A better understanding of the pubertal mechanisms contributing to kidney disease is needed to promote
preservation of native kidney function, especially in high-risk youth with obesity and/or T2D.
We hypothesize that youth with obesity and/or T2D experience relative kidney hypoxia during puberty due to
a metabolic mismatch between increased renal energy expenditure and impaired substrate metabolism. In
turn, the kidney hypoxia results in loss of glomerular charge and size selectivity with increased
transglomerular transport of protein, and kidney dysfunction. To address these hypotheses, we propose to
design an accelerated longitudinal study in which we will enroll adolescents (8-14 years, 50% girls) with
obesity and elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c ≥6%) [n=60], and healthy normal weight controls [n=40] at
Tanner (pubertal) stages 1-4 and examine them at baseline, 1 and 2-year follow-up. We will combine state-of-
the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods for quantifying kidney growth, oxygen availability and
hemodynamic function with gold-standard measurements of glomerular filtration rate (iohexol clearance),
renal plasma flow (p-aminohippurate clearance), glomerular size and charge selectivity (dextran and
IgG/IgG4 clearance) and assessments of insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial function (intravenous glucose
tolerance test and metabolomics). These experiments are designed to define the mechanisms contributing to
kidney injury during puberty and identify novel risk factors and therapeutic targets to mitigate the
development of obesity and diabetes-related nephropathy."
11143328,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aging is a terminal process that affects all biological systems. Biological aging—in contrast to chronological
aging—occurs at different rates for different individuals. In humans, growing old comes with increased health
issues and mortality rates, yet some individuals live long and healthy lives, and others succumb earlier to
diseases and disorders. The concept of frailty is used to quantify this heterogeneity and is deﬁned as the state
of increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes. The frailty index (FI) is an invaluable and widely used tool
which outperforms other methods to quantify frailty. FIs have been adapted for use in mice using a variety of
both behavioral and physiological measures as index items. However, because conducting mouse FI requires
trained individuals for manual scoring, it often limits the scalability of the tool. Thus, although the FI is an
extremely useful tool for aging research, an increase in its scalability, reliability, and reproducibility through
automation would enhance its utility. We used machine learning applied to video data to create an automated
visual FI (vFI). The is easy to implement, unbiased, and scalable. Here we propose to improve our tool and carry
out an interventional study. We will adopt the vFI to function with genetically diverse mice (R61: Aim 1). We will
also create features from long-term monitoring to increase accuracy and breadth of systems measured in the
vFI (R61: Aim 2). Finally, we will apply the vFI to a diet intervention study to show its utility for large scale studies
(R33: Aim 3). We will test a high fat high sugar diet (increased frailty) and caloric restriction group (decreased
frailty) with normal chow (control) in a Diversity Outbred population of mice. The result of this project will be a
fully validated and automated vFI that can be used for high-throughput interventional studies, enabling
therapeutics for healthy aging."

11083259,"For debilitating neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), some drugs have been 
approved but only offer a modest attenuation of cognitive decline. There is a need to better understand the 
role of modifiable risk factors which could decrease the risk of AD and other types of dementia. The human 
gut microbiome–comprising of microbes and their associated genes–shows differences in composition 
between healthy individuals and those with AD dementia, and based on recent studies appears to be a 
promising modifiable risk factor. Despite encouraging findings, large gaps remain regarding our knowledge 
of the gut microbiome’s relationship with the aging brain and dementia pathology measured via 
neuroimaging, fluid biomarkers, and cognitive assessments. Fortunately, datasets that can enable this 
analysis are growing in terms of sample sizes, making a comprehensive machine-learning based 
investigation of these associations timely and potentially highly rewarding. To this end, our team proposes 
to make use of and extend contemporary developments in Transformer-based models that power 
advancements in large language model (LLM) technologies, and repurpose them into specialized models 
for these analyses for multi-modal datasets. The key components of this project include the following aims. 
Aim 1: We will design special Transformer-based models that will be trained using microbiome data via 
attaching novel trainable modules. These repurposed models will enable analysis of associations between 
gut microbiome composition and brain health in dementia. Aim 2: Our models will be extended to handle 
3D neuroimaging data with an eye on computational efficiency. The models will be rigorously evaluated on 
large imaging datasets as well as on multi-modal datasets. Their performance/generalization behavior will 
be profiled. Aim 3: The models will be used to study the relationship between the gut microbiome and the 
brain, anchored by eight specific scientific hypotheses. Pretrained models and software tools will be 
disseminated to the community. Significance: This project will yield sophisticated methods for multimodal 
analysis of microbiome, brain imaging and clinical/cognitive data for aging and Alzheimer’s disease. These 
tools will be disseminated and can be used to investigate a variety of scientific hypotheses to determine 
novel relationships between the microbiome and the brain. This in turn is expected to open new avenues 
for preventing and treating neurodegenerative disease and improve the health and well-being of aging 
Americans."
11081830,"Deep pressure touch can be pleasant and calming, although sometimes intense. It is often experienced in 
interpersonal touch, such as a hug, and is commonly used in manual therapy and massage to relieve 
musculoskeletal pain. Understanding the neuronal mechanisms underlying chronic musculoskeletal pain 
is a key health concern. Physical therapists commonly use deep pressure touch in their patients with 
musculoskeletal pain. Deep pressure touch activates different types of mechanoreceptors in skin, 
muscles, joints, and fascia. This project will investigate how deep pressure touch is encoded by peripheral 
neural afferents - to elucidate how individual subtypes respond to such manipulation, as well as how they 
work together as a population. The longer-term goal is to uncover correspondences with the encoding of 
tissue stiffness and tension, giving rise to musculoskeletal discomfort, including myofascial pain. The main 
objective of this project is to develop computational stimulus-response models of firing in 
mechanosensitive afferent subtypes to deep pressure touch in humans. In comparing model predictions to 
afferent firing, obtained via microneurography before and after soft tissue manipulation, or massage, this 
effort will seek to attribute changes to tissue mechanics and/or neuronal mechanisms. The proposed 
methods combine microneurography recordings from human peripheral nerves, bodily physiological 
responses, and perceptual judgments, with computational models of time-series relationships between 
tissue deformation and neural firing, as well as computer vision tracking of tissue deformation. 
Microneurography is highly informative about human peripheral nerve activity, but limited by the problem 
of sparse sampling, thus a computational approach is vital to fill in gaps at individual afferent subtype and 
population levels. This project focuses on recording from the peroneal nerve, which projects widely 
throughout the lower leg, in particular the front and lateral sides of the calf, and the upper foot, which are 
sites highly relevant to musculoskeletal pain. From a clinical standpoint, the anterior of the lower leg is 
implicated in shin splits, the lateral posterior of the lower leg is tied to sprained ankles, and the posterior of 
the foot and calf are tied to calf strain and Achilles tendinosis. These conditions are frequently addressed 
via soft tissue manipulation. Overall, the results of this work seek to uncover novel, fundamental insights 
into human somatosensation, and impact non-pharmaceutical treatment of musculoskeletal pain."

The goal of this application is to determine the role of estrogen and its receptors - estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1)
and G protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER1) – in regulating intraocular pressure (IOP) through
trabecular meshwork (TM) and Schlemm's canal (SC) endothelial cells. IOP is the primary and only modifiable
risk factor for patients affected with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) in the clinic. TM and SC modulate
majority of aqueous humor outflow resistance in the conventional pathway. Despite the significant research
progress in TM/SC outflow dynamics, limited therapeutic targets are available for modulating the conventional
outflow. It is necessary to identify novel targets to lower IOP more efficiently in glaucoma patients with
progressive visual field loss. Several recent genome-wide association studies have identified >150 IOP-
associated genomic loci, which is too many to follow up functionally. Our comprehensive bioinformatics
analyses of these IOP-associated genomic loci indicate the enrichment of ESR1-related gene networks
among these IOP genes. Factors related with menarche, menopause, and oophorectomy have been
associated with POAG. Genetic associations have been identified between sequence variants in estrogen
receptor pathway genes and POAG. Estrogen and ESR1-related pathways including aromatase may affect
the aqueous humor outflow facility and regulate IOP levels. The presence of estradiol in aqueous humor and
ESR1 protein in the TM/SC region further supports the potential role of estrogen and ESR1-related pathways
in IOP regulation. Based on our preliminary data on the elevated IOP levels from mouse models with the loss
of Esr1 or Gper1 as well as their interaction with Nos3, we hypothesize that activation of estrogen signaling
via ESR1 and GPER1 decreases IOP and POAG risk by modulating the turnover of extracellular matrix in the
TM and the NO signaling in the SC. We propose to determine the in vivo effects of loss of estrogen signaling
via Gper1 (Aim 1) or Esr1 (Aim 2) in murine eyes using tissue-specific knockout mice, and to determine the
underlying mechanisms of Gper1 and Esr1-mediated IOP regulation using in vitro primary cell culture models
(Aim3). Successful completion of this project will help reveal the critical role of estrogen signaling in aqueous
outflow pathway and identify novel therapeutic targets to reduce IOP more effectively for this sight-threatening
disease."
11167992,"While there have been numerous advances in computational methods aiding in rational drug design, most
approaches so far take a static view of the drug target, ignoring the complexities associated with the
dynamics and thermodynamics of conformational transitions. There is thus a pressing need for new
computational methods that are accurate, tractable and automatable for large scale drug discovery and
chemical biology studies that account for the changing nature of a generic drug target. Built on strong
theoretical and computational preliminary results, this program seeks to understand and guide design of
new inhibitors of tyrosine kinases and model riboswitches in a mechanistically guided paradigm.
Our research program is driven by the central hypotheses that (a) mechanistically aware ligand design
strategies can outperform traditional strategies guided only by structure, and (b) artificial intelligence (AI)-
integrated molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods can help learn mechanisms in a high-throughput
fashion. Our program can be split into two overarching yet complementary thematic areas. In the first area,
we will develop sampling algorithms at the interface of statistical mechanics, MD simulations and AI to
probe mechanisms for rare event processes, such as drug unbinding and conformational change.
Specifically we will build on our preliminary work in using ideas from neural information processing and
natural language processing, and adapt them for advanced sampling methods that learn reaction coordinate,
thermodynamics and kinetics on-the-fly as the simulation progresses. In addition, we will also be interacting
closely with other leading computational groups to integrate our sampling methods with theirs and to
facilitate efficient, accurate sampling for polarizable force-field development. In the second area, we will
use our algorithms to guide mechanistically driven design of inhibitors of Src, Abl kinases and PreQ1
riboswitches. We will take a mechanistically driven perspective wherein we will map out the different
conformations of a given target and understand how an existing ligand interacts with these, and then propose
ligand modifications based upon this understanding. We will use our AI-augmented MD methods to
understand the dissociation mechanisms of ligands in one uninterrupted “atoms to mechanism” workflow
with minimal human intervention. All our predictions will be validated in different ways by our

There is an epidemic of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Central America, and the prevalence has been
increasing over the past 20 years. El Salvador and Nicaragua have the highest overall mortality rates from kidney
disease in the world, and CKD is the second leading cause of mortality among men of working age. In the US
and Europe, CKD is common in older populations (age>60), affects men and women equally, and is primarily
due to diabetes and hypertension. In contrast, CKD in certain regions of Central America disproportionately
affects younger men and appears to be unrelated to diabetes or hypertension. Agricultural workers are the most
affected, but the specific cause(s) remains unknown. Similar epidemics of chronic kidney disease of unknown
etiology (CKDu) exist in Sri Lanka and India. The US National Institutes of Health is establishing a research
consortium that will bring together a broad range of expertise and enable discovery science to understand the
cause or causes of CKDu and disease progression. The Consortium will also work to identify potential therapeutic
targets and public health intervention and will consist of a Scientific Data Coordinating Center, Field
Epidemiology Sites, and a Renal Science Core. The Consortium will work together to finalize ethical
epidemiology research designs, execute common strategies for biological sampling and environmental
assessment, apply analytic strategies for collected samples and data, and disseminate results. This is a proposal
for a Field Epidemiology Site in El Salvador and Nicaragua.
Our aims are: (1) Develop study protocol with the CURE Consortium Steering Committee and SDCC to conduct
longitudinal research on the causes and progression of CKDu; (2) Engage and consent up to 880 Salvadoran
and Nicaraguan participants residing in well-documented high-risk CKDu communities into the CURE
Consortium; (3) Conduct clinical assessments, collect biological and environmental samples, and administer
questionnaires to determine disease status and risk factors for the examination of multiple hypotheses
longitudinally for three years; (4) Engage in multi-directional and sustained communication among investigators
and stakeholders locally and internationally, including communicating individual kidney function results to CURE
participants, and overall study results to cohort participants, local partners, the scientific community, public health
officials, and the general public. Our study team currently has a strong history together on this topic.

Regular physical activity induces specific adaptive responses in various tissues, and ultimately improves health
and reduces the risk for cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. To improve the efficacy of physical activity,
many studies have examined the impacts of intensity, duration, frequency, and modality of physical activity on
the adaptive responses. However, timing of physical activity has been rarely considered. It is well-established
that the circadian timing system modulates cardiovascular function and metabolism, generating ~24-h rhythms
in these physiological functions that are in synchrony with the day-night cycle. Thus, physical activity at different
times of day may have different impacts on health due to the circadian control. Indeed, recent breakthrough
animal studies have shown time-of-day dependent effects of exercise on transcripts and metabolites enriched in
metabolic pathways that are related to exercise adaptations and, importantly, linked to the circadian system. We
hypothesize that timing of physical activity modulates the adaptive responses, and can thus be used to enhance
physical activity-induced health benefits. To address this hypothesis, during the K99 phase, I will first utilize the
dataset from an NIH-funded randomized controlled trial with lifestyle intervention and 1-week accelerometer
recording among approximately 2,200 patients with type 2 diabetes to examine 1) the association between timing
of physical activity and markers of cardiometabolic health at baseline, and 2) the association between timing of
physical activity and the improvements in markers of cardiometabolic health at 1-year follow-up. In the R00
phase, I will test the causal relationship by experimentally manipulating the timing of physical activity in
individuals with prediabetes using a randomized, cross-over design with two highly controlled in-laboratory
protocols. This innovative project will advance our knowledge in the interaction effects of the circadian timing
system and physical activity and may help in designing evidence-based lifestyle interventions incorporating
timing of physical activity. I am well suited to perform this research based on 1) my expertise in chronobiology,
physiology, and human experimental research; 2) the exceptional multi-disciplinary mentoring team comprised
of leaders in their respective fields; and 3) the unparalleled research environment to support my career
development. Through this study, I will further my training in circadian physiology, as well as expand my expertise
in exercise physiology, epidemiology, and clinical trial design. The proposed research and training will help
achieve my long-term goal of launching an independent research program dedicated to understanding the
interaction of the circadian system and physical activity from observational towards experimental study design.
The findings of this research have the potential to frame the basic strategy and recommendation of
chronobiology-based exercise interventions."

This Task Order is for the conduct of a Phase I clinical trial to test whether Dimethandrolone undecanoate will be well tolerated and will suppress gonadotropins. Preliminary results from animal studies indicate that an oral or an intramuscular dose of the drug has both progestin and androgen activity and will suppress gonadotropins sufficiently to a level that produces inhibition of spermatogenesis. Delivery of the dose intramuscularly may have long acting effectiveness. Since this study is first in man IM delivery, it is not known what dose of drug will be effective at suppression of gonadotropins or if the drug will be well tolerated. The study will test a single dose of drug in men and will continue with single doses of escalating strength assuming that the drug is well tolerated. The primary outcome will be to measure suppression of gonadotropins over the treatment period and to collect information about possible side effects.

The objective of the trial is to determine, in a Phase I clinical trial, whether intramuscular doses
of a new chemical entity, Dimethandrolone undecanoate, will be well tolerated in a single dose escalation study. Results from the Phase I trial will establish if the agents could be evaluated in a longer-term sperm suppression clinical trial, pursuant to obtaining FDA approval as a contraceptive. Therefore, the objective of this Task Order is to conduct the study so that the overall objectives of the Phase I clinical trial are successfully achieved."

 The COVID-19 pandemic has had sweeping effects on pregnant women and their
partners. The need to adhere to social distancing guidelines has altered the social
connectedness of expectant parents, with effects on stress, loneliness, reduced access to in-
person prenatal care, and childbirth support. Social support during pregnancy is known to
buffer stress and predict better postpartum outcomes for both new parents and their infants.
For example, greater prenatal support has been linked with decreased risk of parental
postpartum mood and anxiety disorders, lower incidence of preterm birth and low birth
weight, calmer infant temperament, and healthier infant development. Given this evidence,
pandemic-induced changes to social connectedness during pregnancy may have long-term
effects for new parents and their children.
 The current proposal leverages the unique natural experiment of the COVID-19
pandemic to examine the maternal and infant health effects of social connectedness among
pregnant women and their partners. The CHIRP (Coronavirus, Health, Isolation and
Resilience in Pregnancy) study launched in spring 2020 and has enrolled 710 expectant
parents who reported on their feelings of social connectedness and support during
pregnancy. We will follow up with this cohort three, six, and 12 months after the birth of their
child. In addition to collecting self-report data, we will gather hospital birth charts to measure
gestational outcomes, and hair cortisol to measure neuroendocrine stress exposure. We also
plan to use geocoding to model the social, economic, and health impacts of the pandemic
and explore how these impacts shape postpartum outcomes. Our lab has already collected
data from another cohort of 200 expectant parents recruited during pregnancy and followed
over the transition to parenthood, constituting a pre-pandemic comparison sample with the
same measures and timing. We will also conduct a five-year follow-up with children from our
pre-pandemic dataset that will incorporate behavioral and neuroimaging measures of
neurodevelopment.
 Our pilot data indicates significantly higher ratings of psychological distress and lower
ratings of social support among expectant parents affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We
expect that this project will make important contributions to the study of stress and resilience
during pregnancy and its long-term effects on both maternal and infant well-being."
11175767,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In this proposal, we will quantify disparities in incidence, short- and long-term outcomes, and barriers to post-
partum care in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) according to various demographic
factors and socioeconomic (SES) status indicators. HDP includes a broad spectrum of subtypes associated
with varying degrees of morbidity. Incidence of HDP and its complications are higher in rural areas and
socioeconomic status (SES) likely plays a moderating effect, but this has not been well-studied due to
challenges in determining individual-level SES. Our overall goal is to develop targeted strategies to improve
the cardiovascular health of women after HDP. This proposal strongly aligns with Goal 1 of the 2019-2023
Trans-NIH Strategic Plan for Women's Health Research ""Advancing Science for the Health of Women”, which
aims to understand chronic conditions understudied among women and/or that disproportionately affect
populations of women who are understudied, underrepresented, and underreported in biomedical research –
specifically, women in rural areas and women who have low SES. We will use a novel indicator of SES, the
HOUsing-based Socioeconomic Status (HOUSES) index, which is an objective, scalable, standardized, and
individual-level SES measure that predicts multiple health outcomes. Our hypothesis is that SES may be an
important modifier of risk, with low SES causing a multiplicative increase in HDP incidence and outcomes,
regardless of place of residence.The following 3 aims are proposed to understand the intersection between
rural residence and SES in HDP. The first aim is to determine if SES is a significant moderator in the
relationship between urban/rural status and the incidence of HDP and its subtypes. We will quantify the
incidence of HDP subtypes in a 27-county region of the Upper Midwest, which has a large rural population,
using electronic health record data from 2000 to 2021 and test for interactions between urban/rural status and
SES. The second aim is to determine if SES is a significant moderator in the association between urban/rural
status and the risk of short and long-term complications of HDP. Using HDP cases identified in the first aim, we
will identify any cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diagnoses that develop after delivery and characterize
acute care and post-partum visits in the first year after delivery. We will test for interaction between rural/urban
status and SES and conduct a comprehensive cost analysis. The third aim will be to assess key barriers to
care for high-risk women with HDP complications through qualitative semi-structured interviews. We will
interview 30 demographically diverse women with adverse outcomes after HDP using the Health Belief Model
to understand barriers and facilitators of access to post-partum care. By combining the results of this
qualitative aim with the results from Aim 1 and 2, we can develop effective interventions that target high-risk
populations in rural areas and improve the care of women with HDP in the reproductive era and beyond."
11175775,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Food insecurity is a toxic stressor in the context of forced migration, which increases health risk and
contributes to health disparities. The proposed study will capitalize on the expertise, previous work, cultural
backgrounds, and community liaisons of leading scientists in migrant health, health disparities, and nutrition to
conduct the first prospective, longitudinal study to use a biobehavioral approach to characterize food insecurity
as a social determinant of health in a marginalized immigrant population about which little is known. In this
study, our team will collect longitudinal, mixed methods data from 450 Latino immigrants varying in migration
context to examine how exposure to food insecurity and trauma – concurrently and prospectively influence risk
for CVD and diminished psychological well-being via the biological pathways of malnutrition and systemic
inflammation. Importantly, the proposed study will also identify individual and cultural factors that might
ameliorate the detrimental health effects of food insecurity on CVD risk and psychological well-being among
marginalized Latino immigrants. In collaboration with established community partners, participants will be
recruited from immigrant camps/shelters on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, along with a
control/comparison group of established Latino immigrants living in the U.S. (≥ 5 years in U.S.). Using the
inflammatory hypothesis of chronic stress as a conceptual framework, the proposed study incorporates state-
of-the-art biological markers and mixed methods to provide novel information about biobehavioral mechanisms
that underlie health risk and foster resilience across domains and levels. Specific aim 1 is to characterize the
food insecurity patterns of Latino immigrants varying in history of trauma and migration context. Specific aim 2
is to characterize the concurrent and prospective relationships between food insecurity, nutritional status,
inflammation, CVD risk, and psychological well-being, and to identify disparities in these associations among
Latino immigrants varying in history of trauma and migration context. Specific aim 3 is to identify and
understand sociocultural and personal factors that moderate the associations between nutritional status,
inflammation, CVD risk, and psychological well-being among Latino immigrants varying in history of trauma
and migration context. Knowledge gained from the proposed study will (1) fill a gap in the literature and propel
scientific evidence about biobehavioral mechanisms through which food insecurity influences cardiovascular
health and psychological well-being among Latino immigrants, while accounting for differences in the
immigration experience that underlie health disparities in this immigrant population; (2) inform culture and
context sensitive assessments, prevention efforts, and intervention to address food insecurity and its
detrimental health effects; and (3) guide advocacy and policy to address food insecurity among a marginalized
and vulnerable immigrant population."
11175772,"Hemolysis, with the release of extracellular free heme and hemin, is thought to play a major role in the deadly
pulmonary complications of sickle cell disease. Acute chest syndrome is the second most common cause of
hospitalization for sickle cell disease patients and the leading cause of death. Pulmonary hypertension
complicates sickle cell disease in up to 10% of patients and is associated with significant morbidity and
mortality. Current therapies, including hydroxyurea and blood transfusions, are mostly supportive and have
been used for decades, while specific therapeutics targeting the pulmonary circulation have been elusive. We
hypothesize that hemin, as a breakdown product of cell-free hemoglobin, has direct effects on the pulmonary
endothelium and that concentration specific effects contribute to both the acute and chronic complications of
sickle cell disease. In this proposal, we will evaluate the specific effects of chronic, low concentration hemin in
the development of pulmonary vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension. We propose direct effects on
pulmonary artery endothelial cells through Toll-like receptor 4 lead to endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition.
Endothelial cells undergoing trans-differentiation will have increased proliferative and migratory properties as
well as cytoskeletal rearrangement leading to an invasive, dysfunctional phenotype. In animal models of
chronic hemolysis, this will manifest as pulmonary vascular remodeling with the development and progression
of pulmonary hypertension. Similarly, high concentration hemin will have effects on the pulmonary endothelium
through Toll-like receptor 4, but overwhelming stimulation will lead to activation of necroptosis and
programmed necrosis. This necroptotic cell death will result in endothelial barrier dysfunction and acute lung
injury in cell and animal models as a mechanism for the development of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema
and acute chest syndrome. The concentration dependent effects of hemin on pulmonary artery endothelial
cells and animal models of hemolysis in our work mimic the spectrum of pulmonary complications in sickle cell
disease patients. Therefore, this mechanistic work will complement a translational approach associating
circulating hemin abundance with pulmonary complications in sickle cell disease patients and utilizing RNA
sequencing technology to identify differentially expressed genes and genomic signatures associated with the
presence of pulmonary hypertension and acute chest syndrome. Our long-term goals are to utilize our
understanding of the mechanisms of endothelial dysfunction in both acute and chronic pulmonary
complications of sickle cell disease and other chronic hemolytic syndrome in order to identify novel molecular
targets, develop innovative therapies, impact health and survivorship of patients through our research and
clinical care."
11161736,"Research and Methods Core: Project Summary
The focus of our proposed UPSTREAM Research Center is examining the impacts of income intervention
programs for reducing the long-term burden of cancer in persistent poverty areas. Our proposal to achieve this
is through a scientific and collaborative process that prioritizes both the overlapping and also distinct needs of
the Latino and Vietnamese communities in the persistent poverty areas of Santa Clara County and Yolo
County, CA. The rationale for this approach is that there is robust evidence supporting a fundamental causes
approach to cancer prevention – that is, only through intervening on the “causes of the causes” will we make
substantial progress in reducing the cancer burden in persistent poverty areas. We cannot rely solely on
individual or group behavioral change interventions alone for population reductions in the cancer burden; we
must move ‘upstream’. The Research & Methods Core will support this mission through: Aim 1. Coordinating
data collection, measures and methods and ensuring the interoperability of both quantitative and qualitative
data within the Center and between Centers, Aim 2. Modeling the long-term effects of the project interventions
and other exposures on colorectal cancer incidence, Aim 3. Coordinating with the projects and Cores to create
data dashboards and insights with the persistent poverty communities in ways that will most benefit community
led actions in cancer prevention, Aim 4. Evaluating the Center’s research productivity and impact over the
funding period. The Research and Methods Core will address the needs of the Research projects by
coordinating the collection of similar measures across research projects to enable inference as to the relative
value of different income intervention programs, working with project investigators to coordinate
methodological approaches for inference, and coordinating with project investigators to use estimates from
their analytic data based models for inputs to a mathematical model that will predict population level changes
in colorectal cancer incidence in persistent poverty areas. Across all of the above processes, the Research &
Methods Core will evaluate the Center’s research productivity and impact over the funding period as part of the
leadership team aims outlined in the Administrative Core. The mission of the Research and Methods Core is
driven by two intertwining areas of intended impact – 1) robust and reproducible scientific discovery on the
impact of income interventions on preventing cancer in persistent poverty areas in combination with 2) building
capacity for cancer prevention research in those areas. Our team sees these as inseparable objectives.
Despite the compelling evidence for the impact of addressing social determinants of health as fundamental
causes of disease, less of this work has been based on actual interventions and actions, and even less of this
work in relation to cancer incidence. To build capacity for prevention in persistent poverty areas, this scientific
research needs to be co-produced with these communities in order to have the greatest impact, and the
Research & Methods Core will play a part in this mission of our Center."
11162023,"Cancer is the second most common chronic disease and cause of death in older adults. By 2030, three-
quarters of the 22 million cancer survivors will be 65 and older and the number of survivors from racial/ethnic
minority groups will increase by 99% vs. 31% for Whites. These trends are creating an ethnogeriatric and fiscal
imperative, with healthcare costs of disparities doubling to $50 billion by 2050 due to aging of minority groups
and persistently low quality of life and survival. We are ill-prepared to address these crises because there is
limited evidence to guide clinical care or efforts to reduce disparities among older cancer survivors. This
paucity of data is exacerbated by the low numbers of underrepresented minority (URM) scientists leading
studies and limited engagement of minority stakeholders to enhance trust in research, resulting in an under-
representation of older minority survivors in studies. Progress has been further hampered by the fact that while
researchers from aging and oncology each study disparities, there is no infrastructure integrating these
disciplines. To fill this urgent gap, the “Infrastructure for Research in Equity, Aging, Cancer and Health” (I-
REACH) will use a multi-level disparities framework to integrate geroscience and stakeholder perspectives into
transdisciplinary research bridging the fields of aging, disparities and cancer. I-REACH brings together under
one umbrella the accumulated expertise of four cancer center hubs (Georgetown, University of Maryland,
Karmanos/Wayne State, UCLA), stakeholders, all the major NIA Center programs and national geriatrics,
gerontology and cancer organizations. The goals of I-REACH are to: 1) expand the scientific workforce and
increase the proportion of URM scientists committed to, and supported in careers at the intersection of aging,
disparities and cancer, and 2) deploy this workforce to accelerate discovery and provide evidence for
interventions to improve the health of all older cancer survivors. These goals will be accomplished with three
Cores and two Programs in overlapping phases using a distributed resource, distance-learning approach. In
the two-year R21 phase, we develop, implement and begin to evaluate Cores (Aim 1) and prepare for R33
transition: a Career Development Core providing a mentoring program and a foundational curriculum; a Data
Resources Core enabling use of secondary data to fill knowledge gaps in our disparities framework; and a
Stakeholder Core to integrate stakeholder perspectives and support recruitment of older minorities. In the
three-year R33 phase, the Cores will be deployed to provide a two-year mentored Scholars program for pre-
doctoral, doctoral and early stage to senior scientists (Aim 2) and a Pilot program (Aim 3) funding small grants
to address evidence gaps in our multi-level framework and build sustainability and disseminate results (Aim 4).
Eighty-six scientists (65% women and 36% URM) have already agreed to participate. I-REACH will provide
value-added to the NIH by bridging NIA and NCI priorities and addressing areas not covered in other
programs. I-REACH is ideally timed to address needs of a rapidly growing diverse, older population."

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects up to 1 in 44 children in the United States, and its prevalence has
increased over the past 10 years. Though early access to autism care improves outcomes, children of color
and children from low-income families access care later and have unmet care needs. Though there is a broad
understanding that contextual factors on the neighborhood, community, and state levels impact autism health
care disparities, these factors are largely unexplored. In this proposed research, we will compile the most
comprehensive and largest autism service use dataset ever, combining Medicaid claims from 16 states with
community-level data from the Child Opportunity Index, as well as state education and health care policy data.
We will use this powerful new data set to uncover modifiable determinants of child autism services use
disparities. Analyses will focus on age of diagnosis as well as medication and behavioral therapy use. Then
we will use findings to bring research to action, by engaging a consensus panel of community and research
experts to suggest data-driven, feasible interventions based on study findings. We will also use our research
to expand the diversity of the autism disparities research field, by sponsoring scholars who are under-
represented in medicine and/or who have health disparities research interests, to use the resulting dataset to
pursue additional data analyses. At the end of this project, we expect to have evidence-informed findings
regarding which children access which services, which contextual factors affect services access, and which
interventions can be deployed to address autism health inequities."
11141440,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite antiretroviral therapy, people living with HIV (PLWH) have an increased risk of acquiring oral HPV and
ultimately developing HPV-associated oral and oropharyngeal cancers compared to uninfected groups. While
efforts are being made to understand the epidemiology of HPV-at-risk adult populations, the natural history of
oral HPV in children and adolescents is largely uninvestigated. Determining the natural history of oral HPV
infection in childhood and adolescence is critical in mitigating long-term risk and targeting vaccine intervention
programs. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying the persistence of oral HPV infection in PLWH are unclear,
yet crucial to preventing HPV-associated cancers and diseases. Recent studies of the impact of HIV infection on
the oral microbiome have shown differences in abundance of certain bacteria as compared HIV+ and HIV-
children. Yet, there is limited understanding regarding the key microbial functional pathways that could facilitate
oral HPV infection. The overall objectives of this project are to investigate the natural history of oral HPV infection
and determine the taxonomic and functional roles of the oral microbiome in HPV persistence in the context of
perinatal HIV exposure, infection, and treatment. To accomplish this, we will take advantage of a unique and
large cohort of children/adolescents born to HIV-infected mothers vs. those born to HIV uninfected mothers. The
proposed prospective observational study will recruit three groups of children and their respective mothers in
Nigeria. Namely: 1) HIV-infected (HI), 2) HIV exposed-and-uninfected (HEU) and 3) HIV-unexposed-and-
uninfected (HUU) children. The central hypothesis is that HI and HEU children, compared to HUU children, will
have higher rates of oral HPV type-specific persistence, which is associated with a distinct microbial community
and functional pathways. We will test this hypothesis via three specific aims: 1) Characterize and compare the
natural history of oral HPV infection among youth born to HIV-infected women and uninfected women; 2) Identify
inflammatory-mediated functional pathways associated with oral HPV persistence in children infected with HIV;
and 3) Develop and test a deep learning algorithm based on clinical and oral taxonomic/functional microbiome
profiles to predict oral HPV persistence. For the first aim, oral rinse samples from child-mother pairs will be used
to characterize the dynamics of oral HPV subtype distribution over 2 years of follow-up. The second aim involves
functional characterization of the oral microbiome using whole genome (shotgun sequencing) to investigate its
relationship with HPV-type-specific persistence. For the third aim, we will train neural networks based on
longitudinal microbiome features, cytokine levels, and other risk factors to determine which features strongly
predict oral HPV. This project will lead to a more complete understanding of how impaired immunological states
increase susceptibility to oral HPV infection and persistence. Knowledge gained regarding the contribution of
oral microbiota, will lay a foundation for future prevention and therapeutic interventions."
11143517,"Achieving the necessary, robust and continually evolving evidence base for genomic medicine and its
implementation in clinical practice requires overcoming many practical and logistical challenges. The
Implementing GeNomics In pracTicE (IGNITE) Network has been and will continue to be strategic in identifying
and disseminating solutions to these challenges. Specifically, we will continue to address the absence of
supporting information technology infrastructure, lack of data standards and interoperability, and insufficient
decision support. The effectiveness of IGNITE in achieving its objectives requires an experienced, and well-
organized coordination center (CC) with strong existing ties to genomic medicine, that can recruit participants,
create a vast resource of best practices for pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs), develop and deploy common
measures and standards, identify solutions to challenges in implementation, develop a platform for data
management and data analysis, and disseminate knowledge to the greater community. The proposed IGNITE
II CC, a partnership between the Duke University Center for Applied Genomics and Precision Medicine and the
Duke Clinical Research Institute, will provide a central resource for coordination, cost-effective PCT design,
adaptation, oversight, and integration for the network. Importantly, we will leverage our successful
leadership of the IGNITE I Administrative CC and our deep expertise in coordination of PCTs. The
members of the CC have notable experience in each area required by the RFA as: 1) a demonstration project
AND Administrative CC for IGNITE I, 2) CC for large networks and genomic medicine studies, and 3) CC for
PCTs. The IGNITE II CC will provide strategic organizational leadership for the development of a novel,
flexible, and adaptable genomic medicine PCT platform, enables seamless communication, sharing of
information to optimize network productivity. The CC will ensure optimal and adaptable PCT design, participant
recruitment, and data collection, develop a comprehensive analysis framework for evaluating the
implementation and clinical effectiveness of the genomic medicine interventions, and help disseminate of
knowledge beyond the network. In addition, the CC will innovate in 1) the implementation of pragmatic trial
designs, electronic data capture (EDC) systems, and improved recruitment strategies, 2) institution of common
measures across the network, 3) creative management of affiliates as a force amplifier for the network, 4)
developing a Genomic Medicine Knowledge Base for dissemination, 4) creating a durable longitudinal data
source from IGNITE participants and 5) developing a focus on sustainability. Our team's unparalleled track
record of collaborative genomic medicine research and nationally recognized expertise in coordinating IGNITE
I, large networks, and PCTs uniquely positions us to facilitate the completion of high-impact genomic medicine
PCTs and advance the integration of genomic into clinical care."
11158456,"PROJECT SUMMARY: In the general population, IgG glycomic alterations correlate with and drive inflammatory
responses during aging (inflammaging). However, it was previously unknown whether living with antiretroviral
therapy (ART)-suppressed HIV infection is associated with changes in these markers of inflammaging. During
the last funding cycle, we found that living with ART-suppressed HIV infection is associated with an acceleration
in the accumulation of pro-aging IgG glycomic alterations. Specifically, antibodies from people with HIV (PWH)
on ART show a more significant loss of the anti-inflammatory glycans galactose (agalactosylation) and sialic
acid (hypo-sialylation) compared to antibodies from HIV-negative controls. These glycomic alterations were
linked to higher inflammation and increased severity of inflammaging-associated comorbidities in PWH. In a
proof-of-concept study, we also found that these alterations might precede the development of such
comorbidities by years, making them excellent candidates for discovering biomarkers to predict these conditions.
In addition to their associations with inflammaging in PWH on ART, these glycomic alterations during ART
correlated with a faster HIV rebound after stopping ART. Consistently, levels of these glycans correlate with
elevated levels of HIV DNA during ART. This intriguing correlation between these markers of inflammaging and
HIV persistence prompted us to investigate the mechanisms by which these alterations might contribute to larger
HIV reservoirs and greater inflammaging: 1) Agalactosylation: The loss of galactose reduces the ability of IgGs
to elicit Fc-mediated anti-viral innate immune function. This reduced function could result in a larger HIV reservoir
and, consequently, greater inflammation. Our data support this mechanism, as glycoforms of the HIV antibody
10-1074 engineered to lack galactose exhibited significantly lower anti-HIV immune function than glycoforms
with high galactose. 2) Hypo-sialylation: The loss of sialic acid prevents a potent anti-inflammatory mechanism
by myeloid cells. Our data support this mechanism by showing that treating HIV-infected viremic humanized
mice with sialidase inhibitors (to prevent hypo-sialylation) attenuates HIV-mediated inflammation.
Our current aims capitalize on these findings to start delineating their translational potential with the overarching
hypothesis that agalactosylation and hypo-sialylation: 1) can serve as predictive biomarkers for inflammaging-
associated comorbidities in PWH (Aim 1a); 2) are mechanistically linked to HIV persistence and inflammation by
compromising anti-viral innate immune functions (Aim 1b and Aim 2a); and 3) can be normalized to enhance
immunity and inhibit inflammaging (Aim 2a and Aim 2b). In Aim 1 (human samples aim), we will test the
hypothesis that IgG agalactosylation and hypo-sialylation can predict inflammaging-associated comorbidities in
PWH and are linked to compromised anti-HIV innate immune function and a larger HIV reservoir size. In Aim 2
(animal studies aim), we will test the hypothesis that highly-galactosylated IgGs and sialidase inhibition can
enhance anti-viral immune functions and reduce inflammation in HIV-infected ART-treated humanized mice."
11158458,"Home-based medical care (HBMC) is essential for the growing population of community-living persons with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). People living with ADRD (PLWD) often also have multiple chronic conditions that necessitate complex care regimens, but as functional impairment worsens, PLWD may struggle to leave home to access medical care. HBMC then becomes instrumental in enabling continuity of patient care, tailoring medical management to evolving patient needs and risks and mitigating the caregiving burden. HBMC is provided by physicians and advanced practice providers and has long been covered by public (Fee for Service) Medicare. Due to its limited availability, there are likely many more people who may benefit from HBMC than there are persons who receive HBMC. Two changes in the Medicare landscape over the last decade may significantly alter access to and outcomes from HBMC for PLWD: rapid enrollment and switch to private (Medicare Advantage) plans and the swift expansion of telemedicine use since early 2020. Our study aims to examine HBMC use among PLWD with private and public Medicare, its change following the expansion of telemedicine, and its overall impact on patient outcomes and disparities.
While the rationale for HBMC is compelling, evidence of its impact on PLWD is scant. Evidence of differences in healthcare utilization patterns between private and public Medicare enrollees is recent and evolving, particularly for PLWD, with virtually no prior work on patterns of HBMC use. HBMC providers can combine home visits with telemedicine services and expand the scale and range of services. The extent to which these have occurred in public and private Medicare is unclear.
Using national Medicare administrative data (2017-2023) covering public and private Medicare enrollees with PLWD, we propose to fill the significant evidence gaps by identifying the national trends in HBMC and telemedicine use and rigorously evaluating their potential impact on the management and outcomes for community living PLWD. Our main outcomes will be indicators of treatment for ADRD, deprescribing long-term medications, acute care complications, proportion of days at home, transition to long-term care and hospice, death, and healthcare spending. Using quasi-experimental models of causal inference, we will estimate the potential impact of HBMC (before and after the expansion of telemedicine) and telemedicine, separately in public and private Medicare. We will estimate the impact across subgroups by sex, race, ethnicity, income, serious illness, provider quality performance, and area deprivation index. PLWD have complex medical needs with high mobility and transportation barriers, and HBMC and telemedicine may be vital avenues to facilitate better care continuity, alleviate patient and caregiver burden, and improve patient outcomes. Our findings aim to develop rigorous, generalizable, and policy-oriented evidence on the potential impact of HBMC and telemedicine for PLWD and socioeconomically vulnerable subgroups."
11159255,"ABSTRACT
Our overall goal is to elucidate the different mechanisms available to a neuron to control mitochondria
at a subcellular level, and the genetic bases of these capabilities. Mitochondria accumulate within nerve
terminals where they generate most of the ATP required to package and recycle neurotransmitters and
to maintain transmembrane ion-balances. Neural function is reliant on mitochondrial function to sustain
neurotransmitter release, and mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative
diseases. It is therefore imperative to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that neurons use
to control mitochondria at the sub-cellular level of nerve terminals, and how this might differ between
neuron types. Here we present the hypothesis that sites at which mitochondria interact with the plasma
membrane (PM) represent a form of mitochondrial utilization that confers advantages in those parts of a
neuron with high power demands, such as nerve terminals. We propose to elucidate the functional
significance of such interactions, and their genetic underpinnings. To do this we are adopting a
structure-function approach, exploiting the small size and genetic tools of Drosophila. In Aim 1 we will
use serial block face scanning electron microscopy to determine the neuron types, and subcellular
regions served by mitochondrial-PM interactions. In Aim 2 we will use a novel form of super-resolution
to investigate the formation and disassembly of these interactions, and the functional consequences for
presynaptic physiology and neurotransmission. In Aim 3 we will investigate the role of a select group of
genes identified as candidates for a role in mitochondrial-PM interactions. The significance of this
proposal lies in its potential to uncover novel neuronal and sub-cellular specific mitochondrial functions,
and the genetic bases of these functions, which may throw light on the selective neuronal vulnerability
observed in different neurodegenerative diseases and neurological conditions."
11160280,"Aging is a primary risk factor for development of cardiovascular dysfunction and disease. The hallmarks
of vascular aging are endothelial dysfunction, development of a synthetic, atherosclerotic phenotype in
smooth muscle, and arterial inflammation and stiffening. We have shown that aerobic exercise training
can mitigate or reverse age-related vascular dysfunction and adverse arterial remodeling; however, the
cellular signals that contribute to the ability of exercise training to promote macro- and microvascular
resiliency remain unidentified. Similarly, the mechanisms whereby exercise training reverses age-
related vascular dysfunction remain unknown. Reduced circulating adiponectin has been associated with
the adverse vascular changes that occur with advancing age; however, a role for adiponectin in age-
related vascular dysfunction has not been demonstrated. We have reported that circulating adiponectin
levels increase in response to late-life exercise training; however, a direct role for adiponectin signaling
in reversal of age-related vascular dysfunction by exercise training has not been demonstrated. We
propose to test a central hypothesis that 1) loss of adiponectin is a critical contributor to age-
related vascular dysfunction and adverse arterial remodeling, and 2) adiponectin contributes to
the ability of exercise training to promote vascular resiliency and reverse age-related vascular
dysfunction and age-related adverse vascular remodeling. We propose to study sedentary and
exercise trained mice, across the murine lifespan, to determine 1) the impact of loss- and gain-of-function
of adiponectin on ceramide/sphingosine signaling in the endothelium of the microvasculature of the heart
and skeletal muscle, 2) the impact of loss- and gain-of-function of adiponectin on development of a
senescence-associated synthetic phenotype in vascular smooth muscle and contractile dysfunction the
microvasculature of the heart and skeletal muscle, and 3) the impact of loss- and gain-of-function of
adiponectin on remodeling of large arteries. Results from the proposed work will increase our
understanding of the role of adiponectin in age-related vascular dysfunction and exercise training-induced
reversal of age-related vascular dysfunction. A top biomedical research priority is to identify strategies
which promote vascular resiliency with advancing age or which reverse age-related vascular dysfunction.
The proposed work could identify 1) components of the adiponectin signaling pathway that could be
targeted for prevention of age-related vascular dysfunction, and 2) novel exercise mimetics that could be
employed for 1) promotion of vascular resiliency across the lifespan, and/or 2) reversal of age-related
vascular dysfunction."
11138316,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sexual assault is a persistent public health problem that affects a substantial proportion of college women and
is often associated with increases in heavy drinking to cope with post-assault distress. Survivors often recover
within social networks such as sororities where heavy drinking is normative, and recovery alongside heavy
drinking peers can exacerbate survivors’ drinking to cope. To address this problem, the current application
involves the development of a novel intervention designed to promote effective support of survivors within
social networks of sororities. Support behaviors incompatible with heavy drinking are expected to increase
perceived support among survivors and reduce alcohol use and related consequences among all intervention
recipients. The research plan involves: (1) developing a new web-based intervention in collaboration with
community stakeholders, (2) testing the feasibility of the intervention within a pilot cluster randomized trial, and
(3) examining network characteristics associated with adoption of support behaviors. The objective of the
overall Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) is to provide Dr. Anna Jaffe
with the research support and training needed to become an independent researcher in the field of alcohol
research. Dr. Jaffe has a strong foundation researching the intersection between alcohol use and sexual
assault, but requires additional training to become an intervention researcher capable of contributing to broad
change by leveraging technology to administer brief interventions within social networks. Administrative
support is needed to ensure the pilot cluster randomized trial is successfully completed following the critical life
event of childbirth and subsequent caretaking responsibilities. Administrative support will be used to hire a
research coordinator to complete essential tasks, including assisting with survey setup and testing, recruitment
and retention efforts, participant payments, and data management and cleaning. This support will facilitate
successful implementation of the pilot cluster randomized trial, including higher enrollment and retention, will
provide pilot data to support a R01 submission to test the intervention on a larger scale and evaluate the
spread of supportive behaviors through social networks. This supplement will also ensure the PI continues to
focus on mentored training activities in intervention development and evaluation, implementation of social
network methods and analyses, and professional development through manuscript and grant writing. Thus,
administrative support to complete the K08 activities will ultimately prepare Dr. Jaffe to lead an innovative and
rigorous program of research to reduce alcohol misuse after sexual assault through technology-based
interventions."

It has been reported that depletion of RUNX21 or LepR2 in mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells (MSPCs) reduces bone mass and increases bone marrow (BM) adipocytes (BMA), and that PDGFRβ activation drives MSPC expansion and BM vasculogenesis, finally influencing hematopoiesis3. Our preliminary data show that mice lacking SHP2 in the Osterix+ stromal progenitor cells (O+SPCs) have similarly increased BMA and BM vasculature and skewed lymphopoiesis. We have not yet determined the molecular mechanism(s) by which SHP2 exerts its influence on O+SPCs and hematopoietic cells. However, the phenotypic similarity of mice lacking SHP2, RUNX2, LepR, or PDGFR in O+SPCs leads us to hypothesize that SHP2 influences the osteogenic, adipogenic and/or stromogenic fate of O+SPCs by modifying the transcription activity of RUNX2 and the kinase activity of PDGFR, and that altered BM O+SPCs change the cellular and molecular constituents of the BM niche and subsequently hematopoiesis. To test this novel hypothesis, we will complete two specific aims. In Aim 1 we will interrogate the impact of SHP2 depletion on RUNX2 transcriptional activity in O+SPCs, while in Aim 2 we will determine the effect of SHP2 depletion on stromogenic differentiation of O+SPCs and hematopoisis in vitro and in vivo. O+SPCs participate in BM hematopoietic niche construction and maintenance, and both SHP2 and RUNX2 influence O+SPCs. This innovative study will yield foundational information regarding SHP2’s regulatory role in O+SPCs and its consequent role in hematopoiesis and BM vasculogenesis. This information will significantly advance our understanding of the effect and importance of crosstalk between BM stromal cells and hematopoietic cells, and hematopoietic malignancy."

childhood. RSV is the primary cause of bronchiolitis in children worldwide, and it is considered the most impactful
risk factor for asthma development among causative pathogens. There is currently no vaccine approved, and
therapeutic options are limited. The mechanism by which early-life RSV (EL-RSV) infection predisposes to
asthma later in life is unknown. Our studies will investigate the mechanism behind asthma development after
EL-RSV infection by focusing on long-term lung epithelial alteration generated by epigenetic modification.
We will specifically investigate the role of the innate cytokines IL-1 and IL-33 in long-term lung epithelial
alteration since we had observed these cytokines highly upregulated during RSV infection. The present proposal
provides preliminary data demonstrating that EL-RSV infection generates long-term phenotypic changes in the
alveolar epithelial cell type II (AT2) through epigenetic modification in the Il33 gene and Ilr1 promoters. These
phenotypic changes in the lung epithelium after EL-RSV infection likely modify airway allergic reactions later in
life. Thus, we will address our hypothesis that EL-RSV infection generates long-lasting lung epithelium
alterations that impact lung responsiveness to allergens.
This leads to the upregulation of innate immune mediators, such as IL-33, that increase the risk of
developing airway allergies later in life. This hypothesis will be tested by the following specific aims: Aim 1-
To define whether EL-RSV infection generates long-lasting changes in the lung epithelium that leads to
subsequent allergic disease. We hypothesize that EL-RSV causes long-lasting changes in the lung
epithelium, which modify the lung epithelial cell's phenotype in the lung, leading to lung functional changes and
respiratory allergies later in life. Aim 2- To determine if RSV infection generates epigenetic modifications
in the lung epithelial cells that generate long-term alterations in the lung epithelium responsiveness. We
hypothesize that RSV infections drive lung epithelial cell long-term alteration by modifying the chromatin
organization and accessibility across the genome through histone modification. Aim 3- To identify the
mechanisms involved in generating the long-term alteration in the lung epithelium by focusing on the
positive feedback loop between IL-1 and IL-33 during RSV infection. Our working hypothesis is that the IL-
1/IL-33 upregulation during EL-RSV infection is critical for generating long-lasting modification in the lung
epithelium that may promote phenotypic alterations in the respiratory epithelium by epigenetic modification. We
hypothesize that EL-RSV infections drive airway epithelial cell alteration by modifying the organization and
accessibility of the chromatin across the genome by histone modification. Understanding these mechanisms will
be crucial for developing interventional therapies that attenuate RSV disease severity and the predisposition to
childhood asthma."

Tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2) consists of three Kunitz domains arranged in tandem flanked by a
short acidic amino terminus and a highly basic C-terminal tail. The N-terminal Kunitz domain (KD)1 of TFPI-2 is
the only inhibitory domain and it inhibits plasmin (Pm), factor (F) XIa, plasma kallikrein (pKLK), and very weakly
FVIIa/tissue factor. The structural specificity of TFPI-2 KD1 for each protease is essentially unknown. The focus
of this proposal is to delineate the TFPI-2 KD1 residues, which impart specificity toward Pm, FXIa and pKLK
through structural and functional studies. Another goal is to design and test novel, potent and specific inhibitors
of fibrinolysis, which have the potential to reduce bleeding in major surgeries without causing adverse effects
attributed to broad spectrum protease inhibitors of Pm, like bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI, Aprotinin).
Using structure-based investigations and analyzing the serine proteases substrate specificity profiles, we have
developed two TFPI-2 KD1 variants to specifically inhibit Pm. These TFPI-2 KD1 variants are dual reactive
inhibitors that selectively inhibit plasmin active site as well as the activation of plasminogen by binding to the
kringle domains of plasminogen/plasmin and tissue plasminogen activator. Our new data indicate that these two
TFPI-2 KD1 variants are potent and selective inhibitors of Pm with no detectable inhibition of FXIa and pKLK.
We will study the efficacy and toxicity of these two KD1 variants in mouse models of bleeding. Since trauma
associated hemorrhage and coagulopathy are leading causes of mortality, we will also study the safety and
efficacy of the potent KD1 variant in a rat trauma model, where the most potent KD1 will be selected based on
the results from the mouse bleeding models. The three overlapping areas to be investigated in this proposal are:
1) Delineate the residues/segments that impart protease specificity of KD1 for Pm, FXIa and pKLK. 2) Assess
the efficacy and safety of the two TFPI-2 KD1 variants in two mouse models of bleeding. 3) Evaluate safety and
efficacy of the most potent KD1 variant in a rat liver hemorrhage model in acute and chronic settings. The
proposed studies will significantly improve our understanding of the specificity of the proteases involved in
coagulation and fibrinolysis. Further, it will lead to the development of a potent, specific inhibitor of Pm that can
be used as a therapeutic agent to inhibit fibrinolysis. The applications of such therapeutic agents are broad and
encompass trauma, cardiovascular surgery, as well as neurologic and orthopedic operations that are
complicated by fibrinolysis."

Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP) is a condition of aging that has been associated with
increased risk of heart disease and heart failure. CHIP is evaluated by DNA sequencing of peripheral blood.
However, not all patients with CHIP will develop heart failure or myocardial infarction. Our preliminary data
demonstrate that CHIP patients (cancer and non-cancer patients) have a higher burden of nonischemic scarring
in their hearts on cardiac MRI compared to patients without CHIP. In a pilot cohort using a machine learning
technique of convolutional neural networks (CNN), we are able to predict who have CHIP with 86% accuracy
and predicted future cardiomyopathy with an accuracy of 73%, thus opening the door to possible image guided
risk stratification for identifying patients with CHIP as well as predict future cardiac outcomes. We also find
through our novel deep learning algorithm that we can identify extended somatic variants that are CHIP-like that
can impact heart failure outcomes and through integration of patient data, genomic and imaging signatures, we
are able to develop partition risk scores that can weigh the variables such as CHIP and their contribution to heart
failure and the pathways involved. We hypothesize that using cardiac MRI, novel machine learning
techniques on large imaging datasets can identify CHIP vs non-CHIP patients as well as predict who will
develop adverse cardiovascular outcomes and that CNNs can be used on both imaging and genomic
signatures in large cohorts like the TOPMED, UKB and All of Us to predict cardiovascular outcomes
while pathway analyses will reveal mechanisms and novel targets for CHIP-mediated cardiomyopathy
Specific Aim #1 will use a novel CNN with multi-view cross-attention to identify MRI features that can accurately
predict CHIP as well as future adverse outcomes such as heart failure and myocardial infarction that will be
validated in large datasets like TOPMed, UKB and All of Us with a collective ~13000 cardiac MRIs. Specific Aim
#2 will use artificial intelligence approaches and a novel analysis pipeline that combines patient data, cardiac
MRI signatures and genomic signatures of CHIP and extended somatic variants that are predictive of
cardiovascular outcomes to help reveal mechanisms behind CHIP’s contribution to cardiomyopathy."
11175773,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The most common congenital heart disease (CHD) in children involves incomplete formation of the
interventricular septum (IVS), which occurs in isolation or as part of more complex CHD lesions. Myocardial fiber
orientation, lineage tracing and asymmetric gene expression together suggest distinct L-R patterning of the IVS.
However, there exists a gap in the understanding of the developmental mechanisms of IVS patterning and VSD
etiologies. This hinders improvements to CHD prenatal screening, prognosis and evaluation of extra-cardiac
anomalies, as well as efforts to engineer tissue patches for heart repair. The overall objective of this proposal
is to delineate how L-R IVS patterning is controlled, and how perturbations lead to VSDs. We have preliminary
data that suggests the secreted guidance cues Ntn1 and Slit2 control boundary regulation for L-R patterning of
the IVS. Both genes were dysregulated in a genetic pathway dependent on the CHD-linked transcription factor,
Tbx5. We found that homozygous loss of function (LOF) of Ntn1 or Slit2 resulted in membranous or muscular
VSDs and a trabecular-like IVS. Ntn1 LOF led to displacement of the IVS boundary toward the LV, suggesting
that Ntn1 may be a key regulator of boundary positioning. Conversely, Slit2 LOF disrupted boundary integrity,
leading to mixing of RV and LV lineages, suggesting Slit2 regulation of boundary maintenance. Based on these
preliminary data, we hypothesize that NTN1 and SLIT2 control complementary aspects of boundary regulation
to segregate LV and RV lineages at the IVS for L-R patterning and ventricular septation. To discover how these
developmental cues direct ventricular septation, we propose the following three Specific Aims: (1) test the
hypothesis that NTN1 from the left side of the IVS determines boundary positioning for L-R IVS patterning by
chemorepulsion, (2) test the hypothesis that a SLIT2 signal from the RV and LV maintains boundary integrity to
preserve cell segregation for L-R IVS patterning by chemorepulsion of IVS cells, and (3) test the hypothesis that
boundary perturbations of L-R IVS patterning cause cell signature disturbances of misplaced cells and adjacent
tissue microenvironments. Successful completion of this project will provide insights into the regulation of L-R
IVS patterning and the origins of human CHDs. By expanding our comprehension of the basis of CHDs, we will
take an important step towards our long-term goal to improve the natural history of CHDs."

Bone responds to many signals and cues to regulate its mass and quality. During the last funding period, we identified
a pathway by which several bone anabolic agents regulate an important bone effector protein, sclerostin. This
regulation of sclerostin occurred at a surprisingly rapid time scale (minutes) in bone cells and occurred via post-
translational control of sclerostin protein destruction by the lysosome, prior to changes in gene expression. A central
integrator of these bone anabolic cues that converged on sclerostin protein destruction was the serine/threonine kinase,
CaMKII. To test the role of CaMKII in vivo in bone anabolism, we generated osteoblast-lineage (OCN-Cre)
conditional deletion mice of the two Camk2 genes expressed in the osteoblast-lineage, Camk2d and Camk2g. Prior to
these deletions, very little was known about CaMKII signaling in bone cells, and what data did exist suggested only a
relatively subtle role in osteoblast differentiation. To our surprise, these conditional knockout mice revealed a severe,
post-natal skeletal phenotype that included a large decrease in bone mass in the trabecular and cortical compartments,
spanning the appendicular and axial skeleton as well as the skull. In addition to low bone mass, these mice exhibited
skeletal fragility, markedly reduced mechanical properties, and a surprising defect in phosphate homeostasis. Given
the severity of this phenotype, we were unable to challenge this mouse with bone anabolic cues in vivo, although we
did demonstrate defective sclerostin control ex vivo in response to some bone anabolic cues. The severity of this
skeletal phenotype on this mouse is on par with the deletion of beta-catenin, a key signal integrator for bone formation,
in bone cells, and establishes CaMKII as a fundamentally important pathway controlling bone homeostasis. In this
application, our goal is to understand the unexpected role of CaMKII in osteoblast and osteocyte physiology. We will
test the hypothesis that CaMKII is a node of convergence that plays an essential role in bone physiology, including
phosphate homeostasis, the degradation of sclerostin in response to bone anabolic cues, and the post-translational
control of key effector proteins in bone. In three aims, we will examine the independent roles of Camk2d and Camk2g
in the osteoblast/osteocyte and their individual and combined impacts on osteoblast/osteocyte protein and gene
expression; disentangle the molecular contributions to the severe skeletal phenotypes of the Camk2d and Camk2g
conditional knockout mice; and resolve the role of CaMKII as a signaling node regulating sclerostin degradation for
bone anabolic signals in vivo. In total, these experiments will provide much greater insight into the unexpectedly
severe post-natal skeletal phenotype in Camk2d and Camk2g in bone, clarify their respective contributions, provide
insight into the major effector proteins driving this multifactorial phenotype, identify the targets of CaMKII action in
osteocytes, and answer the unresolved question as to the contribution of this pathway to bone anabolic signals and
sclerostin post-translational control."

 Nucleoli produce 1-10 million ribosomes per cell. They are membraneless organelles in the nu-
cleus formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). Dysregulation of ribosome synthesis causes
many inherited and somatic diseases. How phase separation contributes to ribosome biogenesis is un-
known. We focus on the dense fibrillar component (DFC) of the nucleolus. Nascent pre-ribosomal
RNAs (rRNAs) extend into the DFC as they are modified, folded, and processed with the aid of hun-
dreds of biogenesis factors and modifying small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs). How these
processes coalesce to produce properly processed and folded rRNA that is fully modified at some 200
nucleotides is a mystery. To elucidate this complex but efficient process, we need to understand how
the DFC is formed, how it enables cotranscriptional RNA modification, and how it is impacted by inher-
ited disease. Having identified the snoRNP chaperone Nopp140 and the pseudouridine synthase
NAP57 (aka dyskerin and Cbf5) while studying snoRNPs for over 30 years, puts us in a favorable posi-
tion to successfully address these questions in the following three aims. One, determine how the dense
fibrillar component of the nucleolus forms, two, identify the mechanism of cotranscriptional RNA modifi-
cation, and three, define the impact of dyskeratosis congenita. We show in preliminary data that
Nopp140 concentrates snoRNPs through interaction with their intrinsically disordered domains. We
identify a novel disordered C-terminal domain in an RNA polymerase I subunit PAF49 that also binds
Nopp140. Based on these data we hypothesize that snoRNPs concentrate at pol I via Nopp140 to co-
transcriptionally modify rRNA. This process is supported by LLPS, which forms the DFC. Additionally,
missense mutations in NAP57 and other RNP components impact both processes, LLPS and rRNA
modification. In this application, we will test these hypotheses. Understanding biogenesis and function
of the DFC, the link between snoRNP abundance and rRNA modification, and the impact of inherited
disease provides a basis for therapeutic intervention."

This administrative supplement proposes K12 and postdoctoral scholar funding for the University of California,
San Francisco (UCSF) and Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Division of Research’s Building
Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women’s Health (BIRCWH) Program. Program objectives are to:
1. Recruit a superb and diverse group of early-career women’s health researchers;
2. Provide tailored training and mentoring on sex and gender influences in health and disease;
3. Build upon our existing program by targeting topics in women’s health of public health importance;
4. Strengthen and integrate models of interdisciplinary research to develop researchers who foster
 linkages across disciplines and institutions and excel in building team science; and to
5. Promote the prominence of women’s health and the retention of investigators underrepresented in
 clinical research by mentoring BIRCWH scholars and alumni in academic advancement and leadership.
The rationale of our program is that scholars’ successful careers in women’s health will transform biomedical
research and ultimately advance women’s health and improve health equity in the US through sustained focus
on the study of sex and gender influences in health and disease. The program brings together mentors and
advisors from 16 UCSF departments and centers and from KPNC and emphasizes interdisciplinary
approaches to a wide range of women’s health issues. We will continue the program’s initiatives in path-
breaking research in women’s cancers; environmental health; mental health, addiction, and cognition;
infectious diseases; metabolism and bone health; and reproductive health across the lifespan. A UCSF/KPNC
Advisory Committee oversees the program in partnership with leadership, along with newly appointed external
advisory members for greater outreach to underrepresented scholars. Our program is strengthened by
mentoring teams that cross disciplines and with our newly offered training in mentoring across differences.
Diverse scholars and faculty—in terms of fields of interest, background, training, race/ethnicity, and gender—
are a priority. We connect scholars to a network of our BIRCWH scholars and alumni, including investigators
underrepresented in medicine for ongoing peer and mentor support. Our BIRCWH scholars receive tailored
mentoring, and participate in training courses, program seminars, progress assessments, and leadership
development activities. An array of career development and training opportunities at the UCSF Clinical and
Translational Science Institute (CTSI) support our BIRCWH program. The career development path for each
scholar is tailored to the specific experience and mentoring that will most effectively support transition to
independence. Our program evaluation follows a conceptual framework of important domains to scholar career
development, with survey measures that assess scholar outcomes such as career trajectory, scientific
productivity, and BIRCWH program effectiveness for up to 10 years afterwards."
11177329,"SUMMARY
 To prepare for the next emerging infection, our goal is to establish a state-of-the-art Emerging
Infectious Diseases Research Center with surveillance for the key disease syndromes – respiratory disease,
encephalitis and fever of unknown origin– that have been observed most frequently associated with emerging
viruses in the past few decades. In parallel, surveillance of animal and insect vectors will be performed to
identify the origins of and define transmissions patterns associated with, these novel emerging viruses. The
Center includes four international surveillance sites–China, Hong Kong, Nepal and Ethiopia– which were
carefully selected on the basis of having either an established history of viral emergence or high potential to
capture such events. China, Hong Kong and Nepal are all situated in Southeast Asia, which has historically
been a nidus for many emerging viruses such as H5N1 influenza, SARS Coronavirus, Severe Fever and
Thrombocytopenia virus, and the very recently reported Alongshan virus. Ethiopia, along with Northeastern
Africa, is at high risk for emergence of MERS Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) due to endemicity of MERS in camels,
a key reservoir in the region. To identify novel or emerging viruses, we will use complementary virus family-
specific consensus PCR and unbiased next generation sequencing approaches and then sequence their
complete genomes. Subsequently, we will generate key reagents essential for establishment of diagnostic
assays and the study of fundamental aspects of viral pathogenesis, epidemiology, and immune control. These
include development of cell culture systems, targeted RT-PCR/PCR assays, serological assays, monoclonal
antibodies for antigen detection and potential therapeutic applications, mouse models of infection, and if
appropriate, ferret models of virus transmission. An additional component of the center is international capacity
building. Initial efforts focus on two exemplar viruses: MERS-CoV, a recently emerged virus, and a highly
variant Dengue virus, Dengue virus 5, which is has prevalence and emergence potential. MERS-CoV is a
deadly zoonotic respiratory pathogen with a case fatality rate of ~35% to date. We will implement surveillance
for these viruses and develop additional reagents and assays to characterize their epidemiology and
pathogenic potential. These efforts will establish and validate the critical infrastructure necessary to respond to
a new emerging infectious disease. In the event of a new outbreak, efforts will be reprioritized to focus on
response to the new emerging threat. The priorities, in order, are: (1) Human and animal surveillance for
novel/emerging viruses; (2) Assay and reagent development; (3) Define epidemiology of novel/emerging
viruses; (4) Pathogenesis, immune control, transmission and treatment of novel/emerging viruses."

The goals of the parent project UNZA-Vanderbilt Training Partnership for HIV-NCD Research (UVP-2)
are to build the University of Zambia (UNZA)’s research capacity by continuing our “sandwich” model of PhD
training. We have used a similar model to develop a postdoctoral training program to further strengthen the
pipeline of independent UNZA scientists. With this supplement, we will introduce new training mechanisms
and support structures at UNZA and Mulungushi University (MU), through the Zambia Leadership in
Research Program (ZAMLead). ZAMLead will enhance and expand prior research training in Zambia by (1)
building critical competencies in leadership and management, strategic partnerships, and policy and
advocacy for diverse trainees (students, post-doctoral fellows, junior faculty) with different areas of scientific
expertise, and (2) enhancing diverse perspectives in the UVP2 parent grant by including new institutional
partners who are based in underserved, geographically different, and/or rural or semi-urban areas and
expand much needed support for future leaders in research at those institutions.
The current supplement request responds to NIH’s Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) NOT-TW-24-006
Opportunity Pathways in Global Health Research and Training. There is a pressing need for additional
capacity building for research scientists in Zambia, particularly for under-represented and diverse
populations. Leaders at UNZA and the Vanderbilt Institute for Global Health (VIGH) have collaborated since
1998 to train Zambian and American scientists to build institutional capacity and develop researcher skills
across numerous grant-funded training programs. However, additional innovative ways to support
researchers’ career development and diverse trainees will be crucial to meet the need of building an inclusive
national workforce in research in Zambia. After conducting a needs assessment, we propose to develop a
2-month pilot training program in research leadership that leverages past skill-building workshops for
Zambian research leaders. This program will include targeted new trainings and expanded structured
mentorship opportunities to meet the unique needs of diverse research leaders in various higher education
institutions in Zambia. To accomplish these goals, we aim to (1) Develop a new research leadership training
program for diverse Zambian researchers in the country utilizing Community Advisory Boards to bring diverse
perspectives to the research enterprise; (2) Implement a pilot ZAMLead Program to train 20 fellows in
leadership and management, strategic partnerships, and policy and advocacy; (3) Use an iterative evaluation
model to optimize the sustainability of the training program as a component for facuty and trainee
development and (4) Create a strategic plan for scaling the program to other universities across Zambia.
Consistent with the NIH Supplement objectives, the overall goal of this initiative is to bolster professional
competencies of investigators in Zambia and the region so that they are well-equipped to initiate and lead
research at their local institutions."

Failure to regenerate myelin in multiple sclerosis (MS) contributes to progressive axonal loss and
accumulated disability. We have found that the pharmacological inhibition of Slc7a5, a large
neutral amino acid transporter, significantly increases a cluster of microglia/macrophages
associated with regeneration in demyelinated lesions, leading to enhanced remyelination in mice.
How Slc7a5 inhibition influences microglial activity and impact the lesion microenvironment during
remyelination remains unknown. Here, we hypothesize that Slc7a5 inhibition shfits the activation
state of microglial cells in demyelinated lesions towards a pro-regenerative state, thereby
increasing oligodendrocyte differentiation and the remyelination process. To this end, we will
examine the impact of conditional Slc7a5 deletion in microglia and macrophages on
oligodendrocyte and microglia/macrophage responses during remyelination (Aim 1), examine the
metabolic and proteomic composition of pro-regenerative myeloid cells from demyelinated lesions
of mice under Slc7a5 loss-of-function (Aim 2), and examine candidate microglia/macrophage
expressed factors in in the regulation of remyelination under Slc7a5 deletion (Aim 3). The results
of this study will reveal new mechanisms of microglia-oligodendrocyte interaction during
remyelination, and potentially lead to new therapeutic strategies targeting microglial plasticity in
demyelinated lesions to improve remyelination in MS."
11138319,"Both gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) affect pregnancy, birth
outcomes, and postpartum care. They are independent risk factors for diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension
(HTN), and mental health conditions such as postpartum depression (PPD). Despite recommendations that
postpartum care should include blood pressure (BP), blood glucose (BG) monitoring, and PPD screening,
current postpartum care practices have low screening rates, especially among Medicaid beneficiaries. While
Medicaid covers nearly half of deliveries in the United States, many birthing people lose coverage 60 days
after birth. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 provided states with federal funding to extend postpartum
coverage up to 12 months – Louisiana and Mississippi have done so while Arkansas has not. Additionally, on
August 1, 2022, Louisiana enacted a statewide mandate requiring providers of postnatal care to screen for
PPD and related mental health disorders. Using our collaboration with the National Birth Equity Collaborative
and combined expertise, we propose to evaluate the effects of the Medicaid postpartum extension (MPE) and
PPD screening mandate on screening behaviors, health outcomes, and patient experiences in Louisiana (LA)
compared to Mississippi (MS) and Arkansas (AR). We will link electronic health records and Medicaid claims
data in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas allowing us to track screening and follow-up care even after
birthing people lose Medicaid coverage. The primary effectiveness measure will be a 3-month composite
screening rate for BP, BG, and PPD. Secondary measures include individual screening rates, diagnoses, and
management of T2DM, HTN, and PPD. It is also critical to understand contextual factors and health inequities
that contribute to disparities in postpartum care and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these policies. The
overall goal is to evaluate effective implementation strategies that aim to improve maternal postpartum health
in Medicaid beneficiaries with GDM or PIH. To achieve this goal, the study will have three specific aims. First,
we will examine the effectiveness of Louisiana’s and Mississippi’s MPE and Louisiana’s PPD screening
mandate on the rates of BG and BP monitoring, PPD screening, rates of T2DM, HTN, and PPD diagnoses,
T2DM, HTN and PPD management, health disparities, and health care utilization, as compared to counterparts
in Arkansas. The second aim will be to examine the cost-effectiveness and distributional cost-effectiveness of
the MPE and PPD screening mandate from the patient, provider, payer, and social perspectives. The third aim
will be to examine the complex contextual factors that influence adopting and implementing MPE and PPD
screening mandates, and subsequent impacts on healthcare delivery, healthcare utilization, and maternal
health equity within and between Louisiana, Mississippi, and Arkansas. Findings will inform concurrent and
future health policy strategies for informing, engaging, and empowering birthing people to improve maternal
health outcomes and eliminate maternal health disparities in the United States."

Nytricx is developing a new class of Nitric Oxide (NO)-releasing intravascular medical catheters to combat
infection and thrombosis associated with indwelling vascular catheters. NO gas is a natural anti-infective and
anti-thrombotic human product principally released from blood vessels and immune cells. Nytricx NO-releasing
technology to the catheter surfaces via a polymer matrix, mimics the natural release by cells to prevent infection
and thrombosis. The Nytricx technology is designed to combine anti-infective and anti-thrombotic properties of
Nitric Oxide (NO) release at the internal and external catheter interfaces, which may be an extremely effective
means to prolong catheter life, decrease chronic infection, and blood clotting (thrombosis) associated with
intravascular catheters. The combination of a novel topcoats with NO gas release from the base silicone polymer
is unique, especially considering that the NO donor itself stays embedded in the polymer with only the NO gas
escaping to affect the external and internal catheter environments. The topcoat also affects biofilm formation
which is also a chronic problem associated with catheter infections preventing effective antibiotic therapy. Nytricx
NO-releasing technology represents a disruptive innovation that will result in saving patients’ lives and cutting
medical costs, especially those related to hospital acquired blood steam infections and thrombosis, associated
with intravascular catheters."

continues to rise. HFpEF disproportionately affects women after menopause and has a high mortality rate. Due
to the lack of well-characterized mechanisms and targeted therapy, treatment of this underappreciated disease
remains focused on symptoms and does not address the underlying structural changes of cardiac remodeling
that are key to disease progression. I propose to identify the mechanisms underlying the primary structural
cardiac changes that occur in HFpEF in a sex specific manner. Specifically, in this study, I propose that
Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is an attractive target in cardiac remodeling noted in HFpEF.
Mechanistically, myocardial TGF-β activation is a common element in HFpEF. However, TGF-β inhibition is
impractical due to the associated toxicity, necessitating the search for other options to influence this pathway.
TSP-1 is a matricellular protein that has no structural role, but modulates cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions by
interacting with growth factors and surface receptors. Moreover, it is induced in metabolic syndrome, activates
TGF-β1, and inhibits metalloproteinase activity in the heart, which could modulate fibrotic pathways. My central
hypothesis is that is that TSP-1 is a key matricellular protein and local mediator of TGF-β1-induced
cardiac fibrosis whose expression and activation in cardiac fibroblasts is modified by sex hormones,
resulting in augmented collagen deposition and crosslinking. I will investigate the effect of biological sex
on TSP-1 activation, TGF-β signaling, and subsequent dysregulation of cell behavior, tissue mechanics, and
ventricular function. I will also determine the therapeutic potential of targeting TSP-1 in a rodent model of HFpEF.
In Aim 1, my goal is to determine the regulatory mechanisms of TSP-1 and downstream consequences of
TSP-1 induction in cardiac fibroblasts. Using human cardiac fibroblasts cells, I will identify the mechanisms
by which hypoxia and hyperglycemia induce TSP-1, which then activates TGF-β1 and fibrosis.
In Aim 2, my goal is to determine if a gain of androgen signaling boosts TSP-1 expression. Using human
cardiac fibroblasts, we will describe the relative gain of androgen signaling post-menopause TSP-1 levels in
relation to TGF-β activation.
In Aim 3, my goal is to establish TSP-1 as a targetable enzyme in HFpEF. Using an in vivo rat model of
HFpEF we will test if TSP-1 inhibition prevents or reverses HFpEF ex vivo and in vivo.
This study will establish 1) the therapeutic potential for TSP-1 inhibition in HFpEF, 2) that ratio of estrogen to
androgen modifies cardiac remodeling as opposed to absolute hormone levels, and 3) introduce a new
therapeutic approach and a new target to treat HFpEF by addressing matrix remodeling. In addition, completion
of this project will allow me to align my clinical expertise as a cardiac anesthesiologist with my research focus
and fully transition me to an independent investigator."

The primary goal of the Proteomics and Metabolomics Shared Resource (PMSR) is to provide comprehensive
proteomics and metabolomics services to Cancer Center members as well as other regional NCI-designated
Cancer Centers (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University Cancer Center), and secondarily to
investigators in other academic institutions. Prior to December 2017, major mass spectrometry (MS)
instruments in the PMSR included a Thermo Q Exactive HF, a Thermo Q Exactive Plus, and a Sciex QTRAP
5500 hybrid triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. These instruments have nano-UHPLCs (ultra-high pressure
liquid chromatography) with cooled-autosamplers on the front end for proteomic analyses. A conventional flow
UHPLC is used for metabolite analyses. These LC-MS systems represent some of the highest performing,
most sensitive instruments currently available. The PMSR will continue to offer routine proteomic services such
as LC-MS/MS protein identifications from gel bands or pull-down assays, and intact protein analysis by
electrospray ionization. Over the last budget cycle, the PMSR has increasingly engaged in more challenging
proteomics problems, particularly global quantitative comparisons of proteomes or sub-proteomes using label-
free quantitation (integrated MS ion currents), quantitation using stable isotopes such as SILAC or isobaric tags
(TMT or iTRAQ), and in-depth global analysis of phosphoproteome, ubiquitomes, and acetylomes. The PMSR
will continue to improve its analytical capabilities for in-depth comprehensive analysis of global proteome and
posttranslational modifications. The PMSR has also responded to the growing need of Cancer Center
members in the field of cancer metabolism by establishing targeted relative quantitation of approximately 180
polar metabolites. To further increase its capacity in metabolomics analysis, the PMSR applied for and was
recently awarded an S10 shared instrumentation grant (S10 OD023586). This grant together with Cancer
Center funds were used to purchase a high-resolution Thermo Q Exactive HF-X mass spectrometer and a
Vanquish UHPLC system. This instrument was installed in December 2017 and will be dedicated to untargeted
(global) metabolomics, targeted metabolomics, untargeted lipidomics, targeted lipidomics and metabolic flux
analysis using stable isotope tracers. The PMSR also recently purchased a Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer funded
by another S10 grant (S10 OD023658). This instrument can quantify mitochondrial respiration, glycolytic
activity, endogenous and exogenous fatty acid oxidation, substrate oxidation, and metabolic phenotype,
providing complementary analytical capacity to the new metabolomics LC-MS/MS system. The availability of
these new instruments will ensure that the PMSR remains state-of-the-art in providing proteomics,
metabolomics, and lipidomics services to Cancer Center members. The major emphasis of the PMSR will be to
provide expert consultation and state-of-the-art proteomics and metabolomics technologies operating at
maximum performance and affordable costs to address complex cancer biology questions."

10745726,"Obesity prevalence is >39% in the USA. Obesity increases estrone synthesis in fat; and both obesity and
estrone correlate with increased postmenopausal ER+ breast cancer risk and mortality. We aim to elucidate
how estrone links obesity, inflammation and breast cancer. Obese fat is chronically inflamed via NFκB
activation. We found breast fat inflammation increases with obesity, after menopause and surrounding
cancers. Breast cancer:adipocyte contact upregulates proinflammatory cytokines that stimulate NFκB- and
estrone:ERα-dependent cancer stem cell (CSC) expansion. We showed the dominant premenopausal
estradiol (E2) and postmenopausal estrone (E1) regulate different genes. While E2-bound ERα inhibits NFκB,
we showed E1-bound ERα is an NFκB co-activator and induces gene profiles of inflammation, EMT, CSC
expansion and metastasis, while E2 did not. Finally, E1: ERα caused more cytokine gene induction, stem cell
expansion, and ER+ tumor growth and metastasis than E2 in vivo. While our in vivo data suggest E1 driven
ER-NFκB co-targets promote tumor progression, little is known about how E1-bound ER and NFκB interact at
chromatin, and how their co-regulators differ from those of E2-ER. Up to 30% of metastatic ER+ BC develop
activating ESR1 mutations. We found while 3D growth of MCF7 controls is greater with E1 than E2; both
stimulate 3D growth of ER mutant MCF7 lines equally. Further, both ER mutants direct greater NFκB
activation upon either E1 or E2 treatment, suggesting that the altered mutant ER conformation might direct
greater ER-p65κB activation. We hypothesize that E1-ERα target gene selection, co-regulators, and
expression differ from those of E2:ERα and that therapy-induced ERα mutants will permit pro-inflammatory,
oncogenic, and prometastatic ERα-NFκB target genes, normally activated only by E1-bound ER-WT, to be
indiscriminately activated by either E1 or E2 in cancers. Aim 1 will test how E1 and E2 driven gene expression
differs, comparing ChIPseq of ER, p65κB and FOXA1 and correlating these with gene expression profiles in
ER+ cancer lines and organoids stimulated by E1 vs E2, +/- NFκB. Aim 2 To identify co-regulators unique to
E1 and E2-liganded ERα that mediate gene induction or repression, we carry out i) ChIP-Mass Spec in cells
treated with E1 or E2, +/- NFκB activation; and ii) Gradient-Seq to separate euchromatin from heterochromatin
followed by ChIPseq and ChIP-Mass Spec to identify the E1- vs E2-liganded ERα interactome in transactivator
versus repressor complexes. Aim 3 will test if both E1 and E2 i) cause greater ER:p65 binding and ii)
preferential activation of oncogenic ER mutant: κB co-target genes normally activated by E1-liganded ER-WT
+/-NFκB in vitro, and ii) activate a more E1-ER-like oncogenic genes profile in ERY537S BC xenografts and PDX
than in ER-WT BC tumors in vivo. This will inform how ER target gene changes during the shift from high E2 to
high E1 after menopause might promote breast cancer development and may identify new therapeutic targets,
ultimately yielding new ER+ breast cancer therapies and prevention strategies."
11160296,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The Fred Hutch/University of Washington/Seattle Children’s Cancer Consortium (the Consortium) catchment
area includes all of Washington State (WA) and includes 7.6 million individuals, of whom 32.7% are from
minoritized racial/ethnic groups. 1.2% are American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN), who experience a
disproportionately high level of cancer incidence and mortality. While the 29 federally recognized Tribes in WA
represent diverse, culturally and contextually distinct communities, they share cultural resilience which offers a
stable foundation for addressing cancer disparities in partnership with the Consortium. The Consortium offers
innovative, novel approaches to addressing cancer prevention, treatment, and care. The Consortium’s Office of
Community Outreach and Engagement (OCOE) established the Indigenous Cancer Health Equity Initiative
(ICHE-i) program in 2022 to partner directly with AI/AN communities. Through Indigenous knowledge and value
systems, ICHE-i relies on the AI/AN centered approaches of relationality, sustainability, and holistic perspectives
to expand research capacity for Tribal, academic, and research partnerships. We propose to deepen Tribal
partnerships and strengthen connections to our Consortium to respectfully engage with Tribal communities in
support of cancer priorities and impactful cancer research while centering Tribal sovereignty. Reducing the
cancer burden among AI/AN people represent our primary mission, requiring improvements in access to cancer
screening, cancer care, and research in partnership with AI/AN communities. To eliminate cancer screening
disparities and heal distrust in cancer research with AI/AN people, our Community Engagement with Dialogue,
Advocacy, and Research (CEDAR) activities using community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles.
Through this project, we aim to:
Aim 1. Partner with AI/AN communities to support Tribal needs assessments, identify priorities, and
develop sustainable community and system-level changes.
Aim 2. Use an equitable, bidirectional approach to implement culturally grounded education, programs,
and medical care to reduce the cancer burden for AI/AN communities.
Aim 3. Coordinate engagement and dissemination activities with Tribal members, partner organizations,
relevant service organizations or policymakers, and the scientific community."
11160297,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) people have the highest rates of commercial cigarette smoking of any
racial/ethnic group in the US. Compared to other racial/ethnic groups, they have 6 times higher rates of
developing smoking-related cancers and are only half as likely to quit smoking. The result is that commercial
cigarette smoking now accounts for half of all deaths among AIAN communities nationwide. These dramatic
inequities are mainly due to two causes: (1) AIAN peoples’ lack of access to smoking cessation interventions,
and (2) the lack of efficacious smoking cessation interventions for AIAN populations. Addressing the dual
challenges of access and efficacy requires high-impact population-level interventions for smoking cessation.
Recent advances in large language model (LLM)-based smartphone app-delivered conversational chatbots offer
a promising solution, leveraging machine learning and natural language processing to emotionally engage users
and to provide personalized support and skills training. Chatbots can deliver supportive, empathic, and
personalized responses. To date, nothing is known about the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of chatbots
for helping AIAN people quit cigarette smoking. Regarding accessibility, chatbots require no in-person delivery
and no provider training, do not require integration into complex medical systems, can be freely accessed through
an app store, and are available at any time and any place. These smartphone-delivered chatbot apps have
potentially high population-level reach given that 68-78% of AIAN people own smartphones. We developed
“QuitBot” using an agile, user-centered design framework. QuitBot, the first-known chatbot with LLM-supported
conversation features, offers a comprehensive 42-day smoking cessation program. We initially assessed QuitBot
through a diary study, followed by a pilot RCT (N = 404), comparing it with the National Cancer Institute (NCI)’s
SmokefreeTXT program. The pilot RCT proved highly feasible with a 96% retention rate. QuitBot participants
interacted more frequently with their intervention and used it longer than SmokefreeTXT. Building on our
preliminary data, we propose to conduct a fully powered two-arm RCT comparing QuitBot (n = 386) to
SmokefreeTXT (n = 386) among nationally recruited AIAN participants in order to determine: (1) the efficacy of
QuitBot relative to SmokefreeTXT for biochemically verified 30-day point prevalence commercial cigarette
abstinence at 12 months post-randomization; (2) if QuitBot’s effect on 12-month smoking cessation is mediated
by therapeutic alliance and engagement. We will also (1) explore if key baseline factors moderate the primary
cessation outcome and (2) conduct qualitative interviews with QuitBot participants and Tribal partners, Tribal
organizations, urban Indian partner organizations, and other relevant organizations and policymakers in tobacco
control to identify barriers and facilitators to dissemination. This study will advance the fields of research on the
use of chatbots for smoking cessation and cancer prevention among the AIAN population nationwide."
11177226,"Project Summary/Abstract
Heterotopic ossification (HO) refers to extraskeletal pathological bone formation that occurs as a common
complication after injury or as a manifestation of particular genetic disorders. However, limited by poor
understanding of the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, there is currently no effective treatment and
surgical eviction often results in recurrence. The overall goal of the project is to investigate cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying HO initiation and expansion and identify potential treatment targets for genetic and
acquired HO. Our preliminary data suggests that in mouse models of progressive osseous heteroplasia (POH),
a human disease caused by null mutations in GNAS that encodes Gαs, progressive expansion of ectopic bone
was due to recruitment of surrounding wild-type cells. Mechanistically, Gnas-/- mesenchymal cells differentiate
into osteoblasts and recruit wild-type cells to form bone by activating YAP, a transcription factor that regulates
expression of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which encodes a secreted ligand in the Hh family. Secreted SHH further
induces YAP activation, thereby resulting in additional Shh expression and osteoblast differentiation in
surrounding wild type cells. In human samples with acquired HO, upregulated YAP and HH signaling were also
found, indicating the clinical importance of our findings. In our unpublished preliminary studies, we found
upregulated Wnt5a expression in Gnas-/- SMPs in vitro and in HO lesions of POH mouse models in vivo. WNT5a
not only regulates stem cell proliferation and enhances repopulation, but also plays an essential role in long bone
and cartilage development during embryogenesis. Importantly, we found that Wnt5a expression was also
controlled by YAP activation and was required for HO in both genetic and acquired HO. These findings lead to
a central hypothesis that YAP and WNT5a are activated in a positive feedback loop to recruit progenitor cells for
osteoblast differentiation in soft tissues, thereby promoting HO formation in both genetic and acquired HO mouse
models. We will test these hypotheses in three aims. The first aim is to clarify the relationship between YAP and
Wnt5a expression in ectopic bone formation in POH and test whether YAP and WNT5a interact in a positive
feedback loop. The second aim is to illuminate the molecular mechanism in response to YAP and WNT5a in
ectopic bone formation. The third aim is to investigate the contribution of WNT5a to ectopic bone formation in
fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) and trauma-induced HO models. Taken together, these proposed
studies will yield novel insights into a common cellular and molecular mechanism underlying initiation and
expansion of distinct HO forms and highlight the importance of rare genetic disease studies in identifying a
shared core pathological mechanism underlying a class of diseases."
11177233,"PROJECT 2: Summary/Abstract The ongoing WISDOM Study of risk-based versus annual breast cancer screening is one of the first-ever applications of population-wide genetic testing to inform breast cancer risk. Participants in the risk-based arm receive testing for rare pathogenic variants and common variants (e.g., single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs). The latter are used to calculate polygenic risk scores (PRS), which are used in combination with clinical risk models to inform screening and prevention recommendations. WISDOM is therefore an ideal setting to critically evaluate and accelerate the translation of PRS. Through our firsthand experience implementing PRS- based risk assessment in WISDOM, we have identified several key areas on which current PRSs need to improve: 1) their performance in non-European populations; 2) their ability to predict faster-growing cancers; and 3) their ability to identify women who may benefit from intensive screening. The overall goal of Project 2 is to advance breast cancer risk prediction by addressing these three gaps. In doing so, we aim to enhance the generalizability and clinical utility of breast cancer PRS. We will address the following Specific Aims: 1) Improve the cross-ancestry performance of breast cancer PRS; 2) Develop and validate a PRS for fast-growing breast cancers; and 3) Determine the risk of advanced cancer with annual versus biennial screening across levels of PRS. To bolster the impact and generalizability of our work, we will leverage our unique access to large, diverse datasets from publicly available resources, industry, and institutional cohorts. We have assembled an experienced, highly accomplished research team of experts in genetic epidemiology, biostatistical modeling, and breast cancer risk assessment and control. This project will eventually yield improved PRS’s for overall (Aim 1) and fast-growing breast cancer risk (Aim 2) to be implemented in the WISDOM Study and evaluated in tandem with clinical and mammographic artificial intelligence-based risk scores in Project 3. Together, this work will accelerate the evolution of breast cancer risk stratification to encompass the risk of fast vs slow-growing cancers. Moreover, our results (Aim 3) will directly inform modeling of mammography screening intervals by PRS in Project 4. These models and simulations are expected to improve the accuracy and clinical utility of the current WISDOM risk stratification engine. We expect these advancements will ultimately lead to safer, more effective risk-based screening."
11177237,"PROJECT 3: Summary The ongoing WISDOM risk-based breast cancer screening and prevention trial, which started in 2016, is a ground-breaking comparative effectiveness study to establish whether personalized breast cancer screening based on individual risk is non-inferior to annual screening in detecting advanced cancers, while reducing the potential harms of screening. However, the current WISDOM risk model has only moderate predictive power, which therefore offers high potential for improvement. Since the advent of the WISDOM trial, there have been substantial innovations in risk prediction: 1) deep-learning mammographic artificial intelligence (AI) methods can extract numerous mammographic features beyond breast density; 2) ongoing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have improved the understanding of genetic susceptibility for breast cancer subtypes and for populations of non-European descent; and 3) molecularly defined subtypes of fast- and slow-growing cancers are being used as more clinically relevant endpoints than the presence or absence of any breast cancer. The overall goal of Project 3 is to develop and improve integrated risk models combining advances in deep- learning mammographic AI, germline genetics, and clinical factors for predicting molecular subtypes of breast cancer. This next-generation predictive model will be incorporated into the ongoing WISDOM study platform for risk-based screening and prevention. We will achieve this through 3 Specific Aims: We will 1) Develop a deep-learning mammographic AI model to predict risk for molecular subtypes of fast- and slow-growing breast cancer in large, diverse cohorts; 2) Develop and validate the next-generation WISDOM risk model by combining the Aim 1 mammographic AI model and Project 2 polygenic risk score (PRS) model with the latest clinical risk models to predict risk for molecular subtypes of fast- and slow-growing breast cancer; and 3) Transfer this mammographic AI model from standard 2D mammography to newer 3D tomosynthesis in a diverse cohort. The Project 3 team has extensive expertise with developing integrated risk models. Furthermore, the research will benefit from access to 5 large, diverse study cohorts with >200,000 women with >14,000 breast cancer cases in which these risk features will be available. The final model will be used to update CISNET simulation model in Project 4 that will comprehensively estimate benefits, harms, costs, and health value outcomes from the developed models. Guided by the updated WISDOM simulation and multidisciplinary group consensus, Projects 3 and 4 will identify a unified risk-based approach to be implemented in the WISDOM study as the next-generation WISDOM risk platform. These new models and simulations are expected to substantially improve the accuracy and clinical utility of the current WISDOM risk model, enabling greater reductions in breast-cancer incidence, related morbidity and mortality, and harms related to over-screening."

Our society is becoming more and more sedentary, thereby worsening and accelerating the effects of aging. The
central system that is responsible for the beneficial effects of mobility on brain function, cardiac function,
metabolism, and other organs is the musculoskeletal system. Without muscle contraction and bone movement,
there is no exercise and therefore no beneficial effects on the organism. Exercise appears to delay the negative
effects of aging and can ameliorate negative effects of diseases associated with aging. Exercise maintains both
muscle and bone mass and it is most likely the maintenance of the health of the musculoskeletal system that is
responsible for the health of the organism. The hypothesis to be tested includes: Crosstalk occurs between
muscle and bone through systemic factors. The osteocyte is regulated by both mechanical loading and by factors
secreted by contracted muscle. In turn, the osteocyte regulates muscle myogenesis and function. Exercise
targets the osteocyte and muscle by reducing the negative effects of aging. The specific aims of this program
project renewal are 1). Determine how young and old osteocytes regulate myogenesis, muscle mass and
function, 2). Determine how muscle protects and maintains osteoblast/osteocyte viability and function,
3). Examine the role of extracellular vesicles in bone-muscle crosstalk, 4). Determine the role of
estrogen/β-catenin in muscle-bone crosstalk with aging and 5). Determine if exercise can rescue or
reduce the negative effects of aging on bone-muscle crosstalk. These specific aims will be accomplished
through a multidisciplinary approach where bone and muscle biologists interact along with engineers and
biochemists. This program project focuses on bone-muscle crosstalk utilizing muscle and bone transgenic
mouse models, unique bone and muscle cell lines, live cell imaging and intravital imaging capabilities and
integration of metabolomics and lipidomics. The projects and their supporting cores are highly integrative and
will lead to synergistic interactions where the potential for progress and success is greater than the individual
components. Identification of the mechanisms used by muscle and bone to communicate and regulate the
musculoskeletal system as a whole and how these are regulated by exercise should lead to interventions for
musculoskeletal disease, dysfunction, and disorders and prevent the negative effects of immobilization and
aging, not only on the musculoskeletal system, but on the overall health of the individual."

11083181,"During sleep, the mammalian brain alternates between two major brain states, rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM
(NREM) sleep. Recent work showed that the electroencephalogram (EEG) during NREM sleep in both
humans and mice exhibits a pronounced infraslow (~50s) modulation in the sigma (10-15 Hz) power range Transitions
from NREM to REM sleep and spontaneous awakenings are synchronized with this infraslow o power (ISP) rhythm,
suggesting that it plays a crucial role in shaping sleep architecture and influencing sleep quality. Yet, the
mechanisms underlying the generation of infraslow rhythms remain largely unknown. Importantly, the ISP rhythm
also strongly modulates the activity of neurons in REM sleep-regulatory brain areas including the locus coeruleus
(LC), dorsomedial medulla (dmM), periaqueductal gray (PAG), and dorsal raphe (DR). However, current models of
sleep regulation lack this prominent infraslow rhythm, and a functional understanding of its impacts on sleep
architecture therefore remains elusive. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the dmM controls the ISP
rhythm through its interactions with the LC and that infraslow fluctuations in the activity of DR/PAG neurons control
the stability of NREM sleep and consequently gate transitions to REM sleep. The specific aims combine
experimental studies and biophysical computational modeling to determine mechanisms governing the ISP rhythm,
and to understand the consequences of this rhythm on sleep architecture, particularly NREM--+REM transitions. In
AIM 1, we will perform Neuropixels recordings along with optogenetic manipulation to identify how network
interactions between dmM and LC neurons regulate the ISP rhythm In parallel, we will develop computational
models informed by recorded data to identify underlying mechanisms of infraslow rhythm generation in the dmM-LC
circuit In AIM 2 we will conduct Neuropixels recordings to identify the functional connectivity among different
subclasses of DR/PAG neurons. By optogenetically blocking external infraslow inputs to the DR/PAG and
conducting behavioral REM sleep deprivation, we will probe how the infraslow rhythmicity and REM sleep pressure
affect the dynamics in the DR/PAG network and state transitions. In parallel, we will construct computational models
informed by the recorded data to identify the dynamic interactions among different DR/PAG neuron subclasses and
to analyze the effects of infraslow activity and REM sleep pressure on simulated sleep architecture. Our studies will
bridge a fundamental gap in our understanding of how the mammalian brain generates infraslow
rhythms. Furthermore, results will identify targets for enhancing the ISP rhythm to test its impact on sleep quality,
and will lay the groundwork to develop complementary and integrative health approaches to leverage infraslow brain
dynamics to promote healthy sleep and thus physiological and emotional well-being."
11083227,"Resiliency to stress is crucial to the health of individuals and of society. While the detrimental effects of
prolonged stress are well-documented, there remains a critical knowledge gap regarding the mechanisms
underlying individual resilience to adverse outcomes. The circuits underlying stress resiliency, and how
resilient individuals tap into these circuits to maintain normal behavioral function, are not fully understood.
Furthermore, resiliency occurs over both long and short timescales and likely emerges from interactions
across neural subsystems that span molecules to whole-brain connectivity. To unravel these complex
mechanisms, we will use a multidisciplinary approach that combines time course experiments, machine
learning, signal processing, and statistical inference to integrate multidimensional data from the
transcriptome to the whole-brain connectome to characterize how circuit activity gives rise to resiliency.
We will collect behavioral, neuroimaging, electrophysiological, gene expression, and biomarker data from
well-validated mouse models of resilience. We will also develop new computational tools to characterize
the multiscale network dynamics of genes, molecules, and circuits that underlie the neurobiological
substrates of resilience. We will validate these relationships in another mouse strain to determine the
specificity of our model. This will be the first study to provide a comprehensive understanding of
interactions between neural circuits and their molecular, genomic, and neuroanatomical contexts in animal
models of resilience. If successful, our findings could yield insights into unifying principles of how neural
mechanisms interact to generate behavioral phenotypes."
11168263,"ABSTRACT
Half of the spinal cord injury (SCI) individuals experience weight gain attributed to increased adiposity.
Following SCI, increased lipid deposition is also observed in other organs including the liver, heart and skeletal
muscle. Accumulating evidence indicates that pathological expansion of adipose tissue and ectopic lipid
accumulation increases the risk of cardiometabolic disorders including hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin
resistance. Under physiological conditions, an excess of energy is stored in adipose tissue in the form of
triglycerides. During energy deprivation, the adipose tissue mobilizes triglycerides into fatty acids via lipolysis,
and these are used as fuel for brown adipose tissue, heart, liver, and muscle. When energy balance becomes
dysregulated, ectopic accumulation of lipids in the liver and muscle as well as unresolved inflammation in
adipose tissue contribute to insulin resistance. Whether the underlying cause of metabolic complications after
SCI may be linked to adipose tissue dysfunction is unclear. Also unknown are the mechanisms that cause or
contribute to pathophysiological changes in white adipose tissue (WAT) structure and function after SCI. The
sympathetic nervous system and sensory neurons with cell bodies located in dorsal root ganglia (DRG)
innervate WAT. Whereas the contribution of sympathetic innervation to WAT function has been characterized,
the extent to which sensory innervation drives WAT function under normal and pathophysiological conditions
has remained elusive. We and others have demonstrated a remarkable convergence between neuronal
circuits' structural and functional organization and expression of α2δ subunits of voltage-gated calcium
channels (VGCC). α2δ subunits positively regulate synaptic transmission by increasing plasma membrane
expression of VGCC. However, these subunits may also play a pathological role following neuronal injury. Our
preliminary data suggest that SCI exacerbates lipolysis in epididymal (e)WAT and that α2δ1 expression
increases after a thoracic SCI in calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) DRG neurons that project to eWAT.
Concurrently, we found elevated CGRP content in eWAT and increased expression of the CGRP receptor
RAMP1 in eWAT seven days after SCI. Not only does CGRP activate lipolysis independent of sympathetic
drive, but it also acts as a potent vasodilator. Changes in adipose tissue microcirculation have been associated
with health complications including adiposity and altered metabolism. Accordingly, experiments in Aim 1 will
evaluate the extent to which α2δ1 silencing and pharmacological blockade normalize eWAT function after SCI.
Aim 2 will dissect the cellular mechanism underlying α2δ1-dependent changes in eWAT lipolysis. Aim 3 will
explore the role of vascular cells in eWAT dysfunction and inflammation after SCI. Successful completion of the
proposed study may provide novel insight into molecular causes and mechanistic underpinning of maladaptive
sensory processing and WAT function after SCI, facilitating the development of strategies targeting WAT
function to reduce metabolic and cardiovascular complications after SCI."
11168261,"MSA is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the accumulation and aggregation of
misfolded forms of the protein alpha-synuclein (α-syn) in oligodendrogila. In addition to neurodegeneration,
demyelination, and autonomic dysfunction, recent work has highlighted a key role for the immune system in the
pathophysiology of disease. In postmortem MSA brains, we found α-syn pathology is accompanied by HLA-DR+
(MHCII) reactive microglia, increased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, and infiltration of peripheral
lymphocytes. While inflammation has been reported in human disease and in animal models, it is currently
unknown specifically what immune-mediated mechanisms are critical to disease pathogenesis and whether
targeting those mechanisms are protective.
 Utilizing a novel viral vector that selectively targets oligos (Olig001-SYN) in mice, my lab found that α-
syn overexpression in oligodendrocytes induces robust neuroinflammation similar to that seen in MSA patients.
To determine if the adaptive immune system plays a disease driving role in MSA pathology, we genetically and
pharmacologically inhibited CD4+ T cell infiltration and effector function in mice transduced with Olig001-SYN.
We found that modulating T-cell trafficking and cytokine expression attenuated neuroinflammation and
demyelination in the CNS, suggesting antigen-specific T cell responses are required for disease. These results
indicate that targeting the immune system in MSA is disease modifying, at least in model systems, and
represents a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention. A critical next step is identifying cell-specific
pathways for potential disease interventions.
 The overall goal of the work proposed in this renewal application is to utilize genetic, and discovery-based
approaches to isolate and selectively target disease driving immune pathways in a preclinical model of MSA.
Given the role of CD4 T cells in many immune processes including microglial activation, cytokine responses in
the CNS, and B cell maturation, it is important to determine the mechanisms and timing of CD4 T cell activation
and the nature of the underlying antigens that are specifically active in MSA. CD4 T cell activation is likely to
involve CNS resident macrophages, which are important for recruiting CD4 T cells to the CNS, and to engage
downstream B cell effector functions. Based on this, we will test the hypothesis that abnormal α-syn expression
in oligodendrocytes drives enhanced adaptive immune responses through activation of CNS resident
macrophages (Aim 1), and that this activation leads to antigen specific T (Aim 2) and B cell responses (Aim 3)
resulting in harmful neuroinflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration in MSA.
 Currently there are no available therapies that slow or halt disease progression. Long term, we hope the
results from these research studies will show where to target disease-modifying therapies in the pre-clinical
space and will also be important for studying immune responses in other synucleinopathy disease models."
11168260,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genetic generalized epilepsies (GGE) are the major subtype of epilepsy syndromes, accounting for about 40%
of U.S. cases. Contrary to popular belief, over one-third of GGE cases that persist into adulthood live with
uncontrolled seizure activity and neurocognitive impairments, negatively impacting quality of life and leading to
higher-than-expected risk of death. Despite the urgent need for new treatment options, development of effective
anti-seizure medications has largely stalled over the past decade, as research is mainly centered on rodent
models that fail to manifest the complex symptomology and recapitulate the polygenic etiology that underlies
human GGE. As such, alternative approaches are needed to advance the field of epilepsy research, including
animal models that are more congruent to the human condition. The baboon represents one such alternative, as
it resembles humans more closely than rodent strains – genetically, physiologically, and (neuroanatomically) –
and presents naturally occurring, highly heritable GGE, with strong electroclinical similarities with human
epilepsy. Our primary objective in this study is to robustly characterize the genetic and transcriptomic architecture
of epilepsy in baboons and develop an in vitro model, based on induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived
cerebral organoids, that recapitulates molecular signatures observed in human epilepsy.
We will achieve this through the following integrated aims: (1) identify epilepsy-risk variants across the baboon
genome, including targeted examinations of human candidate gene homologs, and characterize biological
pathways enriched with potential risk genes; (2) quantify gene and miRNA expression levels in epileptic and
healthy baboon brains through single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-Seq) and identify genetic-transcriptomic
associations involving risk variants, such as our recently implicated RBFOX1, as well as wider perturbations in
co-expression networks; and (3) generate primary and CRISPR-edited isogenic cerebral organoids derived from
epileptic and healthy baboons to assess the effect of RBFOX1 perturbations on the transcriptional landscape
and synaptic function, and explore potential mechanisms for restoration of synaptic function in epilepsy. The
results of this study will be the first necessary step in establishing a novel in vivo and in vitro preclinical platform
for therapeutic discovery that is based on non-human organoids. With a high incidence of new GGE cases in
our studied baboon colony, large-scale investigations can be initiated and maintained, allowing for a vertically
integrated pipeline from epileptic animal to manipulated organoid systems that can interrogate the etiological
architecture of epilepsy from a multi-omic perspective. This includes whole genome sequencing, snRNA-Seq,
epigenomic and proteomic profiling, neuroimaging, and electroencephalography, as well as more invasive
investigations of the epileptic brain that are not feasible or are limited in human cohorts, creating a unique
research platform that can inform, complement, and support findings from human-based epilepsy studies."
11168262,"Project Summary
In the somatosensory system, the detection of external signals, such as mechanical, thermal, and chemical stimuli, is
critical for survival. Cutaneous nerve endings sense these changes in the environment, conveying this information first to
the spinal cord via specialized sensory afferents that can discriminate between innocuous and noxious stimuli, the
latter by pain-sensing nociceptors. The sensations and the physiological effects of cold are distinct among somatosensory
modalities in that cold provides a pleasant, soothing sensation at mild temperatures, but is also agonizing as temperatures
decrease. The menthol receptor, TRPM8 is the principal cold sensor in mammalian sensory neurons. This and cells
expressing the ion channel are required for the sensations of both innocuous cool and noxious cold, heightened cold
sensitivity that results with injury or disease and, paradoxically, the ability of cooling to relieve chronic pain and itch.
These findings suggest that TRPM8 can centrally differentiate and propagate the distinct percepts of pleasant and
therapeutic cooling from painful and aggravating sensations of cold. But how does this lone channel and the cells
expressing it mediate these diverse physiological effects? We found that the glial cell-line derived neurotrophic
factor-like ligand artemin (ARTN) and its receptor GFRα3 are required for injury-induced, TRPM8-dependent cold pain,
the first evidence of a molecule that directly sensitizes cold in vivo. While the cellular and molecular transduction
mechanisms used by this signaling complex to induce cold pain have yet to be defined, these findings point to the
cohort of TRPM8+ afferents that express GFRa3 as cold nociceptors. We propose a model whereby injury of any
etiology leads to cold allodynia via peripheral release of ARTN that acts on GFRa3 receptors on TRPM8 cells to increase
their sensitivity to cold, transmitting this centrally via distinct neurocircuits. We propose to test this first by
determining the cellular basis for ARTN and GFRα3 mediated cold sensitization. Second, we have generated a novel
mouse genetic strategy to target the GFRa3+ and GFRa3- populations of TRPM8 afferents, allowing the lab to
differentially study these two cell types and determine their necessity for acute cold signaling, for pathological cold pain,
and for analgesic and anti-pruritic cooling in vivo. Lastly, it is critical to unbiasedly identify cold-tuned spinal cells to
determine how the pleasant and painful aspects of cold are processed. We have adapted an innovative genetic approach to
study cold-tuned spinal neurons molecularly, functionally, and behaviorally, allowing us to critically interrogate the
processing of peripheral cold signals at this first important site for conveying somatosensory and nociceptive information.
These studies will define the signal transduction pathways of cold and cold pain, providing not only insights into
somatosensory signaling and the mechanisms that bring about pain associated with this modality, but also potential
therapeutic interventions that use cold as a stimulus."
11168301,"Imbalance contributes to falls, fall risk increases with age, and falls cause accidental death and injury. While
causes of falls and imbalance are multifactorial, modern multivariate statistical analyses allow us to quantify the
impact of age-related vestibular declines on falls as well as the impact of age-related vestibular declines on age-
related balance declines. For example, we have recently reported that nearly 50% of cross-sectional age-related
balance declines found using a standard Romberg test variant (“eyes closed; standing on foam”) are mediated
by an age-related increase in roll tilt thresholds, suggesting that a single sub-clinical facet of vestibular function
is a substantial contributor to age-related balance declines. Furthermore, an analysis of over 5,000 Americans
showed that individuals who failed to complete this same balance test condition had significantly increased odds
to have reported “difficulty with falling” in the past 12 months (odds ratio of 6.3). We propose to build upon these
findings to quantify the multiple links between aging, vestibular function, balance, and falls. We posit the following
links: (i) vestibular function declines with age, (ii) these age-related vestibular declines impact balance, (iii)
imbalance contributes to falls, and (iv) falls cause death and injuries. Specifically, we posit that correlations
between aging, vestibular function, and balance arise, in part, because vestibular imprecision (i.e., vestibular
thresholds or vestibular “noise”) increases with age as demonstrated by large increases in vestibular thresholds
above the age of 40. Increased vestibular imprecision, in turn, contributes to instability, which contributes to falls.
To quantify these correlations and hypothesized causal links, we propose comprehensive assays of vestibular
function, broad multi-faceted balance assays, as well as reports of falls. We also propose to further develop and
test candidate interventions designed to improve tilt thresholds (“vestibular precision”), which could also improve
balance and reduce falls. Given life-or-death significance and broad impact, we propose:
 Aim 1: To quantify the links between age, vestibular function, balance, and falls in healthy individuals using
a comprehensive vestibular function test battery, broad multi-faceted balance tests, & fall-related surveys.
 Aim 2: To quantify both tilt thresholds and balance before and after a training intervention that has subjects
performing a standard tilt threshold task, except that feedback (“correct” or ”incorrect”) is provided after each
trial. This task is designed to improve vestibular thresholds (“precision”), which may also improve balance. For
Aim 2A, we propose to test young adults (age 18-40). For Aim 2B, we propose to test older adults (age 65-89).
 Aim 1 will quantify links between vestibular function and falls for the first time and will also quantify new links
between vestibular function and balance. This will define potential vestibular and/or balance tests that can be
used as screening tests to determine who would benefit from intervention. Aim 2 will quantify the impacts of a
training paradigm designed to reduce tilt thresholds. This will develop and test an intervention designed to
improve vestibular precision, which could also improve balance and reduce falls."
11139198,"Oral cancer is the 6th most common cancer, mostly tongue oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Surgery and
radiation treatments result in severe quality of life issues, tissue stiffness and metastasis. Lysyl oxidase (LOX)
is one of five paralogues. All catalyze the final extracellular enzymatic reaction required for collagen biosynthesis.
Only LOX undergoes biosynthetic processing to release the active enzyme and the unique 18 kDa lysyl oxidase
propeptide (LOX-PP) that inhibits tumor growth. Preliminary data show that a polymorphic point mutation in the
LOX-PP region of LOX gene leading to R to Q amino acid change in LOX-PP is linked to increased OSCC. We
further show that wildtype LOX-PP cross-talks with macrophages to shift phenotype to inflammatory tumor
suppressive cells. In lesion microenvironments in 4NQO induced oral cancer WT mice exhibit tumor suppressive-
T cell markers, while knockin Q LOX-PP (KI) mice show tumor cells. We published that LOX-PP, but not
polymorphic Q LOX-PP, inhibits FGFR signaling, and that LOX-PP can bind directly to FGFR1. In non-oral
cancers immunosuppressive macrophages overexpress FGF-2 and FGFR1 and FGF-2 regulates conversion to
tumor suppressive cells in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, LOX enzymes from all 5 paralogues can be up-
regulated, including in OSCC, to promote fibrosis. Integrating these findings, we propose that in OSCC
microenvironments, the polymorphic Q LOX-PP has lost its tumor suppressor function via its inability to block
FGFR-dependent macrophage phenotype swich to pro-inflammatory tumor suppressive with consequences on
T cell activation and OSCC outcomes. To investigate the hypothesis that LOX-PP regulation of macrophage
phenotype contributes to OSCC tumor suppression that is lost in Q LOX-PP we propose 3 Aims. In Aim 1a we
will investigate in tumor microenvironments vs adjacent regions macrophage phenotypes and local modulations
of T cell and mesenchymal cell type and gene expression changes utilizing state of the art spatial transcriptomics
technologies in WT compared to KI mice in the 4NQO model of cancer. The 4NQO model mimics human OSCC
development. Pathways will be validated in vitro and in vivo. In Aim 1b we will determine the relative ability of
recombinant WT R LOX-PP vs Q LOX-PP to block oral cancer development in mice. In Aim 1c we will investigate
human cancer tissues for the same pathway differences in clinical samples from oral cancer subjects with WT
and variant LOX genotype. Aim 2a will determine differential effects and regulatory mechanisms of WT vs variant
LOX-PP on macrophages in vitro. In Aim 2b we will perform a loss of function study of secreted FGF-2 KO mice
that may have rescued OSCC response to 4NQO in LOX-PP KI mice. In Aim 2c we investigate the ability of
local wildtype AAV LOX-PP injection in KI mice with or without a LOX enzyme inhibitor (PXS-5505) to determine
additive or synergistic benefits in 4NQO induced OSCC. In Aim 3 we will determine affinity of LOX-PP and Q
LOX-PP to FGFR1 in vitro, and perform structure-function studies, and identify functional direct LOX-PP binding
partners. Data will provide functional targets of LOX-PP in oral cancer tumor suppression."

11175781,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite decades of research documenting the benefits of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy,
this highly effective treatment is not initiated, implemented, or persistently used by the millions of adults
worldwide diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). An estimated 16% of patients refuse CPAP after a
single night’s use, 29-83% do not adhere to current CPAP recommendations, and up to 50% abandon CPAP
after one year. Untreated OSA is associated with a range of distressing symptoms, dangerous comorbid
conditions, billions in healthcare spending, and higher all-cause mortality. Growing evidence shows that older
adults, people with low socioeconomic status, and certain racial/ethnic minority groups are at higher risk for
developing OSA, less likely to adhere to CPAP therapy, and experience worse outcomes than other groups.
Other variables associated with CPAP non-adherence are commonly experienced CPAP side effects, knowledge
deficits, low levels of self-efficacy, motivation, and confidence, and fragmented healthcare delivery. A variety of
educational, supportive, behavioral, and mixed interventions have been tested in randomized controlled trials
(RCTs). While each of these intervention types has demonstrated efficacy to varying degrees, key knowledge
gaps remain as to: (1) which intervention type leads to the greatest improvements in long-term CPAP adherence
and clinical outcomes; (2) who benefits most from a given intervention; and (3) what duration and/or sequence
of interventions is required to effectively induce behavior change. Collectively, these gaps suggest the need for
the development and testing of adaptive interventions aimed at improving CPAP adherence. Adaptive
interventions capitalize on differences in how patients respond to intervention by providing appropriate
modifications for those who need them and when they need them. To our knowledge, no fully powered RCTs
have tested the effectiveness of adaptive interventions aimed at increasing CPAP adherence. Project objective:
is to evaluate a telehealth-delivered adaptive intervention for persons newly diagnosed with OSA that promotes
CPAP adherence and improves health outcomes and assess potential mediators and moderators of treatment
response. Aim 1: Compare effects of motivational enhancement, device support, and standard care on primary
and secondary outcomes at 3 mo. Aim 2: Determine which behavioral change treatment is most efficacious at
promoting primary and secondary outcomes in participants who respond and do not respond to initial treatment
at 6 and 12 mo. Aim 3. Assess if CPAP adherence is mediated by stage of change, self-efficacy, knowledge,
and/or confidence and moderated by social economic status, race, and sex at 3 mo. By using an innovative
adaptive design and telehealth-delivered approach, study results will directly lead to a more personalized
approach to increasing long-term CPAP adherence and improving health outcomes of persons with OSA while
simultaneously generating a better understanding of factors that drive CPAP adherence across a variety of
personal, social, and economic contextual factors."

Cold exposure increases thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and improves systemic glucose and lipid metabolism. Thermogenesis is an energy-demanding process that relies on enhanced blood flow as well as uptake of fuels, processes that are triggered by sympathetic nervous system signaling. Thus, these parameters are often considered interchangeably when assessing the potential metabolic benefits of stimulating BAT in humans. And yet, there are conditions like diabetes where BAT thermogenic activity and glucose uptake are dissociated. A critical gap in the field stems from the consideration of sympathetic inputs to BAT as homogeneous, when it is well-established that perivascular sympathetic neurons (PVSNBAT) that project along blood vessels to innervate the organ parenchyma are molecularly and electrophysiologically distinct from vascular sympathetic neurons (VSNBAT) that innervate the vasculature. We developed a toolkit that includes novel mouse genetic and chemogenetic tools, improved imaging techniques and in vivo assays to parse the functions of projections from distinct subpopulations of sympathetic neurons to BAT. Chemogenetic stimulation of PVSNBAT increases blood flow and thermogenesis, while activating VSNBAT influences systemic glucose metabolism without altering blood flow. This was unexpected, as VSNs elsewhere in the body regulate vasoconstriction and vasodilation.
The proposed studies utilize our new tools to explore the hypothesis that VSNBAT signals confer protection from obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction and to uncover the mechanisms regulating these effects. Bridge funds will be used to sustain our workforce and to begin loss-of-function studies to evaluate the contribution of VSNBAT to systemic glucose metabolism in the lean and obese condition."

Despite significant advances in the understanding of the neurobiology of alcohol use disorder (AUD), there is a
gap in the translation of these insights into clinical applications. Translational research in AUD is facilitated by
the use of experimental manipulations and theoretical constructs that can be studied across species. Towards
advancing translational research in AUD, the PI completed an Exploratory/Developmental Project entitled:
“Modeling alcohol reward and reinforcement in the human laboratory” (R21 AA022752). The objective was to
develop and test a translational task of motivation for alcohol in humans. To do so, we combined alcohol
challenge with progressive ratio self-administration methodologies. Alcohol was administered intravenously
using the Computer-Assisted Self-Infusion of Ethanol (CASE) system. At BrAC = 0.06 g/dl, participants
completed a progressive ratio self-administration task in which they were allowed to work to be infused more
alcohol following a progressive ratio schedule. The alcohol self-administration task captures motivation for
alcohol and mirrors preclinical methodologies, ideal for testing of translational hypotheses. In addition to
developments in the “outcome side” of the modeling approach, the “predictor side” comprised of AUD
phenomenology has progressed towards clinical translation. The Addiction Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA)
proposed to parse AUD phenomenology into three domains, namely incentive salience, negative emotionality,
and executive dysfunction. Our research group has recently provided an independent replication of the ANA
framework in a sample of 1,679 heavy drinkers. Together with the innovation in outcome assessment (i.e.,
progressive ratio self-administration in humans), the ANA framework can inform staging of AUD progression
and as such, motivation for alcohol in humans provides an ideal behavioral science outcome. The proposed
R01 application builds upon the extensive work from our laboratory on the development of a translational task
for drinking motivation in humans. It does so by testing the three dimensions of the ANA for their effects on
alcohol motivation in individuals with AUD."
11083190,"Vocal communication is a critical component of the social behavior of many species, including humans.
Communication sound (vocalizations or ‘calls’) recognition is a computationally challenging problem
because calls are produced with immense variability across individuals and contexts. Our previous
research showed that call categorization, a first step in call recognition, can be accomplished by detecting
informative features of intermediate complexity in calls. Such feature selectivity likely arises in the
superficial layers of the primary auditory cortex (A1). Whether this feature detection strategy is conserved
across vocal mammals, and how neural feature selectivity develops with learning, remain unknown. This
proposal aims to answer these questions by developing a cross-species (rodents vs. primates) and
cross-level (behavioral, neural, computational) approach. In Aim 1, we will first determine whether the
selective encoding of intermediate complexity features, which we have shown to be a successful strategy
for rodent (guinea pig, GP) call categorization, is also adopted in non-human primates (marmoset
monkeys, MM). Then, using high channel count probe recordings from A1 of GPs and MMs, we will
construct network models to determine how neural receptive fields that are selective for call features can
be assembled from frequency-tuned inputs. We will compare the two species’ network models to derive
general principles of the neural circuits underlying call categorization. In Aim 2, we will train adult GPs and
MMs to categorize calls from the other species (heterospecific calls). We will determine whether
feature-selective responses to heterospecific calls emerge post-training in GPs and MMs during behavior
and the network connectivity underlying this new selectivity. Finally, we will quantify the similarities in
representation and functional network connectivity between learned and possibly innate sound categories.
These data will be used to develop a unified model for call categorization that is generalizable across
species and contexts. The proposed activities will provide insight into the neural encoding of
communication sounds, bridging behavioral, algorithmic, and mechanistic levels. The impact of this work
will be maximized through sharing of data in standardized formats, and rigorous, transparent model
validation."

11081826,"Our LONG-TERM GOAL is to extend current biological and artificial vision research from a focus on 2D 
image recognition toward visual understanding of 3D structure in the real world. 3D object perception is the 
essence of real-world vision, underlying the “thousand words” of information the brain generates about 
precise object geometry on large and fine scales, structural design, mechanics, material composition, 
biological morphology and functionality, physical state, pose, mass distribution, balance/support against 
gravity, potential for movement from passive falling/rolling to self-generated motion and complex interactive 
behaviors, age, beauty, damage, value, etc.
 Our first AIM is to use artificial vision networks to decipher brain algorithms underlying biological 3D 
vision. We will train novel, analyzable network architectures developed for 3D vision by the Yuille lab, to 
replicate 3D shape tuning functions of individual neurons recorded in the Connor lab, from successive 
stages of object processing in macaque monkeys: area V4, posterior inferotemporal cortex (PIT) and 
anterior inferotemporal cortex (AIT). The Connor and Yuille labs will analyze the 3D shape processing 
algorithms learned by these neuron-trained networks (NTNs), tracing the pathways of information from V1-
like 2D Gabor filters in layer 1 to the output neuron response, using a novel method for back-tracing the 
sources of excitatory and inhibitory signals through the network.
 Our second AIM is to develop artificial networks that implement biological algorithms to achieve humanlevel 3D visual performance. The Yuille lab will build on preliminary work proving the potential of novel 
network architectures performing analysis-by-synthesis with Neural Textured Deformable Meshes 
(NTDMs). These networks are designed for internal reconstruction of and high-level inference from 3D 
shape in natural scenes. The Connor lab will use components of these networks, in addition to more 
standard architectures like AlexNet, to train using neural responses (AIM 1). The trained network 
components and algorithms deciphered from them (AIM 1) will be incorporated by the Yuille lab into their 
evolving NTDM network designs to search for higher performance on larger 3D shape domains under a 
variety of real-world viewing conditions. Training and testing in larger 3D shape domains will depend on a 
unlimited photorealistic 3D ground truth-parameterized stimuli produced by genetic algorithms developed

11082650,"Our brain's ability to instantly recognize an object within a visual scene is almost effortless, yet obtaining 
this ability in artificial visual systems has taken decades. This is because the brain's computations that 
transform a visual scene into a neural code remain hidden among the billions of neurons and synaptic 
connections that make up the human visual system. Identifying and understanding these computations is 
the first step in providing clinical diagnoses and treatments for diseases and disorders disrupting visual 
processing, ranging from transient motion sickness to neurodegenerative disorders such as posterior 
cortical atrophy. Such treatments may involve visual prostheses to replace or bypass damaged 
computations (e.g., those involved in motion processing or face detection). Decades of experiments and 
modeling have uncovered fundamental computations in early visual cortex (retina, LGN, V1), but our 
knowledge of spatial feature processing (shapes, textures, colors) and temporal processing (motion, 
changing perspective) in higher-order visual cortex (e.g., areas V4 and IT) remains limited. This proposed 
research program aims to characterize the neural computations involved in how visual cortical area V4 
neurons respond to dynamic video clips. We will build a computational model that accurately predicts 
temporal V4 responses and interrogate this model to isolate the model circuits that govern the temporal 
integration of visual features. To optimize the parameters of our deep neural network model, we will 
combine data collection and model training in a closed loop: We train our model after each recording and 
choose the next video clips to present based on the model's uncertainty. In other words, we keep refining 
our working hypothesis---a deep neural network model---through model-guided data collection. The result 
of this procedure will be a large-scale dataset of temporal V4 responses to natural video clips as well as a 
highly-predictive computational model. We will use this model to test whether feature attention 
dynamically modulates V4 responses, linking temporal feature integration to behavior. Overall, this 
innovative closed-loop approach, requiring close interdisciplinary collaboration between experimental and

Mitigation of these gaps requires additional dedicated resources and staffing. This supplement is designed to enact a comprehensive plan to address these gaps in a timely manner within the HBCD Administrative Core. The supplement will provide support for three key components of such a plan: 1) Enhancement of the Study Navigator Program in HBCD to support faculty level leadership to formally evaluate and recommend revisions to the Navigator protocol; to ensure that each recruitment site supports at least one dedicated Navigator; and to formalize core training components for the program, 2) Improvement in oversight and efficiency of the Spanish Language and Culture components of the study across all domains by supporting
a faculty level Spanish Language and Culture Committee Chair, and by providing centralized coordination and consistency of translation services across all study components to improve accuracy, equity and inclusion, 3) Acceleration of recruitment overall and in specific target demographics to achieve study objectives at the site level by identifying and evaluating success of novel recruitment strategies and venues. Successful completion of these aims will ensure that the HBCD Study enters into the second phase of longitudinal follow-up with a strong foundation in terms of the overall sample characteristics, and participant support in terms of retention.

11168277,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cell to cell communication is critical for function in all multicellular organisms. A key factor for intercellular
communication is regulation by Ca2+ concentration. Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a
Ca2+ sensitive enzyme that is encoded by four genes in mammals: α, β, γ, and δ. There is an incredible amount
of diversity generated from the four vertebrate CaMKII genes. Alternative splicing produces up to 386 transcripts,
which leads to the production of 386 proteins that are then differentially post-translationally modified, and mix to
form hetero-oligomeric complexes, ultimately culminating in thousands of chemically distinct CaMKII
proteoforms. We are specifically interested in the crucial roles CaMKII plays in long-term memory formation
(neurons: α, β), fertilization (oocytes: γ), and cardiac physiology (cardiomyocytes: δ). Intriguingly, these cells all
communicate using Ca2+ oscillations but on vastly different timescales (minutes to milliseconds). How does one
enzyme accommodate this multifunctionality? We hypothesize that selective splicing and modification creates a
unique set of CaMKII variants expressed in specific cell types, thereby leading to differential functional outputs.
Fully elucidating these complex biological roles requires a deeper understanding of CaMKII variation at the
sequence and protein level, structural and conformational ramifications of these variations, and how these
variables affect CaMKII interactions within the cell. In this proposal, we seek to expand our understanding of
CaMKII function inside cells using a combinatorial approach of sequencing, biochemistry, structural biology, and
cellular assays. Completion of the proposed work will allow us to uncover the molecular basis for the many roles
of CaMKII in neurons, cardiomyocytes, and oocytes – with far-reaching implications on therapeutic intervention
for neurologic disease, cardiac dysfunction, and infertility."

11175783,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Exercise is a powerful strategy to improve skeletal muscle metabolism that can both prevent and reverse
disease. However, the complex signaling that drives the immediate and long-term changes in muscle metabolism
is incompletely understood. Skeletal muscle consists of multiple cell types, such as myocytes, vascular
endothelial cells, pericytes, and immune cells. When subjected to exercise stress, these cells communicate with
one another to coordinate the heightened energy production required by the skeletal muscle. Our long-term goal
is to understand intercellular skeletal muscle signaling initiated in response to exercise, thus informing strategies
to promote health and prevent disease.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are molecules known for their ability to both initiate signaling cascades and to
cause damage. Skeletal muscle produces ROS in response to exercise, but whether ROS harm or protect the
muscle has been debated. Initially, ROS were believed to be solely deleterious, contributing to conditions like
diabetes and sarcopenia. However, recent findings indicate that ROS play a crucial role in skeletal muscle's
metabolic adaptation to exercise. Despite this, we still have limited knowledge about where ROS are produced,
the enzymes involved, and the specific processes that rely on ROS for beneficial signaling during exercise.
Building on our previous research, our current proposal focuses on NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), a ROS-producing
enzyme we identified as a critical factor in initiating skeletal muscle's metabolic responses to exercise.
Importantly, this enzyme is most highly expressed in the vascular endothelial cells of skeletal muscle. If we
remove this enzyme from only the endothelium, we observe a reduced metabolic response to acute exercise.
Based on these findings, we will investigate the hypothesis that endothelial signaling, dependent on NOX4,
plays a crucial role in determining the mitochondrial metabolic responses to exercise in skeletal muscle.
To investigate this, we will utilize advanced tools that allow us to specifically manipulate the expression of Nox4
in endothelial cells. This will enable us to gain new insights into exercise-induced endothelial signaling and
examine the impact of endothelial cell-derived ROS on both 1) endothelial signaling and 2) the mitochondrial
responses to exercise in skeletal muscle. Ultimately, we hope these findings will contribute to developing
targeted exercise interventions and potentially provide a foundation for treatment strategies based on exercise
as medicine."
11175785,"Our pioneering studies have shown that robust expression of HIF-1 allows NP cells to maintain their metabolism
and bioenergetic needs in the hypoxic intervertebral disc. The application is based on the recent observation that
dysregulation of HIF-1-dependent lactate export through a lactate efflux channel, MCT4 dramatically
influenced NP cell metabolism and promoted disc degeneration in MCT4-KO mice. We also found that the HIF-
1-dependent glucose importer GLUT1 is redundant in NP cells and functionally compensated by GLUT3.
Accordingly, a major goal of the investigation is to delineate the mechanisms by which HIF-1 governs glucose
availability and fine-tunes lactate/pyruvate metabolism in NP cells. Studies also address the possibility that age-
dependent decline in NP metabolic health can be retarded by elevating HIF-1 activity and glycolysis. In Aim 1
we will test the hypothesis that in the hypoxic microenvironment of the disc, GLUT3, is the primary HIF-1-
dependent glucose importer. We will determine the mechanisms by which HIF-1 controls the transcription of
GLUT3 and will measure glucose flux in GLUT3-deficient NP cells following the fate of [1-2-13C2]-glucose and
[U-13C5]-glutamine. Using Krt19CreERT driver we will generate and characterize NP-specific Glut3 and Glut1/3
double-knockout mice. In a parallel study, we will use human degenerated NP tissues and isolated cells to
determine how disease severity alters the expression of GLUTs and metabolic function. In Aim 2 we will test the
hypothesis that fine-tuning of lactate-pyruvate fate in glycolytic NP cells is regulated by a HIF-1-responsive
molecular circuit comprising lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the mitochondrial pyruvate importer MPC1, and the
lactate exporter MCT4. Using loss-of-function experiments with Seahorse assays we will investigate how
modulating LDH-MPC1 axis alters NP cell metabolism. We will determine if dysregulation of lactate generation
(LDH) or pyruvate import (MPC1) into mitochondria alters glycolytic and TCA cycle flux using 13C-glucose and
13C-glutamine labeling. We will generate and characterize the phenotype of NP-specific LdhaK19CreER and
Mpc1K19CreER knockout mice to ascertain if this perturbation compromises disc health with aging. Finally, we will
use degenerated human NP tissues to determine how disease severity alters LDH and MPC1 expression and
correlate it to metabolic state. In Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that in aged mice enhanced glycolytic flux and
fine-tuned lactate/pyruvate metabolism mitigate disc degeneration. We will examine the age-dependent changes
in disc phenotype by overexpressing the HIF-1dPA allele insensitive to PHD-mediated degradation in the NP of
14-month-old mice (HIF-1dPAK19CreERT). These mice will also be crossed with Glut3f/f mice to assess whether
glycolysis stimulation by increasing glucose influx underscores the beneficial effects of HIF-1dPA. Similarly, we
will stimulate glycolysis in 14- and 18-month-old TRE-Pfkfb3 transgenic mice in a HIF-1-independent fashion.
We will study the influence of elevated HIF-1 activity and glycolytic flux on key metabolic regulators and their
relationship to NP aging."

Project Summary/Narrative
Immunomodulatory therapies now robustly improve atopic dermatitis, based on selective targeting of cytokine
pathways. However, no immune cell-specific molecular biomarkers can currently differentiate disease states at
the level of individual patients or genetic ancestries, to help guide treatment selection. Our long-term objective
is to understand causes and effective treatments for atopic dermatitis in Asian and Hispanic genetic
backgrounds. The objective of this proposal is to identify genetic biases in, and functionally characterize, a set
of abnormally elevated transcripts in atopic dermatitis skin T cells, which we recently discovered in a cohort of
Asian and Hispanic patients. Our central hypothesis is that transcriptional abnormalities in skin-resident T cells
are upstream, causative drivers in atopic dermatitis and once validated, represent candidate biomarkers for
drug response. The rationale underlying this proposal is that prior work suggests that non-European cohorts
develop atopic dermatitis via genetic pathways outside canonical Th2/Tc2 signaling, a model not supported by
our preliminary data. We will validate our abnormal atopic T cell signature in Asian and Hispanic cohorts and
experimentally test our hypothesis that specific genes in this signature can produce a Th2 cell identity. We will
pursue these aims using innovative technical approaches that include both CRISPR/Cas9-based gene
activation in primary T cells and single-cell spatial transcriptomics, bringing new capabilities to the skin
immunology field. Our proposal is significant because it investigates patient-level biomarkers in atopic
dermatitis T cells in diverse genetic backgrounds. The expected outcome of this proposal is a population- and
mechanism-validated set of genetic abnormalities that typify atopic dermatitis in Asian and Hispanic patients.
These data will have a positive impact on clinical treatments because they will guide treatments to reduce the
substantial morbidity and economic impact stemming from atopic dermatitis in non-European patients."

11143314,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal focuses on the design, development, and validation of a novel soft surgical robot to address critical
unmet needs within the world of lung cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in the
United States and worldwide with an estimated 1.8 million deaths a year, more than breast cancer, prostate
cancer, and colon cancer combined. Early diagnosis and therapy are essential to increase the survival rate of
lung cancer. Because approximately 70% of lung nodules reside in the deeper peripheral region of the lung,
adequate sampling of the tissue is challenging. Traditional manual bronchoscopes are limited in their ability to
access small bronchi because of large diameters. Robotic bronchoscopes available on the market are easier
and more intuitive to maneuver. However, they still present distal dexterity limitations and deep exploration is still
performed without visualization by using semi-flexible needles that are pushed manually by the clinician. This
affects biopsy accuracy and precision and ultimately diagnostic yield, causing delays in diagnosis and treatment
and increasing the risk for tumor growth and spread. In this proposal, we will leverage our prior pioneering work
on the design, fabrication, and preliminary validation of a miniaturized soft robotic bronchoscope for early-stage
lung cancer diagnosis and treatment. This air-powered, image-guided robot is the smallest and most flexible
and dexterous robotic bronchoscope, allowing navigation in branches deeper in the lung and visual feedback
throughout the procedure. The system features two separate working channels to facilitate, for the first time,
simultaneous (i.e., within the same bronchoscopy procedure) diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities and hasten
early-stage lung cancer treatment. We will optimize the soft robotic bronchoscope navigation and stabilization
control based on computer vision algorithms. We will merge pre-operative planning and intra-operative data and
evaluate accuracy and precision in registration. We will develop a mechanical stabilization system at the robot
tip, that will anchor to the surrounding anatomy and work in concert with software stabilization. This will enhance
robot lesion tracking abilities during breathing and other involuntary or accidental movements and counteract
tissue reaction forces during biopsy to improve surgical tasks’ accuracy and precision. We will enable robotic
actuation control for needle tool deployment and steering via multi-DOF soft robotic micro actuators at the robot
tip. Sharp bending angles and large strokes will enable access to hard-to-reach lesions without losing visualization.
We will validate the robot in-vitro and ex-vivo and compare metrics with standard bronchoscopy. We anticipate
our technology to have better navigational abilities, more accurate instrument placement, reduced procedure
times, less tissue trauma, better diagnostic yield, shortened learning curve, and an overall enhanced procedural
experience. Our team is uniquely positioned to achieve success of this study, possessing expertise in surgical
robotics, soft robotics, medical devices, and interventional pulmonology, and having a long history of close and
fruitful collaboration."
11141415,"Project Summary: While gene editing technologies have revolutionized the ability to programmably edit DNA
with high efficiency in diverse tissues, there remain several challenges with DNA editing, including permanent
off-targets, concern for permanent correction of certain diseases, and some diseases being better targeted by
other modalities than gene editing. For example, treatment of triplet repeat disorders with gene editing remains
difficult, due to the difficulty of targeting repeat regions in the genome and the need to make large and precise
deletions, without causing off-target genome rearrangements and other undesired effects on the genome. RNA
modifications, however, may offer a better approach with notable features: 1) temporal and reversible
modification of genetic diseases, 2) minimal off-targets which are reversible and less harmful, and 3) more
versatile editing beyond genome editing. For example, with triplet repeat disorders, an RNA writing strategy
could allow for collapse of the repeats to the exact desired number, an approach that would be more
successful than gene editing or RNA knockdown strategies that have failed. To accomplish RNA writing, which
involves all possible base edits (transitions and transversions), small or large insertions, and small or large
replacements (e.g. exon swapping), some approaches have been developed, such as trans-splicing, but with
limited success. Trans-splicing relies on the recruitment of an RNA template to a pre-mRNA without any active
targeting domains and involves competition with the cis target. As a result, programmable trans-splicing has
had low efficiency. We hypothesized that combining trans-splicing with programmable RNA guided CRISPR
systems could help boost the efficiency of the trans-splicing mechanism, enabling any potential type of RNA
edit, insertion, deletion, or replacement to be incorporated into endogenous transcripts. While we and others
have characterized novel programmable RNA targeting CRISPR systems, such as Cas13, and developed tools
from these systems, use of these tools have been limited in cellular systems due to a non-promiscuous
cleavage activity known as collateral activity. While Cas13 has been shown to have specific RNA cleavage
activity in some cell types, other cell types have had significant collateral cleavage of cellular RNAs, leading to
toxicity in cell models. The proposed work will address these needs by combining biochemical characterization,
structural characterization, and enzyme engineering to develop new RNA targeting CRISPR nucleases
without collateral activity, such as the novel CRISPR-Cas7-11 enzyme, for specific RNA writing tools in
conjunction with trans-splicing to enable any possible RNA edit. Beyond optimizing the RNA writing technology
via trans-splicing optimization using RNA and protein engineering, we will showcase RNA writing’s therapeutic
potential by correcting triplet repeat disorders in iPSC-derived human neurons. The developed technologies in
this proposal will accelerate the pace of biomedical research and enable treatment of many genetic disorders,
many of which are not treatable with gene editing, bringing more therapies to patients."

Many advances in prevention and treatment of disease—that were funded by NIH and other agencies— 
take decades to become adopted into clinical practice. The long-term goal of Implementation Science and 
Equity is to develop a multidisciplinary, internationally recognized research COBRE focused on the theme 
of implementation science, equity, and health. Given the novel nature of the COBRE, and the 
multidisciplinary and multi-site nature of implementation research, a well-organized and efficient 
Administrative Core is essential to the overall management of the COBRE. To support this effort, the 
Administrative Core will tap resources in existing programs, centers, and institutional shared resources at 
KUMC to support Project Leads’ research and development. 
The Administrative Core will set the overall scientific direction of the Implementation Science and Equity 
COBRE’s research, coordinate and integrate all of the COBRE’s activities with the goal of establishing an 
infrastructure at KUMC to sustain these activities long-term beyond the scope of the current project. To 
do so, the Core will pursue 5 specific aims. 
Aim 1. Develop infrastructure to advance the field of health equity using the tools of 
implementation science. 
Aim 2. Develop and implement a mentoring and career development system including career 
development plans, strong mentoring, institutional training and resources, and replacement of 
Project Leads who achieve R01 or equivalent funding for their research. 
Aim 3. Convene an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) and External Advisory Committee (EAC) to 
guide and evaluate the Implementation Science and Equity COBRE. 
Aim 4. Administer and evaluate the Research Pilot Project Program. 
Aim 5. Evaluate the success of Implementation Science and Equity in achieving mission-relevant 
outcomes at the Project Lead and institutional level. 
COBRE PI and Co-Director, Richter and Befort, have extensive experience in mentoring junior faculty; 
administering large research trials, centers, and training Cores; working with rural and urban primary care and 
safety net providers; and collaborating with practice-based research networks. The techniques and 
approaches developed by Implementation Science and Equity COBRE faculty have strong potential for 
sustained impact on the field of implementation science, and the health status of underserved Americans, 
by developing methods to accelerate translation of research findings into practice."
11178804,"1 ABSTRACT – PROJECT 2
 2 Brain metastases are highly aggressive, treatment resistant malignancies with debilitating neurological sequelae
 3 and a grave prognosis. Efforts to understand and modulate the metastatic brain tumor microenvironment (TME)
 4 have great therapeutic potential. Studies have suggested that polarization of macrophages (M1 or M2) may be
5 helpful or harmful in cancer progression (1, 2). Microglia, the brain’s myeloid cells, function in immune
 6 surveillance and mediate the tumor-related inflammatory response, including within the context of the metastatic
 7 brain tumor microniche (tumor-associated macrophages and tumor-associated microglia). We hypothesize
 8 brain metastases are supported in part by native microglia (3), and that these interactions can be
 9 manipulated for therapeutic benefit. The role of microglia in brain metastases has been difficult to investigate
10 given the relative inaccessibility of brain metastases samples, inability to isolate human tumor-associated
11 microglia or monitor their interactions within the TME, and lack of models that include or allow manipulation of
12 microglia while still reliably recapitulating the human disease. To overcome these critical hurdles, we employ the
13 following innovative methods: (i) single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) on fresh, human brain metastases
14 and normal surrounding brain (Neuropathology Core)(4, 5); (ii) isolation and dynamic array sequencing of cell
15 free messenger RNA (cfRNA) from human cerebrospinal fluid (6, 7); (iii) generation of human and murine-derived
16 brain metastasis 3D air-liquid interface (ALI) organoids that include tumor-associated microglia/macrophages
17 (Toolkit Core); and (iv) repopulation of microglia with circulation derived microglia-like cells (CDMCs) with
18 greater than 90% efficiency throughout the entire brain. These four innovative methods allow us to investigate
19 the role of tumor-associated microglia in human brain metastases, model immune cell interactions, and
20 manipulate their function in an animal model of metastatic malignancy. Our multidisciplinary team is uniquely
21 positioned to test the following three aims: (1) Test the extent to which tumor-associated microglia create an
22 immunosuppressive TME supporting brain metastasis. In addition to relating microglia function to brain
23 metastasis local recurrence and distant progression, we will cross-reference our findings with cancer cell intrinsic
24 factors (Project 1) and systemic macrophage reactivity (Project 3); (2) Model tumor-associated microglia within
25 the brain metastatic TME using ALI organoids. We will model tumor and tumor-associated microglia/macrophage
26 interactions and determine the impact of immunotherapy on microglia/macrophage activation and phagocytosis,
27 T-cell activation states, and cell death. Our findings will be integrated with expanding knowledge of cell-intrinsic
28 factors (Project 1) and brain-periphery immune interactions (Project 3); (3): Determine how high efficiency
29 microglia replacement with CDMCs inhibits brain metastasis. We will replace microglia with “weaponized”
30 CDMCs to inhibit cancer cell implantation and disease progression.

7T MRI systems are installed worldwide more and more rapidly and are currently being evaluated in
clinics for a number of conditions such as detection of small focal cortical dysplasia, brain tumors and
multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. However, the signal-to-noise and resolution advantage of 7T MRI is
counterbalanced by increased heterogeneity of the static B0 and transmit B1+ fields that degrade
image quality, which in turn slows clinical translation for example for patients with temporal lobe
epilepsy or MS lesions in the lower part of the brain/cerebellum. Parallel transmission (pTx) is a
popular solution to the problem of inhomogeneous B1+ but is costly (~$100k per transmit channel x 8
or 16 channels) and leads to complex specific absorption rate (SAR) management requiring lengthy
electromagnetic simulations that need to be validated. B0 field inhomogeneities close to the sinuses
and ear canals can be greatly reduced using multi-channel (MC) shim arrays that place dozens of
small loops close to the head and can be rapidly be switched on/off, thus allowing dynamic (slice-by-
slice) shimming which outperforms global brain shimming with conventional spherical harmonics shim
coils. Despite the potential of pTx and MC shim arrays, those state-of-the-art technologies are not
being quickly translated to the clinics because of the cost and complexity of combining and operating
them. In fact, most 7T systems currently operate in single channel mode with conventional spherical
harmonics shim coils, and therefore do not address head-on the dual problems of B0 and B1+ field
inhomogeneities, thus likely yielding sub-optimal image quality that may affect the perceived clinical
value of 7T MRI.
 We propose a bioengineering research program leveraging the field control capability of
MC shim arrays to homogenize the flip-angle at 7T, thus yielding an integrated solution for B0
and flip-angle shimming that bypasses the need for pTx. We develop pulse design strategies that
use the degrees-of-freedom of MC shim arrays for flip-angle control while minimizing power
requirements and SAR. This includes general spokes and kT-point pulses where the gradient blips
are replaced by MC shim array blips with more general spatial distributions, as well as optimal control
of RF, gradient and MC shim current waveforms based on a direct optimization of Bloch dynamics.
We use those approaches to design “universal” pulses that can be played quickly without preparation.
We simulate and build an MC shim array integrated with the RF coil (“AC/DC” design) that is
optimized for simultaneous B0 and flip-angle shimming performance, which we evaluate in healthy
subjects and MS patients."

improves the mental health of marginalized populations globally. My academic training included applied
mathematics (BS, ’05), health policy and management (MPH, ’08), community health sciences (PhD, ’14), and
global mental health (postdoctoral fellowships, ’17 and ’20). I have also received training in mixed-methods and
community-based participatory research. Although I have strong analytical skills in evaluating mental health
interventions, I would now like to develop skills to support the implementation of mental health interventions that
are integrated with the treatment of other health conditions—particularly: cancer. This pivot will require an
additional set of knowledge and skills. Accordingly, my goal in this K01 award is to obtain tailored training and
mentorship in four key areas critical in becoming an independent international research scientist with a focus on
global cancer control and prevention. I have assembled an experienced, international, multidisciplinary team of
mentors who are committed to my career development. The mentoring committee will be co-led by two
distinguished scholars in implementation science and health services research: Dr. Donna Shelley (NYU GPH)
and Dr. Minh Van Hoang (Hanoi University of Public Health [HUPH]). My co-mentors include two experts in
global mental health research and practice—Dr. Lawrence H. Yang (NYU GPH) and Dr. Wietse A. Tol (University
of Copenhagen)—and two experts in cancer control and prevention—Dr. Ophira Ginsburg (NYU Perlmutter
Cancer Center) and Dr. Huong Tran (Hanoi Medical University, Viet Nam National Cancer Institute). The career
development activities are designed to leverage the wide range of mentors and activities at NYU and to facilitate
the knowledge exchange between NYU and HUPH throughout my alternating residences between the U.S. and
Viet Nam. My research plan is to adapt and pilot an enhanced stress management intervention for breast cancer
patients in Viet Nam. First, I will conduct qualitative research to assess the acceptability and appropriateness of
implementing the Self-Help Plus (SH+) program, with an additional peer support component, to help breast
cancer patients manage their distress. The findings from this step will help identify the potential modifications
needed. Second, I will convene a working group to select and implement the adaptations, including the additional
Peer support component (P). Finally, I will pilot the adapted, peer-facilitated SH+P intervention to evaluate its
feasibility. Upon successful completion of the training and research activities, I will be prepared to develop an
R01 proposal to test the implementation and effectiveness of the adapted intervention in reducing psychological
distress among breast cancer patients in Viet Nam. Findings can ultimately inform the development of evidence-
based, culturally-adapted psychosocial interventions for cancer patients in many low- and middle-income
countries as well as for different racial/ethnic groups in the U.S."

Despite being a natural physiological process, menstruation is often associated with health and safety
challenges, especially in low-resource settings. In Nepal, 90% of women and girls follow at least one menstrual
restriction. The most extreme is chhaupadi, a social-religious tradition in which women live in isolation during
menstruation, exposing them to harmful health consequences. There is a dearth of evidence regarding effective
approaches to address chhaupadi, which remains widespread. Research: This community-engaged study aims
to rigorously review extant intervention evidence, as well as co-design and pilot a culturally relevant chhaupadi
intervention to ultimately improve women’s health in Nepal. The study aims are as follows: Aim 1 - Conduct a
Realist Synthesis to elucidate the mechanisms of success or failure of chhaupadi interventions to date, including
key-informant interviews (KIIs) (n=35). Aim 2 - Co-design a chhaupadi intervention with women (n=30) in three
districts using participatory, human-centered design activities. The intervention will be refined via community
meetings (n=6) and KIIs (n=25). Aim 3 - Pilot test the intervention in two matched communities (intervention and
control, n=45). Surveys with standardized measures and focus group discussions (n=6) will be conducted to
assess feasibility, acceptability, and changes in health attitudes and behaviors expected to be impacted by the
intervention. Candidate: Dr. Sara Baumann is an Assistant Professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of
Public Health, Department of Behavioral and Community Health Sciences with extensive previous training in
community-engaged research and women’s reproductive health in Nepal. Training: Four training goals will
support Dr. Baumann’s trajectory toward becoming an independent investigator: 1) Acquire skills in Realist
Synthesis to identify underlying causal mechanisms and reasons for intervention success or failure; 2) develop
expertise in intervention development and assessment, as well as implementation science; 3) attain new skills
in clinical trial design applicable to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); and 4) gain essential skills in
leadership, mentorship, grant writing, and study management. Mentors/Environment: Dr. Baumann will be
supported by an exceptional team of international and multidisciplinary experts including a diverse mentorship
team, advisory board, consultants, and collaborating organizations in Nepal. Her mentorship team has expertise
in essential content and methodological areas such as intervention development, evaluation, clinical trials, and
statistical analyses. Her comprehensive career development plan includes substantial mentorship, didactic
training, and experiential learning at the University of Pittsburgh (US) and Tribhuvan University (Nepal). By
successfully completing these rigorous career development and research plans, Dr. Baumann will be fully
prepared to transition into a successful independent global health researcher and interventionist who harnesses
community-engaged approaches to improve women’s reproductive health in LMICs."
11179666,"Overall Project Summary
The long-term goal of the Johns Hopkins Center for Innovative Diagnostics for Infectious Diseases JH-C[ID]2 is
to accelerate infectious disease diagnostic point-of-care (POC) technology innovation and access to impact
global public health. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and other emerging and re-emerging infectious
diseases continue to threaten human health. Syndrome-based empiric algorithmic treatment protocols are widely
used since diagnostic test results are often not available as actionable data during a clinical encounter. Since
the clinical presentations of many infectious diseases overlap, these protocols often miss asymptomatic infection
and/or result in antibiotic overtreatment, which contributes to emerging antimicrobial resistance. There is thus
an unmet need for POC and at home infectious disease diagnostics; timely and actionable diagnostic data will
increase the number of patients who are diagnosed and appropriately treated at POC in both the US and in RLS.
COVID-19 and the Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics Technology (RADx Tech) Program rapidly increased the
number of platforms and tests available and led to a paradigm shift from centralized labs to POC and self-tests.
The JH-C[ID]2 is well-positioned to continue to catalyze the successful development of POC and OTC assays for
STIs, as well as emerging and re-emerging infections. As the oldest, well-established POCTRN Center, we will
apply the lessons learned from the last 3 cycles to: 1) support the rapid development, commercialization, and
implementation of innovative POC and self-tests for STIs and emerging and re-emerging infection; 2) develop
and expand existing POC COVID-19 platforms toward the diagnosis of STIs and other infectious diseases; and
3) implement functioning core components (Administrative, Dissemination, Clinical, and Technology) to work
smoothly and collaboratively to solicit and support technology that fulfills unmet needs. We have an innovative,
cost-conscious approach that matches devices with the appropriate clinical context and use case for impactful
adoption. With resources from the Center, devices move rapidly along the development pipeline with clear
milestones where go/no-go decisions can be made regarding viability and fitness for use case and value-based
adoption. The JH-C[ID]2 has had a strong track record of supporting both STI and COVID-19 POC and self-tests
that have achieved FDA clearance and Emergency Use Authorization; our clinical sites allow for real-world
clinical studies to assess how POCT might perform in various operating environments. Our clinical and diagnostic
development expertise and approach identify key risk factors to success. Using our network, we aim to promote
the development of accessible infectious disease diagnostics through multidisciplinary innovation along the
development pipeline from research to impactful use in different global settings."
11159272,"Project Summary: This K01 NINDS Award will provide Dr. Yohannes Woldeamanuel with intensive, supervised
training to help him become an independent research scientist focusing on headache medicine, more specifically
on managing migraine using health-promoting lifestyle behaviors (e.g. regular exercise). Using this K01 Award,
Dr. Woldeamanuel will get the support necessary to complete the following goals: (a) become skilled in clinical
trials involving behavioral interventions to manage migraine, (b) train in statistical and bioinformatics methods,
(c) to gain proficiency in mass spectrometry, assays, and quantification, (d) develop activities and scholarship
aimed at career development goals to become an independent investigator. To achieve these goals, Dr.
Woldeamanuel has assembled a team of mentors: Drs. Robert Cowan (Primary Mentor), Oxana Palesh (Co-
Mentor), Jamie Zeitzer (Co-Mentor), Michael Snyder (Co-Mentor), Ying Lu (Advisor), Allis Chien (Advisor).
Research: Increasingly, migraine patients prefer non-drug treatment options and often discontinue drug
treatment due to adverse effects, poor compliance, and cost issues. Currently, there is no direct evidence
demonstrating the utility of regular lifestyle behavior (RLB i.e. regular sleep, exercise, mealtime) to manage
chronic migraine. This proposal is the first to conduct a feasibility and pilot testing study of RLB in managing
chronic migraine using the following specific aims. Primary Aim: To determine the feasibility and acceptability of
RLB in chronic migraine patients. Secondary Aim: To examine the preliminary efficacy of RLB in managing
chronic migraine as measured by reduction in monthly migraine days. Mechanistic Exploratory Aim: To examine
candidate biomarkers that predict chronic migraine patients who are RLB-responders. The development, pilot
testing, and validation RLB-based migraine therapy will have a positive impact in the headache field by providing
a framework for development of efficacious lifestyle-based self-management protocols. By demonstrating it to
be equipotent to daily medications, lifestyle medicine can have the added value of obviating medication risks
and unwanted side-effects common among chronic migraine sufferers. The proposed research is innovative
because its successful completion will pilot test a novel method by utilizing RLB as a self-management tool in
managing migraine. In addition, this proposed research will use multi-omics to elucidate underlying biological
mechanisms of RLB therapy. Application of system biology technology will create a paradigm shift from current
headache research concentrating on single molecule. This approach will be the first of its kind in the headache
field in providing proof-of-principle that personalized lifestyle-based protocols can be used to manage migraine.
This research will form the basis for an R01 application of a full-scale clinical trial before the end of the K award."
11168256,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Neurotransmitter release at synaptic terminals is tightly controlled, and its dysregulation has profound
consequences for neural circuit activity and disease. Here, we propose to examine the in vivo impact of N6-
methyladenosine (m6A), the most common internal modification of mRNA, on synaptic biology. Our ongoing
efforts uncover how Drosophila mutants of m6A factors alter normal synaptic function at the neuromuscular
junction (NMJ) and suggest new mechanisms for m6A regulation. We will build on this knowledge to dissect
how m6A controls the ability of neurons to adjust their set point for neurotransmitter release at the synapse.
This proposal will (1) establish critical roles for the epitranscriptome in normal synaptic function, (2) provide
comprehensive genomic data on m6A targets and the regulatory impacts of these modifications, and (3) define
new regulatory mechanisms by which m6A operates and intersects with other neuronal regulatory pathways.
This work will provide conceptual advances to our knowledge of the regulation of neuronal activity under
physiological conditions and in disease."
11139200,"Project Summary
Dental decay and tooth loss are common problems. Bridges and implants are the primary treatment options
but cannot completely restore the tooth biology and function. Although using cells from embryo to rebuild a
functional bioengineered tooth has been demonstrated in animals, little is known in how to use a cell source to
regenerate teeth in humans. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) hold tremendous promise to
regenerate teeth because of their near-unlimited regenerative capacity that can produce almost any tissues in
the body. However, stem cell-based therapy has been hindered by our limited ability to provide an adequate
microenvironment for stem cell renewal and differentiation and lack of understanding on the key signals
required to regulate cell fate and cell-cell interaction during tooth development. The proposed research aims to
develop a well-defined, feeder-free 3D material microenvironment for regulating self-renewal and
differentiation of hiPSCs into odontogenic epithelial stem cells (OESCs) and neural crest cells (NCCs), and to
co-culture OESCs with NCCs for tooth regeneration. The proposed 3D construct is made of a hybrid scaffold
of chitosan and alginate (CA), two natural polymers that have a proxy structure of glycosaminoglycans, a
major component of the native extracellular matrix (ECM). Natural polymer-based materials are clinically
preferable over synthetic polymers or protein-based materials due to their excellent biocompatibility,
biodegradability, and minimal immunogenicity. In addition, unlike synthetic polymers, The CA scaffold can be
readily decomposed in cell-compatible solutions thus posing no harm to grown stem cells facilitating
subsequent use and analysis. The specific aims of the proposed research are to (1) investigate how material
composition and mechanical properties regulate stem cell renewal and if CA scaffolds optimized for stem cell
renewal can support long-term growth of OESCs and NCCs in vitro; (2) differentiate hiPSCs into OESCs and
NCCs, and identify proper reciprocal interactions of epithelial-mesenchymal stem cells for odontogenesis by
co-culturing OESCs with NCCs in CA scaffolds; (3) enable odontogenic differentiation of hiPSCs and tooth
tissue formation in an orthotopic mouse model. Successful completion of the proposed research would make a
profound impact on stem-cell biology and technology and on human tooth tissue regeneration. Studies of tooth
formation from human pluripotent stem cells will enhance the research community’s understanding on the fate
decisions of tooth-specific lineages in odontogenesis and the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions required
during tooth development."
11161321,"Alcohol abuse disorders (AUD) are a major health hazard that affects millions of people every year in the
United States. Risk factors for AUD include initial resistance to the intoxicating effects of alcohol, as well as
the development of tolerance upon repeat exposure. AUDs also have significant genetic etiology, and many
genes have been implicated from human genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including by our studies.
A detailed molecular understanding of many of these genes is still lacking, though. “Regulation of the actin
cytoskeleton” has been implicated by numerous mammalian alcohol transcriptomics studies, and major
regulators of actin dynamics include the Rho family of GTPases, and their regulators. Our findings, supported
by prior funding periods of this competitive renewal grant, have shown that SNPs in the Rho GTPase regulator
RSU1 are associated with alcohol dependence and drinking, underscoring the translational significance of our
studies. Our overall goal is to better understand the molecular mechanisms and neural tissue-specificity of
Rho GTPase regulators using the powerful genetic toolkit of Drosophila. Based on our prior findings and
extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that different Rho GTPase regulators have distinct alcohol
response phenotypes, depending on the neural circuits they are manipulated in. We will first determine the
circuits and neurotransmitter systems that require regulators of the Rac1 GTPase from the Rho family for
normal alcohol-induced sedation and tolerance. Second, we will determine the role in alcohol sedation and
tolerance of 11 additional members of Rho GTPase signaling, including 8 orthologs of genes associated with
addiction/alcohol phenotypes in human GWAS studies. These candidates have been suggested by alcohol-
induced changes in accessibility of their DNA regulatory regions, as determined by our ATAC-seq experiments.
The data also highlight four transcription factors, based on the overrepresentation of their binding motifs in
alcohol-induced changes of accessible DNA regulatory elements. In a third aim, we will determine the role of
two of these potential master regulators of alcohol-induced changes in gene regulation and in behavioral
alcohol responses. The use of ATAC-seq to determine DNA regulatory elements in a tissue specific manner
highlights a major innovative approach of our application. Taken together, these Aims are in line with NIAAA
priorities focusing on the “Genetics of Alcohol Sensitivity and Tolerance”PA-18-660, which emphasize specific
areas of research interest including “translational research in model organisms…for in vivo validation of
candidate genes…from studies in humans”, and “studies of candidate genes…for tissue-specific gene
expression, and for contributions to biological pathways”. Many prior publications linked to this grant, together
with extensive preliminary data demonstrate the expertise of the investigator and the feasibility of the study.
Our proven translational approach from Drosophila to humans will therefore have direct impact on the
understanding of the function of human addiction genes."

In the setting of increasing prevalence of obesity and pre-diabetes, there is growing interest in identification of
hyperglycemia in early pregnancy to facilitate treatment and minimize fetal exposure. Although multiple
organizations recommend first trimester diabetes screening among individuals with risk factors, the benefits
and drawbacks of detecting glucose abnormalities short of frank diabetes and optimal screening method in
early gestation remain unclear. The overarching goal of the NIDDK-supported ChartGlucose4Moms:
Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on
Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae study (aka, Glycemic Observation and Metabolic Outcomes in
Mothers and offspring (GO MOMs) study) is to evaluate how early pregnancy glycemia, measured using
continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT), relates to gestational
diabetes (GDM) diagnosis at 24-28 weeks' gestation (maternal primary outcome) and large-for-gestational-age
(newborn primary outcome). A secondary objective is to perform comprehensive, longitudinal assessment of
changes in glucose over the course of pregnancy. Enrollment began in April 2021 and will continue for 3.5
years with a target sample size of 2150 participants (200 of which are being recruited at KPNW). GO MOMs
will yield data that are vital to improving our understanding of hyperglycemia in pregnancy, facilitate improved
approaches for GDM screening in early pregnancy, and inform future clinical trials of early GDM treatment."
11138785,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lynch syndrome (LS) is an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome that substantially elevates lifetime risks for
multiple cancers in both men and women. Identifying people with LS enables more frequent and earlier cancer
surveillance and prevention, which can effectively reduce LS-related cancer morbidity and mortality. However,
most people with LS in the United States are not diagnosed. One cost-effective way to identify individuals with
LS is by conducting genetic testing on blood relatives of patients diagnosed with LS (or “cascade testing”), but
the testing rate is low. Pre-test genetic counseling is a promising means to address many of the barriers to testing
and to increase testing uptake. However, pre-test genetic counseling uptake is low in relatives at risk of LS, and
the barriers and facilitators have not been systematically studied. Although informational resources for LS genetic
counseling exist, they are unlikely to be sufficient for motivating behavior change. Aligned with the National
Cancer Institute’s focus on cancer research to advance scientific knowledge and help all people live longer,
healthier lives, the proposed research will address these critical gaps through three aims: 1) Identify barriers and
facilitators to pre-test genetic counseling among relatives with no personal history of cancer but at risk of LS; 2)
Develop a theory-based behavioral intervention to increase pre-test genetic counseling uptake in this population;
and 3) Evaluate and optimize feasibility of the trial methods and the behavioral intervention to prepare for a fully
powered randomized controlled trial and explore the intervention’s preliminary efficacy. I will apply the Behavior
Change Wheel, a well-established behavior change framework, and use mixed methods (i.e., focus groups,
usability testing, and a randomized controlled pilot trial) to develop a behavioral intervention to increase pre-test
genetic counseling uptake. The proposed research will lead to an R01 proposal to test the efficacy of the
intervention. My study team consists of outstanding mentors who have recognized expertise in the
methodologies and topic areas of the proposed research, and a genetic counselor who will ensure that the
research is clinically grounded. In coordination with my research activities, my career development plan includes
structured training and one-on-one mentoring in behavioral medicine and intervention design and development,
design and conduct of clinical trials, qualitative methods, and grant writing and management. Along with the
abundant research and training resources and the supportive environment for transitioning early-career
researchers to independence at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and Department of
Medical Social Sciences, this K99/R00 will enable me to become an independent investigator working to facilitate
decision making in patients and other stakeholders who face difficult cancer-related decisions, including those
involving genetic risks."
11138857,"PROGRAM SUMMARY
The objective of our LAUNCH program is to continue our global health research training program called the
Global Health Equity Scholars (GHES) designed to create a new community of researchers, educators, and
professionals who are prepared to address new and emerging global health challenges. We will build on the last
nine years of this training program to create a cadre of new researchers who will dedicate their research careers
to address the health problems that arise out of the inequity of human conditions prevalent in informal human
settlements (slums). Rather than addressing one disease at a time, we propose to provide a comprehensive,
multidisciplinary, and integrated approach to deal with urban and rural informal human settlement health issues,
developed over many years by the participating faculty members of this program. This program will comprise
four US partner institutions (Consortium) - Yale University, Stanford University, University of Arizona, and
University of California at Berkeley, each led by a leader in global health research with more than 10 years of
collaboration among themselves. Together, core faculty mentors from these institutions conduct research at 25
institutions in 21 countries, representing regions of Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Asia, the
Pacific, and Eastern Europe. The GHES program will address a wide range of health research topics including
HIV/AIDs, emerging and high-consequence infectiousdiseases, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), women's
health, environmental health, mental health, interpersonal violence, substance abuse, injuries, and the
interaction of all of these health issues within the framework of slum health. Training will target US postdoctoral
fellows and pre-doctoral students and low and middle-income country (LMIC) postdoctoral fellows. We plan to
recruit 9-10 trainees/year with 60% of them as US postdoctoral fellows. The trainees will spend 10-12-months at
an LMIC site under the supervision of the Consortium and their collaborating LMIC mentors. Didactic workshops
on global health research methods will be conducted both in-person and online. LMIC trainees will spend 2-3
months at US institutionsto undergo training in methods not provided at their institutions. All of the trainees will
be provided with research and career mentorship throughout their training and tracked for career development
after completion of their GHES-supported research work. Thus, under this program, we expect the trainees to
be exposed to one important theme in global health research - health equity - through research that deals with
health concerns of vulnerable populations residing in informal human settlements and provide them with an
opportunity to become experts in this new global health discipline. The overall impact of this training program is,
therefore, to create a new cadre of global health researchers and leaders who address the emerging health
issues arising out of ever-expanding informal human settlements of LMICs."

11167895,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 25% of diabetic patients experience diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs). This is a significant clinical
problem since there are no effective biomarkers for predicting outcomes, no drug candidates that have recently
been FDA-approved and no therapies that are widely effective in treatment. Additionally, the prevalence of
diabetes and non-healing DFUs are highest among minorities, such as in Native American and Hispanic
populations, and associated with social deprivation and high mortality.
The University of Arizona (UArizona) is the leading public research university in the American Southwest and an
ideal transdisciplinary research community for studying DFU healing. The partnership between UArizona and
Banner Health provided service to 5,680 patients with open wounds last year. Ranging from trauma to podiatry,
Banner Health saw 3,770 individuals with diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) in the past 3 years. Dr. Geoffrey Gurtner
has an established history in studying both late-stage biomarker validation through clinical trials and also
mechanistic and early-stage biomarkers identification through the collection of many high-quality biosamples
and longitudinal data (Aim 1). This is supported by both the large patient population at UArizona as well as Dr.
Gurtner’s history in identifying rate cell subpopulations in DFU samples collected from human patients.
Next, we aim to create a unified Standard of Care through the execution of high-quality clinical trials for DFUs,
which historically have been difficult to recruit, and also by collecting high-quality data to address the
heterogeneity of DFUs with complex pathologies, co-morbidities, and social factors. At UArizona, Dr. Gurtner
and Dr. Zhou conduct high-quality clinical trials and have access to a wide distribution of patients and a range of
techniques to make sure that “No DFU Patient Goes Unstudied” (Aim 2). Next, our diverse patient pool will allow
us to specifically understand how social and environmental contextual factors (“social determinants of health”;
SDH) may affect diabetic healing and biomarkers, specifically be recruiting over a diverse and expansive patient
pool (Aim 3). Finally, we have access to not just the entire Banner Health Network (BHN), but also to the Indian
Health Network and outreach programs for Latino communities. Through this expansive network that
incorporates people of all demographics and socio-economic statuses, we will establish effective collaborations
between the CRU and new clinical sites to generate cooperative problem-solving and high-level training, with
shared resources and values (Aim 4)."

11177264,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer is a diverse group of malignancies that can vary greatly in molecular biology, etiology, and
presentation of symptoms. While it accounts for 2.5% of all cancers among women, it results in roughly 5%
of cancer-related deaths due to its high fatality rate. This is because 75% of patients are diagnosed with
advanced disease, largely attributed to its relatively late presentation of symptoms and a lack of reliable
detection and monitoring strategies. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by all cells, including ovarian
cancer, and their cargo reflects their cells of origin. They have shown immense potential as stable
biomarkers, however their low abundance compared to EVs from healthy cells and a lack of sufficiently
sensitive characterization tools has limited their clinical translation. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy
(SERS) is sensitive enough to biochemically fingerprint even single EVs, and the information-rich spectra
produced in EV SERS can be fed into machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify them based on their
latent spectral features. Despite early progress in EV SERS, the highly heterogeneous nature of EVs
indicates that their separation into distinct subpopulations prior to SERS analysis may help improve disease
diagnosis, classification, and monitoring. Microfluidic devices are uniquely capable of separating EV s into
subpopulations of interest while simultaneously enabling SERS spectral acquisition in a single device. In the
proposed research, during the mentored phase, ML-enabled inverse design will be combined with high
resolution nanofabrication techniques to improve the signal strength and spectral quality attainable from EV
SERS. Preliminary data indicates that the SERS enhancement is highly dependent on the substrate’s
nanoscale geometry, which is particularly important for EVs compared to conventional chemical analysis.
Towards the end of the mentored phase, once the improved substrates have been thoroughly tested using
bioreactor-produced EVs, they will be incorporated into two distinct microfluidic devices and tested
throughout the independent phase using both cell culture and patient EV samples. One device will capture
different subpopulations of EVs directly onto the microfluidic SERS substrates based on specific surface-
antigens for multiplexed characterization, while the other will separate EVs precisely by size and flow them
over the microfluidic SERS substrates to produce EV SERS barcodes. In parallel, ML algorithms tailored
specifically to these platforms will also be developed to process and classify the acquired spectra. This
proposal is multidisciplinary, utilizing advanced ML and micro-nanofabrication techniques as well as EV
production, isolation, and characterization strategies. These experiments are innovative and significant
because they will develop ML inverse design architectures specifically for EVs as well as microfluidic EV
SERS for characterizing and classifying ovarian cancer."

The Mount Sinai U54 continues to accrue new lung cancer (LC) patients to its large, highly annotated
longitudinal cohort with routine specimen collection. Updated research focus areas include: 1) the ability
of patients with lung cancer to maintain robust immune responses to infections and/or vaccinations related
to novel variants; 2) the long-term health consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with lung
cancer; and 3) biologic factors that influence SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility using in vitro modeling. The
magnitude, quality, breadth and durability of the systemic and mucosal immune responses elicited by
influenza virus and RSV vaccinations will be determined in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 in LC patients.
Key areas to be addressed here include the effects of: vaccine platform, timing of vaccination, concordance
or discordance of patient immune response to differing vaccines, a more detailed understanding of the
effects of cancer treatment, and the correlation between cellular and antibody response. The Mount Sinai
finding that vaccination for influenza was associated with a subsequent induction of SARS-CoV-2 anti-
spike Abs in our patients will be validated using patient specimens from collaborators within the Pooling
Project. The Mount Sinai clinical team will continue to Investigate socioeconomic and demographic
associations with the risk of compromised immune responses and/or severe infection. Additionally, residual
plasma from select patients will be used to determine whether patients who experienced a SARS-CoV-2

11083179,"Large-scale complex networks support brain function across the lifespan, and features of brain networks 
are hypothesized to confer both vulnerability and resilience to the brain changes that accompany healthy 
and pathological aging. Brain network organization can be characterized during resting wakefulness using 
functional magnetic resonance imaging and system segregation is a measure of this organization which 
quantifies the degree to which an individual’s brain network contains functionally distinct brain systems. In 
healthy adult humans, increasing age is associated with decreasing system segregation; declining system 
segregation is associated with worsening memory ability, alterations in brain activity, and is prognostic of 
Alzheimer’s Disease dementia beyond brain atrophy and pathology. The precise mechanism of
aging-accompanied brain network changes is presently unclear and gaining a deeper understanding of 
them would be greatly advanced by the development of non-human models of brain network aging. A 
precision imaging-based approach will be used to develop and characterize a comprehensive longitudinal 
description of functional brain network changes across the mouse lifespan. Awake resting-state fMRI will 
be measured in individual mice as they grow older (from 3 to 21 months) and will be used to quantify 
changes in brain network organization (particularly segregation). Brain network changes will be related to 
behavior and cognition (including measures of memory, learning, and sensory-motor function), both as a 
function of age and sex. Targeted lesions to vulnerable brain network locations (network hubs) will be 
administered at younger and older ages, to test the causal contributions of hub nodes towards maintaining 
brain network integrity, and evaluate the susceptibility of older-age brain networks to focal damage. This 
work will broaden understanding of complex network function, large-scale network mechanisms
underlying aging-related behavioral alterations, and the impacts of brain network disruption occurring at 
different life stages. The characterization of large-scale brain network organization with respect to
aging-related decline in the intact brain, together with the use of targeted lesions, will set the stage to

11142019,"Project Summary/Abstract 
Fluorine is an essential constituent of many commercial molecules, including (radio)pharmaceuticals, 
agrochemicals, and functional materials. Fluorine-19 ( stable isotope) is routinely introduced into 
pharmaceuticals to modulate pharmacological properties. Many positron emission tomography (PET) 
imaging agents are labeled with fluorine-18 (radioactive isotope) for studying and monitoring disease, 
evaluating drug-target engagements, and enriching clinical trials of therapeutics. Critically, PET is continually 
used to improve disease detection, treatment, and prevention, which is fundamentally consistent with the 
mission of NIBIB. Despite progress in developing fluorine-18 imaging agents for these applications, more 
robust, efficient, and reproducible radiosyntheses are required to support and expedite tracer discovery and 
meet the urgent demand for radiopharmaceuticals from the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries. 
Therefore, the primary focus of this proposal is to overcome challenges associated with radiofluorination by 
inventing radiolabeling methods that support the design of PET imaging agents. Specifically, the central claim 
is that fluorine-18 labeled organic molecules can be rapidly accessed by designing zinc-mediated and metal-free amide C-H radiofluorination radiolabeling reactions. Zinc is an abundant, inexpensive, and non-toxic 
element that facilitates a-amido C-H radiofluorination reactions, albeit inefficiently, with a limited scope. Over 
the K99 phase, the candidate collected rigorous preliminary data demonstrating that amide C-H 
radiofluorination reactions are possible, and this award will study, refine, optimize, and showcase this protocol 
for PET biomedical imaging applications. Specifically, the ROO proposal is divided into three aims: Aim 1 is 
to develop a fully optimized amide C-H radiofluorination protocol that delivers stereochemically enriched 
fluorine-18 labeled amides containing a broad range of valuable fluoroalkyl functional groups. Aim 2 is to 
demonstrate the feasibility of new amide C-H radiofluorination reactions with bioactive PET imaging scaffolds 
on a commercial radiosynthesis module for clinical production Aim 3 is to prepare and assess the stability of 
multiple representative therapeutics containing fluorine-18 labeled amides. Ultimately, the enhancement of 
PET imaging technology, as described in this proposal, is expected to fundamentally alter the current 
(radio)synthetic fluorination paradigm and expedite radiofluorination, providing unrealized and rapid access 
to fluorine-18 labeled pharmaceuticals that support the improvement of patient outcomes and a reduction in 
healthcare costs for the American people in the long term. Broadly, this project will provide new opportunities 
to merge radiochemistry and organic/organometallic chemistry, supporting the development of a world-leading radiosynthetic methods program at the University of Pennsylvania."

Many pathologic or disease conditions can now be ascribed to disrupted osteocyte functions. However, a limited
number of osteocyte-enriched genes have been studied in bone disease. Our previous work focused on the
transcription factor SP7 and its role in regulating osteocyte dendrite formation. One major goal of this proposal
is to further elucidate the osteocytic function of SP7 and decode how SP7 regulates osteocytogenesis. To
address this fundamental question, I have developed a comprehensive approach based on in vivo and in vitro
methods to define the effect of an osteogenesis imperfecta-causing SP7 R316C mutation in osteocytes. Results
from these approaches, in combination with single-cell transcriptomics and complementary bioinformatic
analysis, will illuminate the nature of the human R316C mutation in osteocyte development; this includes
determining whether this mutation selectively affects the osteocytic function of SP7, identifying direct target
genes that are selectively affected by this mutation, and how R316C influences osteocytogenesis by capturing
the osteocyte subpopulations that are blocked by this mutation from maturation. To perform transcriptomic
profiling of developing osteocytes, I will develop novel laser-assisted microdissection methods to isolate viable
matrix embedded cells for single cell RNA-sequencing. Like neurons in the brain, osteocytes in bone
communicate with one another through an extensive network of dendritic connections. I will perform bioinformatic
analyses to identify genes with restricted expression in neurons and osteocytes, and the functional skeletal roles
of candidate shared genes will be tested in vitro and in vivo. Overall, the aims described in this proposal have
strong potential to define the role of osteocyte-specific genes (e.g., SP7) in bone, as well as uncover the
contribution of osteocyte-specific genes in human skeletal disease. Moreover, this work may lead to identification
of new pathways that can be targeted by therapeutics to ensure the osteoblast-to-osteocyte transition.
My long-term career goal is to obtain a tenure-track faculty position and successfully establish a lab that is at the
forefront of bridging the gap between osteocyte development and bone health. I expect the K99 phase of this
proposal, which includes completing the characterization of R316C mutation in mice and the identification of
direct targets and novel pathways affected by the R316C mutation, to take 1-2 years and result in at least one
high quality publication. The training and mentorship provided during the K99 phase will prepare me with strong
background and starting point for my continuing studies and grant applications as an independent investigator.
The following R00 phase of the award will then permit me to further explore the regulation of SP7 during
osteocytogenesis, as well as to examine the skeletal impact of neuron-osteocyte shared genes in vivo. Together,
these data will be used to justify future studies proposed in an R01 grant application that I expect to submit at
the beginning of the third year of the independent phase."

a-Thalassemia (a-thal) is caused by insufficient production of the a-globin protein due to either deletional or non-
deletional mutations of endogenous a-globin genes. In patients with severe a-thal (no or minimal synthesis of a-

transplantation, but this approach is limited to only some patients and is plagued by potential serious adverse
effects, such as graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease. No mouse models of severe a-thal are available to
study this disease and to test new therapies. Our proposed work will address these knowledge gaps by
developing, characterizing, and validating mouse models and gene therapy vectors for treating severe a-thal.
We hypothesize that new mouse models of a-thal will define the basic mechanism that governs RBC synthesis
in the presence of excess ß-globin chains and how it affects erythropoiesis, iron metabolism and coagulation. In
our first aim we will characterize these features in novel mouse models of severe a-thalassemia. As preliminary
studies, we generated adult animals that do not produce a-globin chains (AG-KO) through transplantation of both
AG-KO fetal liver and conditional AG-cKO hematopoietic stem cells into wild-type recipient mice. These animals
demonstrate a worsening phenotype, with red blood cells (RBC) that express only b-globin chains. Due to severe
limitation of these RBC to deliver oxygen, the mice eventually succumb to a condition resembling hypoxemia,
showing splenomegaly, liver and kidney iron deposition, and vaso-occlusive events. We are now generating
animals that only express one copy of the a-globin gene to characterize this disease in the context of minimal
synthesis of a-globin chains. Most of the patients affected by a-thal carry large deletions of the a-globin genes.
These deletions represent a serious challenge for gene therapy approaches based on genome editing.
Therefore, we hypothesize that severe a-thal can be safely rescued by gene addition. In our second aim we will
fully validate lentiviral vectors carrying the a-globin gene for their safety and ability to reverse the most severe
forms of a-thal. We identified ALS20aI, in which a-globin is under control of the ß-globin promoter and its locus
control region, as the most efficient vector. One copy of ALS20αI yields exogenous a-globin at a level
comparable to that produced by one endogenous a-globin gene. Indeed, ALS20aI rescues animals generated
with AG-KO fetal liver or conditional AG-cKO hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting that a relatively low vector
copy number could result in dramatic therapeutic benefits. We will test ALS20aI or its derivatives for their ability
to express the safest and highest level of a-globin in mouse hematopoietic stem cells and human-derived
erythroid cell lines that synthesize low or no a-globin chains. We will then evaluate the constructs for their ability
to rescue the abnormal features observed in a-thal patient cells. Thus, the goals of this study are to develop
novel adult mouse models of a-thal and an effective gene therapy approach for this disease."

Venezuelan equine encephalitic virus (VEEV) infects humans and is classified as a Category B pathogen by
NIAID due to its easy dissemination. In humans, VEEV infection can result in inflammation, acute degenerative
neuronal changes, behavioral changes, memory loss and seizures, with severe cases resulting in death. There
is currently no antiviral therapeutic treatment for patients infected with VEEV. The live attenuated vaccine TC83
can protect against VEEV infection, but due to a high frequency of adverse side effects, its use is limited to
military and at-risk laboratory personnel. Therefore, the discovery of new therapeutics is urgently needed. VEEV
is able to suppress host transcription by blocking cellular nuclear trafficking at least partially due to its capsid
protein forming a complex with the host proteins importinα/β (Impα/β1) and CRM1. Mutation of the nuclear
localization sequence (NLS) of capsid results in loss of viral virulence, indicating that the ability of capsid to enter
the nucleus is critical for VEEV pathogenesis and a viable target for antiviral therapeutic development. We
hypothesize that small molecule inhibitors that interfere with capsid-Impα protein-protein interaction (PPI) will
prevent VEEV induced pathologies. We have identified two novel small molecules, 1111684 and G281-1485,
which disrupt the ability of VEEV capsid to interact with Impα, leading to altered capsid localization, decreased
viral replication and increased survival of the host cell. Here we propose to design and synthesize second-
generation capsid-Impα PPI inhibitors with improved potency and bioavailability. To this end, we proposed 4
interlinked aims: Aim 1: In silico design of second-generation capsid-Impα inhibitors; Aim 2: Synthesis and
biochemical characterization of second generation capsid-Impα inhibitors; Aim 3: Determine the in vitro
selectivity index and bioavailability of capsid:Impα inhibitors; and Aim 4: Determine the PK/PD/Tox of
capsid:Impα inhibitors. The new knowledge gained from our study will be applicable to wide-range applications
involving capsid-Impα interactions including HSV-1 or eastern and western equine encephalitic viruses."

provided research training to 221 Fogarty Global Health Fellows and Scholars, who to date have generated
866 publications. With this competitive renewal, we propose to expand training activities aimed at increasing
the likelihood of trainees becoming independent global health scientists and leaders. We have modified our
consortium name to reflect this new emphasis: Northern Pacific Global Health Leadership, Education, And
Development for Early-career Researchers (NPGH LEADERs). We propose to continue partnerships based in
nine countries: Kenya, Uganda, Ghana, Cameroon, Liberia, Peru, Thailand, Nepal, and India. To achieve our
objective of developing the next generation of independent global health scientists and leaders, we will offer
12-month research and leadership training with the following specific aims: Aim 1: To ensure excellence in
scientific inquiry, trainees will complete a comprehensive curriculum in global health research, including how to
frame novel, relevant, and feasible scientific questions, prepare detailed scientific protocols, and plan for the
implementation of a mentored research project in a low- or middle-income country. Aim 2: To address the
challenges of research implementation in a low-resource setting, trainees will follow an explicit, expedited,
supported, and mentored progression from research planning to pragmatic implementation and process
management. Aim 3: To prepare trainees for careers as independent scientists and to excel in both leadership
and management, we will support trainees in development of individualized “road maps” to define the research,
management and leadership skills necessary for their transition into independent investigators. We will also
expand alumni support for alumni to further strengthen the scientific and leadership skills necessary for
transitioning to the next generation of independent global health scientists. The four U.S. universities, as well
as Indiana University - an associated partner since 2016 - have committed cost-sharing funds totaling
$565,000 to increase recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities and a second year of fellowship
for the most productive fellows. We anticipate supporting at least 10 trainees each year, for a total of 50
trainees over the five year grant period; 60% of trainees will be at the U.S. postdoctoral level and 40% will
implement HIV-related research projects."
11175768,"Survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) manifest pulmonary and neurological sequelae, as
clearly documented during the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal of this project is to ameliorate both pulmonary and
brain neuronal injury in ARDS and mitigate against long-term complications. Using a mouse model of hyperoxic
lung injury, we recently discovered that hyperoxia leads to a surprisingly profound depletion of pulmonary B cells,
with regulatory and memory B cell subsets being particularly vulnerable. B cell depletion has also been reported
in patients with ARDS. We aim to modulate inflammatory responses in ARDS by administering B cells that would
ameliorate this deficit and restore immune regulation. We now show that systemic administration of naïve B cells
has significant anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective effects in hyperoxic lung injury and that a fraction of these
B cells traffic to the lungs. Our central hypothesis is that adoptively transferred naïve B cells provide multiorgan
protection in hyperoxia-associated ARDS; we propose that this is achieved by trafficking to the sites of tissue
injury to restore immune regulation and suppress inflammatory responses in IL-10 and/or adenosine-dependent
manner. In Aim 1, we will study the efficiency of B cell homing to the lungs and brain and characterize the
phenotype(s) of B cells that home in these inflamed sites. In Aim 2, we will identify the immunomodulatory effects
of adoptively transferred B cells in the lungs and brain and study their dependence on B cell-derived non-Ig
factors including IL-10 and adenosine. In Aim 3, we will determine the effects of syngeneic and allogeneic B cell
therapy on long-term pulmonary and neurologic outcomes. Understanding long-term outcomes after allogeneic
B cell therapy will be critical for future translation of this therapy into clinical practice. The results of these
proposed experimental studies will direct our further research into B cell therapy for ARDS. Our studies may
have substantive translational impacts, in identifying novel therapeutic targets for treating patients with this highly
significant and increasingly common clinical problem."
11175769,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia that is associated with
disseminated intravascular coagulation and fatal bleeding. Although chemotherapy and differentiation therapies
are quite effective, APL is still associated with a high incidence of early death (4-26%) that typically occurs within
30 days of diagnosis. Notably, severe bleeding, particularly intracranial bleeding, is the leading cause of the early
deaths in APL. The precise mechanisms of APL-induced bleeding are unknown. However, observational studies
indicate that it is characterized by thrombocytopenia, hyperfibrinolysis and coagulation activation. The goal of
the proposal is to determine the mechanisms of bleeding in APL. We have recently established two new mouse
models of APL (xenograft and allograft models) that reproduce many of the hemostatic abnormalities of APL
patients. Podoplanin (PDPN) activates platelets via C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) on platelets. Blast
cells from APL patients express high levels of PDPN suggesting a role of PDPN in thrombocytopenia.
Consistently, we observed high plasma PDPN levels in our allograft model. Increased levels of plasmin-
antiplasmin complexes (PAP) and D-dimer are observed in APL patients. We observed high levels of PAP and
D-dimer in our mouse models of APL. The S100A10 (S100)/annexin A2 (AA2) and the urokinase-type
plasminogen activator (uPA)/ uPA receptor (uPAR) complexes are expressed on APL cells and may play a role
in hyperfibrinolysis. APL patients have high levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAT). We observed high
levels of TAT in our mouse models of APL. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), which includes blast
cells, from APL patients have high levels of tissue factor (TF) activity. Importantly, we recently found that
inhibition of APL cell-derived TF reduced TAT levels in the xenograft model. Similarly, inhibition of both APL cell-
derived and host cell-derived TF reduced TAT levels in the allograft model. To date, no studies have evaluated
the roles of the PDPN-CLEC-2 pathway, the S100/AA2/tPA and uPA/uPAR pathways in the coagulopathy and
bleeding in APL using mouse models. In addition, our study is the only study that shows the role of TF in the
activation of coagulation in mouse models of APL. Our central hypothesis is that bleeding in APL patients is
driven by simultaneous reduction of platelets and activation of fibrinolysis, and coagulation which collectively
impose a catastrophic failure of the hemostatic system. We will test this hypothesis by determining the individual
contributions of the PDPN-CLEC-2 pathway, the S100/AA2/tPA and the uPA/uPAR pathways, and TF to the
coagulopathy and bleeding in mouse models of APL. Our study will provide a better understanding of
mechanisms of APL-associated coagulopathy and bleeding. We will also have explored new treatments for APL-
associated bleeding and APL itself. In addition, our study may find new biomarkers to identify APL patients at
high risk of bleeding using omics techniques."
11175771,"SUMMARY
Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and the inability of the RV contractility to keep up with increased afterload, or
ventricular-arterial (V-A) uncoupling, in pulmonary hypertension (PH) are strongly related to poor outcomes in
PH. Several preclinical studies, including ours, demonstrate multi-fold increases in RV free wall (RVFW)
contractile forces that occur as a crucial adaptive mechanism. Yet, as RV continues to remodel the relative
increase in contractility is less compared to the increase in afterload causing V-A uncoupling. RV wall contractility
depends on the ability of the muscle to generate active forces to deform the free wall and an optimal myo-
architecture helicity to translate the generated force to the desired RV ejection. However, increased wall stiffness
or changes in helicity requires generation of more contractile forces which may become limited, hampering RV’s
adaptation and function. Indeed, several studies have demonstrated that patients with PH have increased RV
stiffness which independently predicts worse outcomes. However, how changes in RVFW architecture, stiffness
and contractility progress and relate to RV’s transition to maladaptation remain unknown. In addition, as RV
remodeling is primarily triggered by increases in RV afterload, the role of resistive vs. pulsatile components of
afterload in RV maladaptation remains unclear. Understanding the biomechanical basis of the transition from
adaptive to maladaptive RV to identify at-risk patients remains an unmet need in PH. We hypothesize that
passive remodeling in the RVFW competes against contractile adaptation, and coalescing passive (stiffness)
and active (contractility) remodeling of the RV into stiffness-to-contractility ratio (SCR), which depends on distinct
contributions of resistive and pulsatile afterload, enables early identification of RV’s transition to V-A uncoupling
before RV’s dysfunction is evident in global markers. We will test this hypothesis via the following aims:
1. Determine mechanisms underlying elevations in SCR and resulting V-A uncoupling. We will separate the
independent contribution of passive and active tissue-level biomechanical characteristics to organ-level function.
2. Develop and validate tools to non-invasively estimate SCR in predicting V-A uncoupling. We will develop and
use an integrated echocardiography-deep learning tool to non-invasively assess the independent role of early
increases in SCR in predicting V-A uncoupling. 3. Identify the contributions of PVR and PAC in increasing SCR.
We will separate the contributions of increases in distal resistance versus reductions in PA compliance to RV
afterload and increases in SCR. 4. Determine the role of RV passive and active remodeling events and SCR in
functional outcomes and clinical events in patients. We will determine relationships between SCR, V-A coupling,
and clinical events in retrospective human patients. Our studies will establish a novel RVFW-level prognostic
marker, delineate its biomechanical basis, and develop non-invasive tools to estimate it. Our results will assist
with identifying PH patients at risk early in the disease to study therapeutic strategies to maintain and improve
RV function in PH."

The CANOE Partnership: Cancer Awareness, Navigation, Outreach, and Equitable Indigenous Health
Outcomes U19 Cooperative Agreement is proposed in response to the need to improve cancer outcomes for
American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities nationally, with an emphasis on the Washington State
(WA) catchment area of the Fred Hutch/University of Washington/Seattle Children’s Cancer Consortium, a
National Cancer Institute (NCI) designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. The proposed work builds on the
Consortium’s substantial community engagement with Tribes and Tribal Organizations over the past 22 years,

“
Digital smoking cessation intervention for nationally-recruited American Indians and
Alaska Natives: A full-scale
randomized controlled trial
” (R01CA284687; PI: Bricker) Disparities in cancer outcomes for the AI/AN population
are due to multiple social determinants. Three major sources of these disparities, amenable to intervention, are:
1) behaviors to reduce cancer risk (e.g., smoking cessation), 2) access to appropriate screening by way of
imaging technologies (e.g., appropriate application of chest computed tomography and mammography) and
colorectal cancer (CRC) screening procedures such as fecal immunochemical test (FIT), and colonoscopy; and
3) primary prevention. We propose a multidimensional approach to addressing these sources of disparate cancer
outcomes in partnership with our Tribal and community collaborators at the South Puget Intertribal Planning
Agency (representing the Chehalis, Nisqually, Skokomish, Shoalwater Bay, and Squaxin Island Tribes) and the
Black Hills Center for American Indian Health (Rapid City, SD). Together, we will use community based
participatory research (CBPR) approaches and the Indigenous Cancer Health Equity Initiative Model to
empower and engage Tribes and Tribal organizations through our three research projects. Our Overall Specific
Aims are: 1) Improve rates of cessation of commercial tobacco smoking among a nationally recruited sample of
AI/AN adults (Research Project 1); 2) Improve rates of lung, colorectal, and breast cancer screenings among our
Tribal partner populations in the Consortium’s catchment area (Research Projects 2 & 3); 3)Prepare the next
generation of researchers in Indigenous cancer equity and provide them with resources to obtain preliminary
data to inform future cancer equity research in Indian Country (Pilot Grant Program); and 4) Develop
infrastructure to support equitable engagement of Tribal partners and Indigenous Frameworks in cancer
research. (Administrative and Community Engagement Cores). The overall public health impact of the proposed
work will be high, given the focus on smoking cessation, cancer screenings and vaccinations that altogether will
prevent and control cancers that are highly prevalent and are responsible for a large share of disparate mortality
rates among Indigenous populations. The public health impact of this work will be high, given its focus on
modifiable behaviors and on future generations of Indigenous Cancer Health Equity researchers."

Sex differences are commonly reported in Lewy body dementia, although the reasons are unknown.
Phenotypic differences can be described by differences in the pathology and can be associated with
differences in genetic risk loci. We hypothesize that Alzheimer's disease-related genetic risk factors will be
associated with higher dementia risk in women with Lewy body dementia, given the higher likelihood of
Alzheimer's co-pathology in women. However, even for women with pure Lewy body pathology,
Alzheimer's phenotype is more common than Lewy body dementia phenotype, indicating sex differences
for clinicopathologic correlations. This may be due to differences in regional pathology burden for men and
women. Specific regional Lewy body and Alzheimer's pathology burden have been associated with different
symptoms; and we hypothesize that men will have more neocortical Lewy body burden and women will
have more pathology burden in the medial temporal lobe given the more common Alzheimer's phenotype in
women. As Alzheimer's disease is the most common misdiagnosis for patients with Lewy body dementia,
we will also develop sex-specific models with clinical and genetic variables to clinically differentiate Lewy
body and Alzheimer's pathology. These findings will improve our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of
Lewy body dementia, assist with patient selection for future clinical trials in both Lewy body dementia and
Alzheimer's disease, and provide targets for precision medicine in these neurodegenerative dementias.

 Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are highly comorbid,
presenting a clinical challenge with limited treatment efficacy. Treatments addressing both PTSD and
AUD concurrently are more efficacious than treating each disorder separately due to their overlapping
neurobiological basis involving alterations in incentive salience, stress/negative affect, and executive
control network functioning. Despite this, no treatment has been clearly effective for both disorders.
 Topiramate, an FDA-approved anticonvulsant affecting GABAergic and glutamatergic signaling,
has shown efficacy in treating AUD in several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and has some evidence
of effectiveness in treating PTSD from several open-label and small RCTs. Positive results in one open-
label trial and one small RCT suggest topiramate may benefit both PTSD and AUD symptoms in patients
with both disorders. Preclinical studies also support its efficacy in reducing anxiety-like behavior and
altered stress responses in animal models.
 A recent study indicated that topiramate’s effects on alcohol use were moderated by a
polymorphism of the GRIK1 gene (coding for the kainate receptor GluK1 subunit), with significant
benefits observed only among rs2832407 C-allele homozygotes.
 Project 2 of the proposed center is a double-blind, 2-group RCT evaluating topiramate's effects
versus placebo in patients with comorbid PTSD and moderate-to-severe AUD. This trial will rigorously
test whether topiramate's effects in AUD extend to patients with co-occurring PTSD and whether it
benefits PTSD symptoms in this population. It will also test if the rs2832407 genotype predicts clinical
response to topiramate for AUD and PTSD. This study will contribute to understanding topiramate’s
mechanisms in the comorbid AUD/PTSD population and discover predictors of treatment response.
Supporting overall center aims, this trial will provide data for studies on topiramate’s effects on brain
chemistry and function (Project 3) and relate plasma biomarkers to neuroimaging markers.
 The supplement request aims to secure additional time and funding to complete recruitment and
achieve the study's objectives on topiramate’s therapeutic potential in individuals with co-occurring
PTSD and moderate-to-severe AUD. With the extension until August 31, 2025, and additional funds, we
aim to reach our goal of 150 subjects. This, combined with $200,000 in institutional matching funds, will
ensure the study's successful completion, providing significant insights into integrated therapeutic
approaches for these complex disorders."
11143326,"Project Summary
Despite extensive research on the relationship between early-life social and physical environmental exposures,
and consequent effects on aging, little is understood about the mechanisms that link social interactions and
aging. The work proposed here provides technological, conceptual, and analytical innovations to fill this gap.
The R61 phase of our proposal will build on our existing technologies, which precisely measure how groups of
the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, interact with each other as well as with their surroundings, to
accommodate long-term, longitudinal studies of aging individuals. Key components of our system will
include: (i) our DTrack video tracking system, which provides detailed and near-continuous quantification of
changes in movement, exploration, and social interactions, and (ii) our FLIC system, which measures each fly’s
interactions with food every 50ms and allows us to analyze the fine structure of feeding activities in real time.
These behavioral monitoring systems will interface with external Smart control modules that provide
programmable open- and closed-loop control of environmental variables, such as temperature and light, and
that will be coupled to genetic systems for acute manipulation of gene expression and neuron activity in
response to specific behaviors. During the R61 phase, we will also develop experimental and statistical tools to
analyze high-dimensional -omic profiles, which will be used to identify molecular mechanisms that shape and
are shaped by social interactions and aging. A series of Goals and Milestones will ensure that this new
technology supports the requirements for long term husbandry and that it is robust, reliable, and effective for
detecting reasonable differences in behavioral profiles among individuals and groups of individuals. The R33
component of our proposal will use these tools to provide the first detailed characterization of age-dependent
socio-environment interactions in an influential model system for aging research, and we will evaluate their
association with mechanisms of slowed aging. Importantly, our research will also begin dissecting the
mechanisms underlying how aging modulates social interactions and how these interactions modulate aging.
We will accomplish this by exploiting our ability to dynamically stimulate and inhibit individual neurons in
live, behaving animals to identify the molecular mechanisms through which behavioral interactions influence
lifespan and to evaluate behavioral and molecular interventions that reverse the deleterious consequences of
adverse social conditions. Measures of resilience in metabolome profiles will enable us to link relationships
between social interactions and aging to specific functional cellular pathways. The technology and
experimental paradigms that we develop will push the limits of behavioral monitoring and analysis in any
organism, will offer the first glimpses of mechanisms through which behavioral interactions influence aging in
Drosophila, and will provide a foundation for future investigation in other species, including humans."
11143327,"Summary
A social gradient in health and aging is well established in humans; the greater the social connectedness and
socioeconomic status (SES), the lower the burden of a plethora of diseases and mortality rate. Consistently, lack
of social support and low SES are among the major negative determinants of health, increasing the prevalence
and/or anticipating the onset of diseases. Unfortunately, diseases often only manifest at old age when
therapeutic options and biological flexibility are limited. Additionally, the causal role of social context on aging is
difficult to ascertain, requiring an experimental design in which social factors can be randomized to infer
causation, which is unethical and often not feasible in humans. The evolutionary conserved role of social
determinants of health and aging (SDoHA) and the ability to conduct randomized experimental designs in social
mammals, offer the opportunity to reverse-translate observations made in humans to other animals. In particular,
the use of laboratory mice has several advantages to study the effect of social factors on aging, including: their
comparatively short lifespan when compared to other mammals enabling the completion of longevity studies in
a reasonable timeframe; the ability to conduct intent-to-treat randomization designs of socio-behavioral variables;
they are amenable to sophisticated genetic manipulations. However, the role of SDoHA is often neglected in
biomedical aging research using mice, thus missing critical components of human aging. The objectives of this
project are to: (i) develop rigorous socio-behavioral models suitable for aging studies in male and female mice;
(ii) develop innovative assessment tools and a “comprehensive aging index” summarizing the global impairment
in behavior, physical functions and physiology, and a that can predict functional impairment and longevity, (iii)
identify social factors affecting individual variability in aging processes, and finally (iv) identify socio-behavioral
intervention strategies to increase resilience. The R61 – development, proof-of-concept phase has 2 Aims. Aim
1 will identify social factors affecting the pace of aging by using a randomized design that manipulates social
connectedness, social stability and social stress. We will also develop quantitative assessment tools relevant for
aging research. Aim 2 will develop a “comprehensive aging index”, an algorithm which is based on quantifiable
behavioral, physical and physiological changes over the lifecourse. The R33 – implementation phase has 2 Aims.
Aim 3 will determine whether social rank, social instability and/or social deprivation affect lifespan in male and
female mice and will implement the algorithm to predict longevity based on data collected during the lifecourse.
Aim 4 will implement behavioral strategies designed to increase resilience, including social rank reversal, social
integration and cognitive stimulation/environmental enrichment. At its completion, this project will develop novel
experimental paradigms and assessment tools with far reaching impact to the field. It will also generate an
unprecedented new knowledge on how social factors affect health trajectories and aging, and which aging
process is amenable to intervention versus those that are not amenable to intervention."
11143528,"Project Summary
 Essential tremor (ET) is the most prevalent movement disorder affecting approximately 25 million people
worldwide. Up to sixty-two percent of patients with ET develop vocal tremor (VT) involving oscillation within the
respiratory, laryngeal, pharyngeal-oral, or velopharyngeal-nasal subsystems. These oscillations produce
modulation of the fundamental frequency (pitch) and intensity (loudness) of the voice, resulting in a ‘shaky’
voice and increased effort during speech production. Neurological voice disorders like VT are detrimental to
communication, professional productivity, and quality of life. Unfortunately, the current approaches for medical
management of VT have inconsistent effects on voice production and can have adverse effects. Furthermore,
current methods for behavioral management of VT do not target specific impairments and employ a wide range
of therapeutic techniques leading to inefficient therapy. The challenges in managing VT stem from a lack of
accessible assessment methods to identify the subsystems affected by tremor and guide targeted treatment.
 Clinical assessment of VT requires the use of nasolaryngoscopy to identify oscillation within the larynx and
vocal tract (i.e., pharyngeal-oral and velopharyngeal-nasal subsystems). However, access to
nasolaryngoscopy outside of large voice centers is limited by cost, time, and training demands. Furthermore,
nasolaryngoscopy cannot be used to identify oscillation within the respiratory subsystem, necessitating the
addition of visual and tactile or respiratory kinematic assessments. Although standard acoustical assessments
can be employed in a variety of settings at low cost, current acoustical analyses of microphone signals cannot
differentiate the subsystems affected by tremor because a combination of laryngeal source and vocal tract filter
features are represented.
 Our recent study on vocal vibrato (i.e., a singing technique that involves modulation of voice similar to VT)
used a vibration sensor applied to the neck surface in singers to capture features of the source prior to vocal
tract filtering. Analyses of simultaneously recorded vibration sensor and microphone signals revealed distinct
patterns in the extent of intensity modulation thought to be related to differences in singers’ involvement of the
respiratory system, larynx, and vocal tract in vibrato. In addition, preliminary studies in computational models
and speakers with VT showed distinct patterns of modulation based on the physiological source of tremor.
Thus, the proposed study aims to determine if simultaneously recorded neck-skin vibration sensor and head-
mounted microphone signals differentiate the subsystems involved in voice modulation in singers producing
vibrato as a model of VT and in speakers with VT. Furthermore, the proposed study aims to determine if
vibration sensor and microphone signals capture the effects of laryngeal botulinum toxin injections in speakers
with VT. The findings of this study may address the critical need to advance assessment of VT, facilitate
individualized and targeted treatments for speakers with VT, and measure patients’ responses to treatment."

sciences. The Center for Serological Testing to Improve Outcomes from Pandemic COVID-19 (STOP-COVID) is
proposed as a transdisciplinary entity to understand the interface between exposure risk, transmission, immune
responses, disease severity, protection, and barriers to testing/vaccination, with the goal of improving population
health and clinical outcomes. The Center will utilize state-of-the-art serological and molecular tests, developed
at OSU, in a longitudinal study of first responders, a group at continual high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, as
well as their household contacts. Through the proposed work, STOP-COVID investigators will understand critical
aspects of: (i) transmission in both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, (ii) immune, host, and viral
determinants of disease outcome, and (iii) factors associated with immune protection. Center investigators will
also identify best practices for communication of test results and information about COVID-19 to improve
understanding of risk, transmission, and protection, while reducing access barriers to testing. The Center to
STOP-COVID will: Aim 1 Develop Institute Infrastructure through three shared resource cores: 1. An
Administrative Core that provides overall direction and leadership, coordinating all Center activities as well as
Project–Core–SeroNet interactions; 2. A Testing and Biorepository Core, whose role is to perform first-tier

11127820,"Sepsis, a dysregulated host response to infection with high morbidity and mortality, is characterized by a
systemic inflammatory response and widespread vascular hyperpermeability leading to edema, organ
dysfunction, and death. Lung vascular hyperpermeability in sepsis contributes to acute respiratory distress
syndrome (ARDS), with no specific prevention or treatment strategies. Disruption of the microvascular
endothelial cell (MVEC) barrier is a critical pathological feature of sepsis-induced lung injury driven by
circulating inflammatory mediators, oxidants, and proteolytic enzymes. Our group has shown that plasma
cell-free hemoglobin (CFH), released during sepsis due to red blood cell fragility, is a mechanistic driver of
acute lung injury through induction of lung MVEC hyperpermeability. However, the cellular and molecular
mechanisms are unknown. One potential mechanism by which CFH may disrupt the MVEC barrier is
through its known ability to oxidize low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). OxLDL binds and signals through its
major endothelial receptor lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor 1 (LOX-1) to cause endothelial dysfunction.
LOX-1 activation has been implicated in cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis but its
involvement in MVEC hyperpermeability during sepsis is unknown. Our preliminary data from patients with
sepsis show that circulating CFH and oxLDL are tightly correlated with each other, MVEC injury markers,
and mortality. However, little is known regarding LOX-1 receptor signaling leading to hyperpermeability,
especially in the context of sepsis-induced injury to the lung microvasculature. This proposal aims to test
the central hypothesis that MVEC hyperpermeability and lung injury during sepsis are mediated through
oxidation of LDL by CFH to induce LOX-1 receptor signaling and ectodomain shedding."

Updates: I am moving to a new position at Dartmouth College as an independent, tenure-track Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. Here I will conduct the R00 phase experiments and develop my own independent research program. The overall aims of the R00 phase have not changed from the K99 proposal.
Identifying the neural circuit mechanisms underlying both homeostatic and uncontrolled motivation are crucial for developing more targeted and effective therapeutic treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders like major depression or bipolar disorder. Within mesolimbic brain reward circuitry, the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a major regulator of both reward and aversion. While generally reduced to its dopamine projection neurons, the VTA also contains neurons that co-release inhibitory GABA and excitatory glutamate and, similar to dopamine projections, can modulate motivation. However, the functional role of this GABA/glutamate co-release is still not well understood, and major questions regarding their role in positive vs. negative reinforcement remain. In particular, why would neurons simultaneously send an inhibitory and excitatory signal? During the R00 phase, I will unify my prior expertise with newly acquired skills to determine the physiological and behavioral role of a newly-described VTA GABA/glutamate projection to amygdala. Using in vivo calcium imaging, I will first monitor activity of VTA GABA/glutamate terminals in amygdala during an effort-based instrumental sucrose task (Aim 1), and will then identify the net effect of optogenetically stimulating VTA GABA/glutamate terminals on cell-defined amygdala populations (Aim 2). These results will significantly expand our understanding of the role of VTA co-release in complex motivated behavior relevant to models of bipolar disorder and depression, and will crucially pave the way for more targeted approaches that form the basis my independent research program."

Health, propose to implement the Achieving the Right to Optimal Sexual and
Reproductive Wellbeing Among Racial/Ethnic and Sexual/Gender Minorities in
Mississippi, The SRWB Project. The SRWB Project will be designed to address the
reproduced healthcare needs adults of reproductive age (18 to 45 years old) who
identify as racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minorities in the largely rural state of
Mississippi,
 The project aims to end racialized prioritization of need in the state, and as such,
uses more complex markers of social vulnerability to identify priority areas in the state
where racial/ethnic and sexual/gender minorities are more vulnerable based on
comprehensive social and maternal vulnerability indices. Our approach, a community-
based participatory approach, ensures that the very lives we aim to improve have the
leading voice in prioritizing the structural factors that need to be addressed and the
health outcomes that need to be measured. The proposed project will potentially
address key structural factors related to the availability of non-discriminatory healthcare
services and resources. We will address two core areas including healthcare laws and
regulations, and organization environment. Access to safe, non-discriminatory care is a
key initial step to address reproductive and sexual health priorities, including maternal
health and HIV/STD incidence, in Mississippi."
11138331,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This is an application for an R21/R33 award titled “Smartphone-based community screening of anterior eye
diseases in rural India.” The investigators from Johns Hopkins University and Aravind Eye Hospital have diverse
expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical engineering, machine learning, epidemiology, biostatistics, and use of
mobile health technology in low-resource settings. 90% of the world’s 275 million blind and visually impaired
people live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Cataract, refractive error, corneal opacities, and other
anterior eye diseases account for the majority of global blindness. In rural LMIC settings, lack of access to highly
trained eye care providers such as ophthalmologists is a key barrier to timely diagnosis and treatment for anterior
eye diseases. Periodic “eye camp” screenings performed by highly trained ophthalmologists have been the
mainstay of rural eye disease screening for many decades but have several limitations including lack of access
to trained ophthalmologists, failure to reach the most remote communities, lack of consistent calendar coverage
beyond eye camp dates, and high costs due to equipment, personnel, and community publicity. We propose
development, validation, and implementation of a novel smartphone based device for community health worker
(CHW)-led screening, diagnosis, and referral for eye diseases in rural LMIC settings. We will develop this
smartphone platform using iterative prototyping and user-centered design approaches. After demonstrating
feasibility, we will evaluate the diagnostic validity of CHW-led screenings using the smartphone platform
compared to traditional in-person eye camp exams by an ophthalmologist. After collecting sufficient data and
images using the platform, we will design, validate, and implement machine learning algorithms to permit real-
time diagnosis and referral decisions by CHWs without dependence on ophthalmologists. This project will
perform detailed data collection regarding referral patterns, loss to follow-up, cost-effectiveness, and differential
outcomes among vulnerable groups in order to enable more targeted health interventions. This project is
intended to overcome key longstanding geographic, financial, operational, and human resource constraints to
eye screening while ensuring diagnostic validity, quality control, and interoperability with existing health system
infrastructure. Our scalable approach has potential to transform global eye care delivery in low-resource settings.
This collaboration will also result in permanent improvements in mobile health and research capacity at Aravind
Eye Hospital."
11138804,"One-third of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the United States (US) live
alone. Previous studies have shown that older adults with ADRD who live alone have high risk for health
threats. Because they lack cohabitants, who typically provide most of informal unpaid LTSS, older adults with
ADRD living alone often have limited access to LTSS, which increases their distress. This also increases costs
for unnecessary hospitalizations and institutionalizations. Therefore, the large population of older adults with
ADRD living alone likely has large-scale underserved needs that constitute an urgent public health problem,
but little is known about their access to, and use of, essential LTSS. Moreover, strategies for increasing access
to LTSS are largely lacking and unknown. These knowledge gaps impede development, and thus
implementation, of policies to ensure access to essential LTSS to older adults with ADRD living alone,
especially with respect to racial/ethnic minorities who have increased risk of ADRD vs. Whites, often live alone
and often have worse access to services. This project's objective is thus to elucidate specific barriers and
facilitators to access to and use of LTSS among older adults with ADRD living alone vs those with ADRD living
with others, and to compare how these barriers and facilitators may differ among racial/ethnic groups. We will
then apply this knowledge to develop policy recommendations to increase access to and use of LTSS,
emphasizing racial/ethnic minorities and older adults living alone. Building on the Goldberg-Huxley model, we
will leverage our preliminary studies to conduct a longitudinal mixed-method study with convergent and
independent quantitative (Aim 1) and qualitative aims (Aim 2) in Years 1-3, followed by a policy aim (Aim 3) in
Years 4-5. The design and promise of this project were endorsed by our Community Advisory Board. Our
interdisciplinary team's expertise in aging alone, LTSS, ADRD, health disparities, and policy positions us well
to achieve the aims. The Specific Aims are: 1) To quantify multi-level barriers and facilitators of LTSS use
among older adults with ADRDs and the extent to which these predictors of LTSS use vary by living
arrangement (living alone vs. living with others) and race/ethnicity. 2) To elucidate in depth the barriers and
facilitators to accessing and using LTSS via semi-structured interviews with older adults with ADRD,
informants, and LTSS providers and administrators. 3) To develop policy recommendations to increase access
to and use of LTSS among older adults with ADRD, emphasizing racial/ethnic minorities and older adults living
alone. Our findings will inform development of policies to enhance the performance of LTSS in the US.
Findings will support policies to increase access, affordability, acceptance, and use of essential LTSS for older
adults with ADRD, especially those living alone and racial/ethnic minorities. Thus, the proposed project will
likely reduce health disparities. Furthermore, this project will likely reduce unnecessary hospitalizations and
institutionalizations, which will enhance the wellbeing of older adults with ADRD and reduce costs."

Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a neglected, prevalent, chronic, stigmatizing, and debilitating disease that has
recently been prioritized for study by NIAMS. Evidence suggests that some HS patients choose to self-manage
symptoms remaining unconnected to healthcare, and some seek medical care for repeated outbreaks of boils
but never receive a diagnosis. Such ‘hidden populations’ create challenges for designing research studies that
are generalizable. Precision medicine initiatives and resources offer opportunities to rapidly increase our
knowledge about biological causes of HS and to improve the care that HS patients receive. For example, the
NIH has made considerable investments in the development of data repositories that link genetic data to EHR
for hundreds of thousands of patients, including the NHGRI-funded eMERGE Network and the NIH-funded All
of Us Research Program. Columbia University investigators are integral members of these nationwide programs,
both as a recruitment site, as well as a data and research center (5U01HG008680, 1OT2OD026556). Engaging
research participants who are willing to contribute longitudinal data is a major obstacle to precision medicine
initiatives. The public’s use of the Internet and social media to obtain and exchange health-related information
has created opportunities to rapidly and efficiently assemble large longitudinal cohorts, yet there are important
differences from traditional research methods and best practice guidelines have yet to be developed. Columbia
University is at the forefront of the development and application of these methods. A major challenge to
implementing precision medicine arises from patients who share a diagnosis but have different biological causes
of disease. HS patients have a high burden of comorbidities and we hypothesize that sets of comorbidities that
tend to present together in individual patients can be used to identify biologically relevant disease subtypes. Here
we will use three approaches to identify patterns of comorbidities within patients, to characterize the
generalizability of the results from studies conducted in EHR, and to use genetic data to biologically validate
comorbidities and resolve causality underlying disease associations. Training in biomedical informatics and
Internet-based survey research will allow the applicant to use EHR data and Internet resources for assembling
cohorts to conduct these studies, and complement her previous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, molecular
biology and human genetics, providing fluency across several domains that are crucial for advancing precision
medicine initiatives. Completion of this proposal will achieve the applicant’s long-term goal of obtaining advanced
training aimed at implementing precision medicine in the treatment of skin disease."

neuropathological alterations, 2) identify and characterize proximal biomarkers of NPC1 then 3) investigate
multiple biomarkers, representing different aspects of NPC1 neuropathology, to provide prognostic information
that can be used in parental counseling and to stratify this heterogeneous disorder for therapeutic trials. Our

developed and easily transferrable methods. Our long-term goal is to utilize these biomarkers as indicators of
response in future clinical trials."
11177227,"SUMMARY: 
Salmonella is the leading cause of bacterial foodborne poisoning with significant public health implications 
worldwide. Poultry products (eggs and poultry meat) are humans' main source of Salmonella infections. Human 
Salmonella serotypes do not cause disease in birds, which serve as the reservoir, but colonize their intestines. 
Salmonella can enter the human food chain during processing and humans can be exposed to infection through 
direct contact with infected poultry carcasses. Currently, Salmonella infections are controlled by antibiotics and/or 
vaccination; however, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella strains is a growing source of 
concern. Additionally, live Salmonella vaccines are not effective at reducing food poisoning and they raise the 
risk of live bacteria entering the human food chain. Untreated Salmonella infections have been linked to a variety 
of chronic health issues such as colon and gallbladder cancers. According to the American Cancer Society, 
gallbladder and colon cancers have been associated with infections with two Salmonella serovars, S. Typhi and 
S. Enteritidis, respectively. Therefore, there is a critical need for antibiotic alternatives to control Salmonella 
infection in poultry and to mitigate the risk of Salmonella food poisoning, antimicrobial resistance, and cancer in 
humans. Quorum sensing autoinducer-2 (QS AI-2) plays a critical role in the pathogenicity, virulence, biofilm 
formation, motility, genetic competence, sporulation, and antibiotic production of several bacteria including 
Salmonella. Therefore, inhibition of QS AI-2 activity using QS inhibitors (QSI) is a potentially novel strategy for 
antibacterial development. Since QSIs do not interfere with the metabolic processes of a bacterial cell such as 
protein synthesis, DNA metabolism, and cell wall formation, which are the targets for the development of drug 
resistance, QSIs will not exert selection pressure on the bacteria during treatment, thus bacteria are less likely 
to develop resistance. We hypothesize that breaking the bacterial “conversation” by using QSIs makes 
pathogens less virulent and thus more susceptible to host immune responses. Through the screening of 1,900 
compounds to identify the QS/AI-2 inhibitors against S. Typhimurium, we identified 10 compounds that inhibited 
the QS/AI-2 production of S. Typhimurium (􀂕95%; at 10􀂗M final concentration) without affecting bacterial growth. 
We compared the efficacy of these 10 compounds to the benchmark QSIs identified in previous studies and 
found that our compounds are more effective at lower concentrations. In this proposal, we will (Aim 1) identify 
and evaluate the efficacy of the selected QSIs in vitro, (Aim 2) evaluate the efficacy of the lead QSIs in infected 
3D human intestinal pluripotent stem cell-derived organoids and in the reservoir animal host (chickens), and 
(Aim 3) identify the drug target(s) of the selected leads using drug-target binding studies. Completion of these 
aims will contribute towards our long-term objective of developing new anti-Salmonella therapeutics that control 
the emergence of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella associated with poultry production and mitigate the risk of food 
poisoning and gallbladder and colon cancers in humans."

11133242,"SUMMARY
Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a critical congenital heart malformation that typically requires intervention soon
after birth and affects about 1,660 newborns per year in the US. In TOF, blood flow through the pulmonary
artery is reduced or blocked (due to pulmonary stenosis or atresia), while blood flow through the aorta is
increased. Prenatally, TOF-induced abnormal blood flow progressively leads to pathological cardiac valve
tissue remodeling. The semilunar (aortic and pulmonary) valve leaflets and the great arteries (the aorta and
pulmonary artery) are particularly susceptible to abnormal blood flow. This is because fetal stages are a critical
time when extracellular matrix components that dictate valve integrity and function, such as collagen and
elastin, deposit and organize within valve tissues, and smooth muscle cells are differentiating and organizing in
supporting arteries. However, how semilunar valves and great arteries remodel in response to TOF-induced
abnormal hemodynamic loads during fetal stages remains unknown.
To address this knowledge gap, this project will use a chick embryonic model of TOF that reproduces the
characteristic heart morphologies and flow patterns found in human fetuses with TOF. Avian embryos are
amenable to in vivo imaging and allow tightly controlled longitudinal studies in ovo. Moreover, valve leaflets in
human and chick exhibit the same characteristic layers, which similarly arrange in response to blood flow cues
during fetal development in human and pre-hatching in chick. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is
that before birth abnormal blood flow in TOF leads to aberrant, disorganized deposition of collagen and elastin
fibers in semilunar valve leaflets, and abnormal smooth muscle cell localization in supporting great artery
tissues. Three aims are proposed: 1) Determine characteristic blood flow patterns in fetal hearts with TOF
using advanced in vivo imaging and computational modeling; 2) Assess abnormal tissue remodeling
of semilunar valves and great arteries in TOF through a combination of advanced multiscale
microscopy; 3) Develop predictive models of flow-induced semilunar valve remodeling in TOF.
Through a novel combination of multiscale imaging and computational modeling, this project will elucidate how
TOF-induced abnormal blood flow leads to (and exacerbates) semilunar valve and great artery tissue
anomalies. In the future, findings from this project will improve fetal diagnosis and prediction of prenatal
pathological valve remodeling, enabling better decisions of when and how to intervene to avoid or even
reverse pathological valve remodeling, and will inform valve regeneration efforts."

11172017,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) accounts for 6% of all deaths worldwide and is potentially
preventable, with well-described but poorly elucidated childhood origins. Our research team recently identified
that the mismatch between airway tree caliber and lung volume that arises early in life, dysanapsis, is: 1)
prevalent among older adults when measured by computed tomography (CT), 2) is a major predictor of COPD
risk – exceeding tobacco smoke and other established risk factors, and 3) is not fully explained by genetics. We
also know that there are heterogenous structural presentations of dysanapsis. Variation in dysanapsis, and
COPD risk, may have early life, environmental causes. Research has revealed that two early risk factors,
obesity and viral respiratory infections, contribute to two distinct subtypes of dysanapsis that have yet to be
examined. Several studies have also examined the impact of early-life air pollution exposure on lung function
and growth, with limited generalizability due to the use of racially/ethnically homogenous populations and not
accounting for neighborhood-level social factors as effect modifiers.
This R01 study will leverage 8 longitudinal birth cohorts of diverse children to examine the relationship
between early-life exposures and both the structural (imaging-assessed) and functional (spirometry-
assessed) determinants of dysanapsis throughout childhood and adolescence to identify modifiable risk
factors and help reduce risk of COPD in future generations at risk. Building on our preliminary data showing
that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is as accurate as CT at identifying dysanapsis, we will integrate state-
of-the-art lung MRI data with extensive early-life exposure and lung function data. Aim 1 will establish
relationships between early life dysanapsis (functionally-confirmed) and childhood lung function trajectories, and
their relationship to dysanapsis (functionally- and structurally-confirmed) at late adolescence. Aim 2 will
determine if obesity and viral infections contribute to distinct structural subtypes of dysanapsis (structurally-
confirmed). Aim 3 will examine early life air pollution exposures and neighborhood social factors association with
dysanapsis (functionally-confirmed) in diverse cohorts of children. This study aligns with NHLBI's strategic
objective to investigate factors accounting for health differences among populations. We will establish the early
life risk factors that contribute to airway-to-lung phenotypes and enhance our understanding of the utility of both
structural- and functional-based measures of dysanapsis. Ultimately, our findings will inform targeted
interventions to high-risk groups of children to reduce their subsequent risk of COPD."
11172039,"Driving lymphoid potential in multipotent hematopoietic progenitors by linker histones
Abstract
Functionally impaired hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) often display differentiation skewed
toward the myeloid lineage, underlying disease states such as myeloproliferation, inflammation and cancer1-3.
The molecular mechanisms responsible for the myeloid versus lymphoid decision within the multipotent HSPCs
remains poorly understood, and intervention strategies to boost lymphopoiesis are limited. Chromatin organizes
as DNA wrapping around the core nucleosomes, with linker histones binding to the nucleosome dyad. Linker
histone binding stabilizes nucleosomes, compacts chromatin, reduces accessibility, and is enriched in
heterochromatic regions. We have generated a doxycycline (Dox) inducible H1.0 overexpression transgene
(iH1.0). Using this mouse model, we discovered that H1.0 overexpression in HSPCs leads to dramatically
expanded lymphoid biased and committed progenitors as well as more mature lymphocytes in circulation. Based
on the strong lymphoid differentiation potential of H1.0+ HSPCs, we aim to define a molecular pathway that
regulates the lineage output of multipotent HSPCs by linker histones via three specific aims. Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that either a specific linker histone isoform, i.e. H1.0, or the abundance of total H1, drive the lymphoid
potential of multipotent HSPCs, by examining the lineage potential of various H1 null and re-expression models.
Aim 2 will address how lineage specificality is accomplished, as H1s do not have sequence specificity. Our
preliminary data show that H1.0 overexpression leads to sharply reduced chromatin accessibility at the Hepatic
Leukemia Factor (Hlf) gene, and reduced Hlf mRNA expression. As Hlf has strong myeloid-promoting effect, we
will test whether linker histone promotes lymphoid potency by restricting chromatin accessibility at this myeloid-
specifying factors to reduce its expression. As our preliminary data show that H1.0 protein undergoes aspartyl
protease-dependent turnover, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that inhibiting aspartyl proteases prevents the drop
in H1.0 protein and sustains lymphoid differentiation potency. The effects of several inhibitors of the HIV
protease, an aspartyl protease, on the endogenous H1.0 and lymphopoiesis will be examined. This proposal will
yield novel insights on how lymphoid fate specification is controlled by nucleosome/chromatin compaction via
linker histones, and approaches to adjust the hematopoietic lineage output for therapeutic gains."

11171026,"1 Abstract
 2 The negative impact of SARS-CoV-2 worldwide has been astronomical in many different ways, impacting on all
 3 aspects of society. Up to date more than 13 million infections and over 600,000 deaths have already been
 4 accounted for. The current lack of understanding of the modulation of the immune response by the virus is a
 5 dominant factor in the absence of effective prophylactic, therapeutic approaches which can ameliorate virus
 6 transmission and mortality. COVID-19 disease is greatly heterogeneous in incidence and clinical course, due in
 7 part to ethnic background, age and pre-existing clinical conditions. Severe COVID19 and increased death rate
 8 has been reported in cancer patients and in African-Americans (AA). One common feature among these
 9 populations is the heightened basal level of inflammation that could synergize with the SARS-COV-2 driven
10 inflammation leading to poor clinical outcomes. This pro-inflammatory milieu will exacerbate the lymphopenia
11 already prevalent in COVID-19 disease and which could lead to disrupted T cell homeostasis, poor T cell help
12 and lack of survival of the memory T and B cell compartments. A central corollary of the current proposal is
13 that individuals with underlying immune dysregulation, such as in cancer, will have abnormal responses
14 to COVID-19, mediating poor short-term outcomes and impairment of long term immune memory. To
15 address this directly, we have access to well-powered cohorts of subjects, including high representation of AA,
16 with lung cancer and B cell lymphomas. Our strategy will generate precise quantification of the B cell response
17 at the functional (neutralization, effector function) and cellular level (deep phenotyping of B cell/plasmablasts,
18 diversity of BCR sequences). State-of-the-art assays including single cell RNAseq, CITEseq, ATACseq, high
19 density flow cytometry, cytokine array, circulating metabolites and microbiome will provide high dimensional
20 analysis of the inflammatory milieu in cancer subjects and its impact on innate and Tfh function as well as
21 longevity of B cell and T cell memory responses. Integration of these measures of B cell function (Aim 1) with
22 those generated from the OMICs data (Aim 2-3) will contribute to the identification of the mechanistic
23 underpinnings that enhance disease severity in the context of cancer. Specifically, we propose to:
24 1) Analyze the dynamics and durability of antigen-specific B cell responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection
25 in cancer patients compared to patients without cancer
26 2) identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms triggered by the inflammatory environment prevalent
27 in cancer patients during acute infection which impairs humoral responses during COVID-19
28 3) Identify the epigenetic and transcriptional mechanisms triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or
29 microbial translocation that will impede on the longevity of memory B and Tfh cells.

11171048,"Project 3 SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is the most common and aggressive type of epithelial ovarian cancer,
and the mortality rates remain unacceptably high. It is well documented that aberrant angiogenesis occurs in the
tumor microenvironment (TME) and angiogenesis inhibitors are important for cancer therapy. However, the
clinical benefit of bevacizumab (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) targeted antibody) has been limited
due to rapid emergence of resistance in most patients with ovarian cancer. Moreover, therapies targeting the
VEGF signaling pathway can also result in adverse events and interfere with wound healing since VEGF is
known to be also important for physiological angiogenesis. Thus, new targets and approaches aimed at the TME
for improving therapeutic outcomes are needed. We identified epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain
multiple 6 (EGFL6) as the most differentially expressed gene in tumor endothelial cells compared to endothelial
cells from normal ovarian tissues and healing wounds. Our preliminary data suggest that high EGFL6 expression
in tumors is associated with an immune suppressive TME with high M2 macrophage infiltration. To develop a
therapeutic approach for blocking EGFL6, we developed and tested a large number of candidate antibodies; the
final candidates have been humanized. Our in vivo results indicated that these antibodies had robust anti-tumor
effects and reduced angiogenesis in ovarian cancer models. Based on our compelling preliminary data, we
hypothesize that EGFL6 promotes aberrant angiogenesis, and immune suppression, resulting in ovarian cancer
growth and progression. Blocking EGFL6 with a monoclonal antibody provides a novel and effective approach
for treatment of ovarian cancer. We will test our hypothesis under three Aims: 1) To delineate the molecular
regulation of EGFL6 and identify sources of EGFL6 in the tumor microenvironment; 2) To investigate the
biological effects of anti-EGFL6 monoclonal antibody as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy, anti-
VEGF antibody, or immune checkpoint inhibitor; and 3) To determine the safety and tolerability of an anti-EGFL6
antibody in a first-in-human, first-in-class phase I clinical trial in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer.
Collectively, the work proposed in this project will provide scientific rationale for developing new anti-EGFL6
based therapies. The proposed studies will provide fundamental mechanistic insights into the role of EGFL6 in
regulating immune responses in the TME. Findings from this proposal could significantly impact the clinical
outcomes of patients with ovarian cancer."
11171135,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Early word learning is a major developmental achievement that rests on a foundation of visual category
learning: to learn that the word “dog” refers to a category dog that includes chihuahuas and excludes wolves,
children must make an impressive visual generalization. However, deep neural networks—our best models of
category learning—are unable to learn from the same visual diet as children, limiting our ability to construct
mechanistic accounts of early category and word learning. While infants learn the categories that words refer
to while experiencing a few categories (e.g., spoons, cups) dramatically more often than others (and while
experiencing certain categories as drawings or illustrations), current models learn from uniform distributions of
categories where exemplars are photos taken from the adult perspective. The proposed work will overcome
these limitations and use deep neural networks to understand how children’s everyday visual experiences
interact with statistical learning mechanisms to yield the category representations that support early word
learning. In Aim 1 (K99 phase), I will determine how variability in children’s visual experiences relates to early
word learning outcomes. To do so, I will collect a representative dataset of the categories in the infant view
using a parent-report measure and photographs taken from the infant perspective, and determine whether
variance in visual experience with different categories predicts which words are learned earlier in development.
In Aim 2 (K99/R00 phase) I will evaluate how well current models and infants learn from diverse sets of
realistic visual inputs using looking-time experiments and model simulations, evaluating whether networks with
more neurally plausible architectures are better predictors of infant learning. In Aim 3 (R00 phase), I will adapt
an existing deep neural network for infant categorization. To do so, I will build output layers on top of a
state-of-the-art unsupervised model of object segmentation to identify the categories in the infant view and to
make principled generalizations from frequently experienced to infrequently experienced but similar
categories—much like young children in early development. The empirical findings and resulting computational
model will provide insight into the relevant visual experiences for learning the categories that words refer to.
This understanding of how typically-developing children learn rapidly and efficiently in everyday environments
is essential to improve interventions for children struggling to learn the categories that words refer to, including
late talkers, children with ASD, and children recovering from blindness (e.g., after cataract surgery). This award
will build upon my strong background in visual category recognition and provide me with relevant training in
both early language acquisition and deep neural networks via interdisciplinary workshops, coursework, and the
scientific expertise of a team of mentors and consultants. This award will thus facilitate my transition to become
an independent investigator at the forefront of cognitive development, vision science, and machine learning."
11171147,"The applicant, Aliza Wingo, M.D., M.Sc., is a board-certified psychiatrist and principal investigator at the
Atlanta VA Medical Center. The first focus of Dr. Wingo’s research is to identify the genetic and molecular
contributors to psychological resilience, PTSD, and depression, respectively. She is keenly aware of the
complex relationships among these three facets of mental condition and also works to identify common and
distinct mechanisms among them. The second focus of Dr. Wingo’s work is to identify how resilience, PTSD,
and depression share common genetic and molecular basis with Alzheimer’s disease dementia. Through
studying psychological constructs, she aims to identify novel pathways for enhancing resilience, treating
PTSD/depression, and identifying novel causes of Alzheimer’s dementia that could be leveraged for new
therapies. This work is currently supported by a Merit Review award from the VA, an R01 from the NIA/NIH,
and a U01 from the NIMH/NIH.
 With regard to resilience, Dr. Wingo has shown that a genetic variant on chromosome 1 (rs322931) and
brain expression level of miR-181 contribute to resilience (Wingo et al, Molecular Psychiatry, 2016). Resilience
here is conceptualized as having high levels of positive emotions and/or sense of life purpose and meaning
after adverse or traumatic life experiences. In her current funded Merit Review, Dr. Wingo examines brain
microRNA profile to identify a microRNA signature of resilience. Next, she will use systems biology approach to
identify brain transcriptomic drivers of resilience using brain transcriptome. Finally, she will examine the
mRNAs and proteins that are downstream targets of the resilience-associated microRNAs with the overall goal
of identifying novel genes regulating resilience.
 Regarding PTSD and depression, Dr. Wingo has shown that DICER1 and microRNA regulation
pathway contributes to PTSD and depression (Wingo et al, Nature Communications, 2016). In this CDTA, Dr.
Wingo proposes to harness deep human brain proteomes quantified by mass spectrometry from post-mortem
brain tissues as a reference to impute brain protein expression level in Veterans who have genotyping. The
imputed protein expression profile is then used for a proteome-wide association study of PTSD and
depression, respectively, to identify proteins in the brain that predispose to PTSD or depression. In addition,
epidemiological studies have observed that offspring of pregnant women suffering from PTSD or depression
have higher risk for developing psychological or behavioral issues later in life. To investigate the mechanisms
behind this intergenerational association, Dr. Wingo has been funded by a U01 to examine offspring’s blood-
based transcriptome and global microRNA profile. These findings are highly relevant to female Veterans who
suffer higher risk for PTSD and depression.
 Regarding dementia, Dr. Wingo has shown that hundreds of proteins in human brain are altered with
cognitive decline in advanced age (Wingo et al, Nature Communications, 2019). Since large epidemiological
studies have observed that depression, especially late-life depression, increases the risk for dementia, Dr.
Wingo is funded by an R01 to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying detrimental effects of depression
and protective effects of life purpose on Alzheimer’s dementia risk using multi-omics data from post-mortem
brain tissues.
 Through studying the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying the conditions that
disproportionally affect our Veterans – PTSD, depression, and Alzheimer’s dementia, Dr. Wingo hopes to
contribute to advancing our understanding of their etiologies to develop novel and effective interventions. As a
long-term goal, Dr. Wingo aspires to carry out novel and innovative research questions to make transformative
impact on the health and resilience of our Veterans."

The goal of this project, “Early podocyte injury in collagen IV nephropathy”, is to understand the earliest events in podocyte injury in Collagen IV nephropathies. The basic hypothesis is that processing of mutant collagen IV proteins injures podocytes at early stages of development, ultimately leading to Chronic Kidney Disease and renal failure (ESRD). The podocyte cell-specific mechanisms of early injury process are not fully understood, but if identified and mitigated early, could defer renal injury and progression to ESRD. Our approach is to use transcriptomic data from extensively phenotyped mouse models mapped to a human database of proteinuric kidney disease (NEPTUNE FSGS and COL4 mutations) to identify similarities and differences and use the model systems to identify the earliest possible points for intervention in Col IV nephropathies. Understanding of how Collagen IV mutations initiate and drive podocyte injury will also be critical in understanding other human glomerular diseases including in human FSGS patients, many of whom have Collagen IV mutations.
Our published and preliminary data from WT and Col4a3-/- mice, and accompanying conditionally immortalized podocytes demonstrate: 1. Suppression of the Alport renal phenotype including early podocyte injury and loss by mitigation of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) with Tauro-Urso-DeoxyCholic Acid (TUDCA), 2. Reduced expression of WNK1 occurs early in Alport nephropathy, 3. Inhibition of WNK1 disrupts podocyte and glomerular architecture, 4. Activation of WNK1 suppresses the Alport phenotype in 4 month Col4a3-/- glomeruli and cultured podocytes, 5. Podocyte injury begins before proteinuria, and renal parenchymal injury begins with its onset and loss of approximately 40% of podocytes, 6. Bulk RNAseq shows that increased expression of cytokines and chemokines coincides with the onset of proteinuria, 7. A list of podocyte enriched genes from NEPTUNE human FSGS single cell data was mapped to mouse orthologs in our mouse bulk-RNA seq data to identify 60 podocyte enriched genes whose magnitude of change was reduced or direction of change was reversed by TUDCA. 8. This group of genes was similar in nature and behavior to gene changes reported in studies of anti-miR21/ACEI treatment of Svj129 Col4a3-/- mice where the Alport phenotype was also suppressed. This group of podocyte enriched genes represents a focused target for reversing or mitigating podocyte injury in these diseases. 
We emphasize two distinct areas of the application: 1) The importance of WNK1 signaling in podocyte cytoskeletal structure and glomerular biology in Alport syndrome 2) The validity of mapping mouse to human transcriptomic data. Our current goal is to generate additional data to resolve these questions. We will expand our preliminary and published data demonstrating that WNK1 has essential and specific roles in glomerular and podocyte structure, and that its level of expression decreases in Col4a3-/- mice. The studies will use WT and Col4a3-/- mice, isolated glomeruli, and cultured cells. We will also expand our work with the NEPTUNE consortium and Col4a3-/- mouse RNAseq data to further strengthen interspecies relationship in Alport Syndrome."

10904645,"SUMMARY
 Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and associated lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are a major cause
of morbidity in aging men, resulting in major economic costs in both direct healthcare expenditure as well as lost
productivity. The pathogenesis of BPH/LUTS is multifactorial. However, current medical BPH treatment generally
follows a scripted format using two approaches: α-adrenergic blockers (α-blockers) to relax muscle tone and 5α-reductase inhibitors (5ARI) to shrink the prostate. Many men fail these medical treatments, resulting in around
120,000 surgical interventions annually in the United States. Common pro-inflammatory co-morbidities include
obesity and diabetes. Inflammation is strongly associated with increased LUTS severity and also with the failure
of existing medical treatments for BPH resulting in progression to surgery. Links between autoimmune
inflammatory (AI) diseases and BPH are now well established with common comorbidities including psoriasis
and rheumatoid arthritis. AI disease patients have around a 50% increase in BPH prevalence. We recently
showed that AI disease treatment, specifically with TNF-antagonists, reduced subsequent BPH diagnoses down
to or even below the baseline population incidence. This effect was not observed with the broad spectrum
immune-suppressant methotrexate. We also showed both suppression of the development of prostate
hyperplasia and the shrinkage of existing enlarged glands in mouse models treated with TNF-antagonists. The
prostates of patients treated with these agents demonstrate reduced proliferation and inflammation. This strongly
suggests that approaches that target immunomodulatory pathways, specifically TNF blockade, may be beneficial
in the prevention and/or treatment of BPH/LUTS. Pathway analysis in TNF-antagonist-treated mouse models
demonstrated that blockade of this pathway reduces antigen presentation and inflammatory signaling
downstream of TNF receptor 2. Overall these changes were consistent with TNF blockade reducing both overall
cellular proliferation and the suppression of apoptosis. There are limited medical options to treat patients with
BPH/LUTS and no new medical treatments have been developed in nearly 30 years. This proposal will test that
idea in a pilot trial with subsequent tissue and genomic analysis to identify pathways that may be concurrently
targeted as well as provide data to assist in future patient stratification. The major impact of this work will be to
test an existing and widely used drug as a possible novel approach to treat BPH. If successful, this work would
set the stage for integrating a new approach with existing therapies for the BPH/LUTS patient population with
large prostates. We will pursue three aims, that will: 1) Evaluate the efficacy of TNF antagonist action in
BPH/LUTS, 2) Define the consequences of TNF antagonist therapy on human prostate tissue, and, 3) Identify
genetic predictors to stratify patients with differential response to TNF antagonists."

11175002,"Project Abstract
Chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO), also known as chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO),
is a severe autoinflammatory bone disease of unknown cause that predominantly affects children and young
adults with debilitating complications and poor quality of life. The incidence rate has risen with increasing
awareness of the disease. First-line treatment of CNO is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
although optimal duration of treatment has not been studied and long-term treatment with NSAIDs has the
potential of serious side effects. There is a need to assess the impact of prolonged treatment on the disease.
Patients who fail NSAIDs or who have high-risk skeletal site involvement most often require second-line
treatment with 1) conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARD), 2) tumor
necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), or 3) bisphosphonates. Data from the prospective CHronic nonbacterial
Osteomyelitis International Registry (CHOIR) and a survey of practicing pediatric rheumatologists showed
widespread use of these three second-line therapies, yet comparative effectiveness of second-line therapies
has not been formally evaluated. CHOIR has already enrolled 364 patients, including 297 patients from eight
U.S. sites, which provides a comprehensive data collection and analysis platform for the comparative
effectiveness research in this proposal. Several disease assessment scores have been proposed including a
composite clinical disease activity score (CDAS) that was validated. Radiographic Activity Index (RAI) based
on whole body MRI has been standardized and will be used as a secondary outcome. Using the CNO CDAS
and CHOIR data we propose to: 1) determine the impact of prolonged treatment of NSAIDs on reducing flare
rate, as defined by a new onset of clinical symptoms after temporary remission and after discontinuation of
NSAIDs in children who are responsive to NSAIDs; 2) compare the effectiveness and safety of TNFi and
bisphosphonates in patients who fail NSAIDs or have high-risk skeletal sites. We hypothesize that 1)
prolonged treatment of NSAIDs is associated with reduced disease flare and, 2) bisphosphonates are non-
inferior to TNFi (±csDMARD). Patients with active CNO will be prospectively enrolled into CHOIR. Detailed
clinical, laboratory, and imaging data will be collected as standard care at baseline and follow up visits.
Results from the proposed studies will determine the optimal duration of treatment with NSAIDs as well as
the effectiveness and safety of current second-line treatments for patients with CNO."
11175006,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Among working-age U.S. adults, diabetic retinopathy remains the leading cause of blindness despite
landmark National Eye Institute (NEI) clinical trials showing that early detection and treatment reduce the risk of
severe vision loss by over 90%. Yet adherence with yearly diabetic retinopathy screening in the U.S remains
below half of patients in rural communities. Ocular telemedicine (i.e. teleophthalmology) can substantially
increase diabetic retinopathy screening rates and prevent blindness. However, there is often very limited use of
this technology even after a teleophthalmology program is established in multi-payer health systems, where the
majority of Americans receive their care. To overcome major barriers identified for teleophthalmology use in rural
multi-payer primary care clinics, the PI developed and piloted Implementation to Sustain Impact in
Teleophthalmology (I-SITE) in a NEI K23 Career Development Award. I-SITE is the first implementation program
specifically designed to overcome barriers to teleophthalmology use by tailoring its integration into rural primary
care clinic workflows. The proposed study is a multi-center randomized controlled trial aiming to: (1) test the
effectiveness of I-SITE, (2) identify explanatory factors and implementation components that distinguish high
and low teleophthalmology use in rural health systems following I-SITE implementation, and (3) evaluate
implementation costs. We hypothesize that I-SITE will sustain significant diabetic eye screening rate increases
at 18 months compared to usual care teleophthalmology.
 This UG1 proposal directly responds to multiple elements of the NEI Strategic Plan, including areas of
emphasis in telemedicine, diabetic retinopathy, and expanding access to eye care in rural populations. This
research will facilitate the effective translation of telemedicine technology in rural multi-payer primary care clinics
to improve diabetic retinopathy screening rates. The effective integration and scale-up of ocular telemedicine
would greatly expand eye care access for millions of rural Americans. This will be critical for preventing avoidable
blindness by overcoming the shortage of eye care providers and meeting the increased demand for eye
screening resulting from major projected increases in diabetes prevalence. As we face
unprecedented challenges to our nation's health systems, never before in our history has the need for a
rapid transition to telehealth been more acute. Our study will provide vital knowledge regarding the
methods and factors needed to successfully translate telehealth technology into widespread clinical
practice for improving public health nationwide."

Title: Regulation of SARS CoV-2 immunity in cancer patients
Project leaders: Madhav Dhodapkar and Rafi Ahmed
Project Summary:
Patients with cancer are at increased risk of morbidity and mortality relating to SARS CoV-2 infection.
However the immunologic underpinnings of wide variance in COVID-19 disease course in cancer
patients are unknown. In addition to underlying cancer associated immune paresis, therapies used to
treat cancer can further increase the risk of COVID related pathology. In this proposal, we have
assembled a multidisciplinary team to tackle these questions. These studies build directly on our prior
expertise and experience in studying immunity in viral infections and cancer. We will focus in
particular on patients with B/plasma cell tumors treated with B/plasma cell depleting therapies and
those with lung cancer treated with immune checkpoint blockade. Studies in aim 1 will evaluate the
impact of therapy-related immune paresis on protective immunity to SARS CoV-2 and viral clearance
in patients with B/plasma cell malignancies. Studies in aim 2 will evaluate anti-viral immunity and
immunopathology in patients with lung cancer receiving immune checkpoint blockade. Studies in aim
3 will evaluate immunologic responses to SARS CoV-2 vaccines in patients with B/plasma cell tumors
and lung cancer once they are approved and administered as a part of standard care. These studies
will not only provide basic insights into protective immunity to SARS CoV-2, but also provide essential
information for optimal care of these patients in the face of concurrent SARS CoV-2 infection."

11170785,"While PARP inhibitors like BMN673 (Talazoparib) have shown significant effectiveness in treating cancers 
with homologous recombination (HR) deficiency, their benefits are limited for HR-proficient cancers. The 
combination of a DNMT inhibitor (DNMTi) such as 5-azacytidine (AZA) with PARPi has been shown to 
enhance efficacy by inducing HR defects. However, the application of this combination is challenged by the 
poor bioavailability and the off-target toxicity of both drugs. Efficiently co-delivering PARPi and DNMTi via 
nanocarriers is complex due to their differing physicochemical properties and the challenge of achieving 
precise tumor targeting. Once entering biological fluids, most NPs acquire a protein corona that dictates 
their biological identity and behavior in the body, complicating the design of nanocarriers for predictable 
and enhanced tumor targeting. In our preliminary studies, we developed a small sized nanocarrier based 
on AZA-conjugated polymer that could efficiently load BMN673. The new formulation was more effective in 
suppressing tumor growth in PARPi-insensitive NSCLC tumor models compared to free drug combinations. 
PAZA nanocarrier demonstrated excellent tumor penetration due to a new mechanism of active targeting 
that involves the recruitment of fibronectin from serum proteins following systemic administration. However, 
the complexity of precisely controlling the protein corona, influenced by variables such as polymer structure 
and molecular weight, poses a significant challenge and impacts the nanocarrier's behavior in biological 
systems. In addition, the current PAZA carrier is non-biodegradable, which may accumulate in the body 
over time, raising concerns about its long-term safety. To address these issues, the first objective is to 
develop biodegradable bPAZA carriers and evaluate the impact of polymer structure on the protein corona 
composition. A detailed understanding of how NPs interact with serum proteins and the impact on 
biodistribution will allow for precise modulation of protein corona. The second objective focuses on 
conjugating cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting EGFR, to a bPAZA carrier exhibiting minimal 
protein corona. By leveraging the benefits of cetuximab's dual role as a targeting agent and a therapeutic, 
the proposed work will provide a new AZA-based nanocarrier with improved specificity and efficiency for 
enhanced PARPi based synthetical lethal therapy."

our research training executive committee. Didactic lectures, research seminars, journal clubs, formal course 
work, attendance at scientific meetings, professional development programs and networking opportunities
supplement an intensively structured research experience. Predoctoral graduates of this comprehensive

11124368,"TRAINING CORE – PROJECT SUMMARY
 The NRSA Training Core TL1 submitted here is in conjunction with the 3 cores of the U2C in this combined 
U2C/TL1 submission. The TL1 will recruit and support outstanding and diverse scholars training in in kidney, 
urology, and hematology research in the San Diego Area. The TL1 represents a collaborative submission 
from 3 major academic research institutions in the region inducing UC San Diego (UCSD), The Scripps 
Research Foundation (TSRI), and San Diego State University. After a 2-year ramp-up, the TL1 will support 10 
scholars (6 pre- and 4 post-doc) annually, with at least 2 dedicated to hematology research, 2 dedicated to 
urology research, and at least 1 from a pediatric background.
 The TL1 draws upon the outstanding pool of available scholars from the 3 institutions, collectively providing 
a very large source of predocs with a high proportion from URM backgrounds, and leverages the state-of-theart training (including two CTSIs) offered at the 3 institutions, combined with additional sources of scholars and 
expertise of outstanding clinical departments in KUH. The 61 TL1 faculty members have been carefully 
recruited not only for their scientific expertise in KUH, but for their commitment to mentorship, and balance in 
regards to focus of research across KUH, basic to clinical, from across the 3 institutions, and for balance by 
gender and URM backgrounds, to foster a training environment with considerable breadth from all 
perspectives. The TL1 is led by 3 MPIs, each representing 1 of the 3 institutions, and each with substantial 
mentorship experience and passion for training the next generation. 
 Preliminary data for this TL1 comes from our recent successes in training post-docs in Nephrology (with 
recent completion of a highly successful T32), and in multiple recent successes in developing scholars to K 
awards and faculty positions at all 3 institutions over the past 5 years. The TL1 now proposes to coalesce 
these successes into a collaborative effort, supported by the outstanding professional development, 
networking, and administrative support from the U2C, to continue these successes, further deepen our 
successes in hematology and urology specifically, and to focus on training across all career stages. The TL1 
has outstanding institutional financial support to bolster training for KUH scholars above and beyond what the 
TL1 can provide, and we have invested heavily in developing opportunities and local grants that can facilitate 
transitions off of TL1 support as the scholars complete their training. Supported by these resources, the TL1 
will provide Aim 4 of the overall U2C/TL1, “to provide outstanding research training in nephrology, urology, and 
hematology to highly talented trainees who are diverse in terms of their prior scientific and medical disciplines 
of training, demography, and career stage.”"
11124404,"The goal of the Harvard Kidney, Urology and Hematology Training Institute’s (HKUHTI) Training Program is to 
educate the next generation of diverse leaders of KUH research by leveraging the intellectual, collaborative, and 
physical resources of our rich Boston ecosystem. Five partnering institutions request support for a TL1 
Training Core to fund 10 pre- and 24 postdoctoral trainees in the steady state of the grant (after some 
adjustments in the first year taking into account the end of existing T32 grants). Trainees will benefit from 
HKUHTI-specific, as well as Harvard-wide, collaborative training curricular offerings that will be tailored to the 
trainee’s individual scientific and career goals. The TL1 will be led by Dr. Anna Greka, who is part of the 
leadership for the Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS) Graduate Program at HMS and the Leadership 
Council of the Harvard-MIT MD-PhD Program. The HKUHTI will employ a rigorous selection process that will 
result in a highly diverse group of trainees from across the country into a program that provides rigorous training 
with a world-class roster of mentors in KUH fields. Trainees will benefit from a primary mentor, and an individual 
oversight committee (IOC) throughout their tenure in the program. The HKUHTI will expose trainees to a range 
of innovative research opportunities including those offered by established mentors at the Broad and Wyss 
Institutes, MIT and others, and will leverage the clinical and translational research accelerator, the Harvard 
Catalyst. The TL1 will address many identified challenges to training the next generation of KUH research leaders 
and will build on a strong history of success in producing and retaining leaders in KUH biomedical sciences.
The requested positions will bring together K, U, and H across pediatric and adult divisions. The TL1 is closely 
linked to the U2C, incorporating rich Professional Development and Network Cores, and the supported trainees 
will benefit from a robust Administrative Core with a digital Hub, oversight committees and evaluation 
infrastructure. Formalized structures are established for recruitment, selection, and retention, as well as 
mentor and trainee selection and evaluation. Special attention will be devoted to enabling trainees to 
overcome experimental and personal hurdles in their training. The TL1 will focus on offering trainees the 
knowledge needed to perform state-of-the-art science and prepare for a productive and rewarding career 
in KUH fields. Additionally, the TL1 is structured to provide oversight to trainees and ensure that trainee, 
mentor(s) and IOC co-develop an Individualized Training Plan in a cooperative manner, such that the needs, 
emerging research interests and future career of the trainee are always at the center of their training experience.
The structure of the TL1 program was intentionally designed to address seven major challenges identified by 
surveying the trainees (see Training Plan). In addition, the HKUTHI will benefit from validated evaluation tools to 
collect data and address emerging trends and scientific challenges to ensure that trainees, mentors and the 
entire HKUHTI community achieve measurable personal, professional and scientific growth.

11126200,"Summary
We propose to create a comprehensive training program that encompasses research training in science related 
to kidney, benign urology, and benign hematology across the lifespan entitled the Philadelphia Program for 
Mentored Research Training in Kidney, Urologic, and Hematologic Diseases (PERFORM-KUH). Leveraging the 
physical proximity and the history of interinstitutional and interdisciplinary training and collaboration, PERFORMKUH is uniquely positioned to build/enhance a biomedical research training program that integrates well-established training programs at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and the Children’s Hospital of 
Philadelphia (CHOP), and pre- and post-doctoral programs at Drexel, Jefferson, and Temple (with affiliated Fox 
Chase Cancer Center) Universities. The primary goal of this program is to develop skilled investigators trained 
to conduct impactful research in clinical, translational, or basic science in KUH, and capable of further developing 
careers as independent researchers. PERFORM-KUH will replace three longstanding T32 training programs 
located at Penn/CHOP, in hematopoiesis, kidney disease, and renal epidemiology, add training in pediatric and 
adult urology research, and importantly, integrate with three partner institutions in Philadelphia. This program 
assembles one hundred and six talented faculty trainers from five institutions, sixteen graduate programs, and 
thirty-eight departments, to create a premiere integrated research training program for KUH trainees in the 
Philadelphia region. PERFORM-KUH is designed to support eight predoctoral and twelve postdoctoral trainees
per year. This request is justified by the historical demand by high-quality applicants for training slots in our 
standing T32s, accommodated by the size and quality of the PERFORM-KUH faculty, large and outstanding 
trainee pools, strong institutional and departmental commitments, and collaborative training environment. The 
PI/PD with focus area advisors and site PIs are well supported by the Steering Committee of the Administrative 
Core consisting of a Recruitment and Admissions committee, Mentorship Oversight subcommittee, and an
External Evaluation Board. Research mentorship is provided by scientifically diverse trainers of all academic 
ranks with research interests that encompass virtually all areas of KUH. The Training Program will leverage 
innovative PERFORM-KUH cores, including its Professional Development Core (PDC), and its Networking Core 
(NWC) that integrate pipeline programs to attract undergraduate, medical, and high school students from 
underrepresented backgrounds. The DEI director is dedicated to minority recruitment and retention efforts in 
PERFORM-KUH research training. The academic elements of the Program include laboratory work, skills 
training, seminars, mentoring and career counseling, presentation, manuscript and grant writing, and peer 
mentoring in collaboration with PDC and NWC. It will offer an integrated core curriculum that includes the 
completion of a formal master’s degree program for MD research fellows. Facilitated by a professional Evaluation 
Director, PERFORM-KUH will be evaluated using systematically collected and formally analyzed data.

Food allergies (FAs) are a world-wide problem, and allergies to multiple foods are particularly problematic. In 
the U.S., ingestion of offending food allergens is the most common cause of anaphylaxis seen in hospital 
emergency departments (EDs), and it is estimated that ~30,000 food-induced anaphylactic events are seen in 
U.S. EDs each year; sadly, ~200 of these events prove fatal. Peanuts or tree nuts cause the majority of these 
deaths, and a recent survey in the U.S. found that 1.4% of the population is allergic to peanuts or tree nuts and 
~30% of patients with FAs have allergies to multiple foods. In peanut allergy (PA), landmark studies by A. 
Wesley Burks and colleagues have shown that children can be desensitized to peanut via an oral 
immunotherapy (OIT) protocol. We have replicated these results in adults and children, and also have carried 
out a pilot study showing that FA patients can be desensitized to multiple food allergens simultaneously (i.e., 
multi-OIT). Moreover, we found that there were fewer adverse events in the build-up phase of multi-OIT if 
patients received the anti-IgE antibody, omalizumab, concomitantly with multi-OIT.
 In an effort to improve understanding of the systemic and local (i.e., GI) immune responses that underlie PA 
and therapeutic responses to OIT, we are currently conducting a placebo-controlled, randomized, phase 2 
clinical trial of OIT in 120 children and adults with PA (the POISED trial), and are applying state-of-the-art 
human immune monitoring methods to analyze blood and GI tissue specimens of participants in that study. In 
this AADCRC U19 renewal application, we propose to conduct a pilot, placebo-controlled, randomized, phase 
2 clinical trial of OIT with or without omalizumab or the anti-IL-4Rα antibody, dupilumab, in children and adults 
with multiple FAs (multi-FAs). We propose to measure a broad range of blood and GI biopsy cellular findings, 
as well as serologic and clinical findings, in longitudinal samples from multi-FA participants undergoing the trial, 
as well as from appropriate control participants (i.e., multi-FA participants who are not treated, healthy controls, 
and atopic controls without FA). We will use these data to define how key systemic or GI tissue immune
parameters change during multi-OIT, and which are most predictive of the nature and durability of patient 
responses to this therapy. Specifically, we will evaluate whether there are blood- or GI tissue-derived 
biomarkers that predict therapeutic responses to individual allergens, or to all allergens, in multi-OIT. In 
addition, we will seek to identify immune monitoring parameters, including findings derived from analyses of 
basophil phenotype and function that can be rapidly performed in a clinical laboratory using small amounts of 
blood, that could be used to predict the clinical reactivity to offending allergens in multi-FA subjects, to improve 
the safety and efficacy of OIT protocols, and/or to tailor the OIT protocol to each individual subject."

11172204,"The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a mission to develop safe and effective contraceptives for women, including obese women and women who may be at risk ofHIV infection. Obesity is the number one public health issue facing the US population and is an independent risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Therefore, there is a public health need to develop effective contraception for obese woman that does not increase the risk ofVTE. The development ofMPTs for prevention of both pregnancy and acquisition ofHIV infection requires evaluation of a combination of drugs in a single formulation or device. Each individual drug will have to be evaluated in the presence of the companion drug(s) in order to ensure that the release rate, effectiveness and safety are not compromised by the presence of another agent. The final product should be effective for contraception and ideally would also have a theoretically lower risk ofVTE especially for obese women. Although LNG has had the longest and widest history of providing effective contraception in a variety of formulations, newer progestins such as desogestrel and Nestorone may provide safe and effective contraception with improved bleeding patterns or other health benefits. Alternatively, non-hormonal contraceptive drugs may provide an opportunity to be able to be combined with anti-HIV drugs and provide dual purpose protection."
11175083,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty transposes the glenohumeral ball and socket, relieving pain and restoring
arm elevation. Yet many patients experience functional deficits in arm rotation, and up to 20% lose post-operative
range of motion. Our long-term objective is to optimize patient-specific outcomes via procedural, implant design,
and rehabilitation modifications by quantifying the biomechanical implications of the non-anatomic surgery. This
proposal focuses on arm rotation capabilities related to patient-specific humeral anatomic twist between the
shoulder and elbow (torsion) and the relative rotational orientation of the humeral implant (version). Humeral
torsion varies by 80° in the general population. Implant version is set generically at 0-40° relative to the forearm,
rarely referencing humeral anatomy. There is no consensus on optimal implant version, but retrospective clinical
data suggests matching implant version to torsion may improve post-surgical outcomes. Differences between
torsion and implant version are unknown during surgery, and this uncontrolled relationship may directly affect
rotator cuff and deltoid muscle efficacy. We will quantify the impact of torsion and implant version on shoulder
function in parallel studies of clinical outcomes and laboratory biomechanics. In Aim 1, data on 3D shoulder
anatomy, range of motion, and patient reported outcomes will be collected in patients pre-operative to reverse
shoulder arthroplasty using standard clinical assessments and imaging. Ultrasound will be used to determine its
utility as a pre-operative planning tool to quantify humeral torsion specific to reverse shoulder arthroplasty.
Surgeons will then perform the procedure per current standard of care without knowledge of patient-specific
study metrics. After one year, patients will return for their standard clinical follow up and clinical metrics will again
be assessed. A sub-cohort will then be recruited for additional data collection using dynamic stereoradiography,
where 3D humerothoracic, scapulothoracic, and glenohumeral motion are quantified during functional activities.
Humeral torsion will be analyzed with respect to implant version to determine how their relationships influence
shoulder function and clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, cadaver shoulders will be used to again test the relationship
between torsion and implant version, now adjusting implant version within each cadaver to quantify the discrete
influence of implant version relative to torsion. Biomechanical metrics including passive and active range of
motion, muscle force, joint reaction force, muscle length, and muscle moment arms will be captured on a
biorobotic simulator and in computational models. These metrics will be analyzed to measure the relative effect
size of torsion and implant version and determine if matching implant version to torsion improves shoulder
function. Successful completion of both Aims will allow biomechanical factors measured in Aim 2 to be analyzed
with respect to patient outcomes in Aim 1 to determine the origins of patient-specific functional deficiency.
Ultimately, this research challenges the standard of care in reverse shoulder arthroplasty, with the objective to
restore shoulder function in patients and set realistic and reliable expectations for the surgery."
11172693,"ABSTRACT
Less than a third of women diagnosed with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) survive five years after
diagnosis. Despite therapeutic improvements over time, patient survival has remained relatively unchanged for
decades. At present, we are unable to predict which EOC patients are at-risk for adverse outcomes following
first-line treatment. Thus, there remains a critical unmet need to identify innovative biomarkers for clinical
decision support that will achieve optimal outcomes in this deadly disease. As part of standard of care (SOC) for
EOC, computed tomography (CT) is used for diagnosis, prior to initiation of treatment, and to monitor treatment
response and patient outcomes. SOC CT images can be converted into quantitative data that can be used as
rapid, reproducible, and accurate non-invasive biomarkers for clinical decision support in the cancer care
continuum. The present proposal will utilize an extensively validated radiomics imaging pipeline developed by
our group and standard medical imaging software to measure body composition to identify image-based
biomarkers that predict survival among patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). We will
focus on HGSOC as it is the most common histotype of EOC and typically responds favorably to first-line
chemotherapy but >80% of patients experience recurrence. In Aim 1, we will build upon ongoing efforts to
establish a multi-institutional cohort of racially and ethnically diverse women with HGSOC with pre-treatment
SOC CT images and well-annotated clinical and outcomes data. Using validated radiomic pipelines developed
by our team, regions of interest (i.e., the primary ovarian tumor) from pre-treatment CT scans will be identified
and segmented, and image features will be calculated including radiomics and body composition depots (skeletal
muscle mass and subcutaneous, visceral, intra/intermuscular, and total adipose tissue). This multi-institutional
cohort will be utilized to identify and validate CT image-based features that predict survival among HGSOC
patients (Aim 2). We will further test the predictive model from Aim 2 and develop de novo models among
clinically relevant sub-groups of women with HGSOC, including racial and ethnic groups and women treated with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy vs. upfront surgical debulking as first-line therapy (Aim 3). This work will provide
readily calculable, non-invasive biomarkers from SOC CT images for clinically translational information to better
predict which patients may fail first-line therapy and to support patient therapy stratification. Ultimately, with
sufficient testing and validation, our long-term goal is to validate clinical-imaging models that could be
incorporated into clinical care to improve outcomes among HGSOC patients."
11172694,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer in adults in which most cases
develop in patients with liver cirrhosis. The incidence and mortality of HCC is rising and showing widening
disparities, with the Latinx population having the greatest increase over the last decade. Latinxs represent 19%
of the total U.S. population, comprise the largest racial/ethnic group in California (CA, 40%), and are notably
underrepresented in current research into biomarkers for HCC. Notably, HCC in U.S. born Latinxs from Mexico
is double that of Mexican-born individuals, underscoring the importance of social, behavioral, and
environmental risk factors on hepatocarcinogenesis. In our preliminary research using the Microbiome,
Microbial Markers, and Liver Disease (M3LD) Study, a multicenter prospective cohort of individuals with liver
cirrhosis recruited across CA, we published the first-in-human evidence showing a role for the gut-liver axis in
HCC risk. We identified a duodenal microbe (Alloprevotella), circulating metabolites (methionine and
methionine sulfoxide), and bile acid (taurocholic acid) that were associated with subsequent diagnosis of HCC.
We found a Latinx ethnicity-specific microbiome composition in participants with cirrhosis, and we showed that
dietary factors previously associated with reduced HCC risk (healthy eating index, coffee, fiber, and protein)
were associated with Latinx ethnicity and significant microbial differences in participants with cirrhosis at risk of
HCC. Based on these preliminary results, this study proposes to expand the M3LD cohort by enrolling ~1000
participants with liver cirrhosis enriching for the Latinx population, who will be followed prospectively for HCC
development. We will collect duodenal biopsy and blood specimens, clinical data, and epidemiological data.
We will characterize the duodenal barrier and identify novel bacteria and glycans, and probe for microbial-
related serum immune markers and metabolites. The overall goal is to apply a rigorous experimental design
that will reveal mechanisms that influence HCC risk in the Latinx population, ultimately leading to the
identification of novel biomarkers for risk assessment and targets for HCC prevention, and a disparity
reduction."
11172976,"The overall goal of our proposal is to place patients impacted by Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Related Dementia
(AD/ADRD), rather than the disease, at the center of the research in order to better tailor risk prediction, enable
individualized prevention, and improve clinical outcomes and management of these patients in their layered
complexity. Our point of departure is the recognition that chronic diseases, including AD/ADRD, do not exist
solely as isolated entities. Instead, we acknowledge that their shared organic substratum and common sets of
risk and protective factors contribute to determining concomitant trajectories of multiple diseases, mutually
influencing each other’s course and natural history, in ways yet unexplored. The use of large longitudinal datasets
such as electronic health records (EHRs) thus becomes a key novel asset with potential to advance
understanding and management of dynamic personalized risk in the layered complexity
involving variations
through risk factors, and concomitant diseases. Thus, we propose to federate a multiethnic 3-city EHR
consortium (New York Presbyterian’s: 6 million patients (33,000 with AD/ADRD;23% Hispanic); University of
Chicago: 2 million patients (11,000 with AD/ADRD; 60% Black); and University of Miami:1.4 million patients
(13,000 with AD/ADRD; 50% Hispanic). Further, mindful that EHRs often overlook social variables (e.g.,
race/ethnicity, education, income), known to alter dementia risk, we will embed these EHRs in census-track level
social determinants of health data to pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1 –Determine and quantify whether
and how: trajectories of multimorbidity (timing, order of incidence, level of control/management, evolution) predict
the incidence, timing, and progression of AD/ADRD, over years of longitudinal EHRs; and whether the
relationships between those trajectories and AD/ADRD are modified by gender, race/ethnicity, age, education,
place of birth, and other socioeconomic factors (1.a); and changes in specific multimorbidity risk factors (smoking,
weight) and manageable aspects of care (blood pressure control, glycemic control) impact the incidence, timing,
and progression of AD/ADRD (1.b). Aim 2 –Determine and quantify whether and how complexity patterns of
multimorbidity, complexity of care management, and patient complexity predict (2.a) and impact (2.b) the
incidence, timing, and progression of AD/ADRD over years of longitudinal EHRs, and whether those factors are
affected by gender, race/ethnicity, age, education, place of birth, and other socioeconomic factors. Aim 3 –
Determine the supplementary value of “enriched” EHR with research items already collected for participants
concomitantly enrolled in research cohorts, to refining identified trajectories and complexity patterns. We have
assembled an interdisciplinary complementary network of innovative researchers and will use machine learning
and novel dynamic predictive and causal inference methods to identify accelerators or decelerators of AD/ADRD.
This work will inform strategies to tailor risk prediction, and complex clinical management. It will also build a
multiethnic harmonized dynamic platform ready for real-world evaluation of future treatments of AD/ADRD."

Scholars to address the nation’s scientific needs in clinical pain research. UP3RK is situated at the University 
of Utah (UU), a rich environment to train interdisciplinary Scholars on clinical pain research in diverse settings. 
UP3RK training focuses on our institutional strengths of: 1) nonpharmacologic pain treatment; 2) effective 
interventions for pain and co-morbidities, particularly substance use disorders; 3) implementation science, and 
4) research with diverse and underserved populations. Annually, UP3RK supports five Scholars—within a twoyear training duration—through dedicated UP3RK Mentors within an innovative, multi-level mentor model 
(Mentor Matrix Model) that has proven extremely successful in developing independently-funded investigators 
who remain in academic research careers. The UP3RK trains our Scholars in: 1) in our four focus areas, 2) 
career development and programmatic skills, and 3) interdisciplinary research skills. UP3RK’s emphasis on 
communication, grant writing, and team science at all levels equip our Scholars with key knowledge, skills, and 
abilities to advance innovations to improve health for persons with chronic pain and enable a transdisciplinary 
approach to team science. To accomplish our mission, we leverage new and existing local training curricula 
and national trainings available from the HEAL PAIN Cohort Program. We evaluate UP3RK training activities 
through a dedicated evaluation process. UP3RK program objectives are: Objective 1: Recruit and support a 
diverse and interdisciplinary group of clinical pain research Scholars with particular emphasis to attract 
scholars underrepresented in medicine and clinical research, and those with diverse career paths and clinical 
backgrounds. Objective 2: Provide a state-of-the-art training environment and curriculum to develop the next 
generation of clinical pain researchers with emphasis on the UP3RK focus areas; nonpharmacological pain 
treatments; effective interventions for pain and co-morbidities, particularly SUDs; implementation science; and 
research within vulnerable, diverse, and underserved populations. Objective 3: Provide Scholars with 
opportunities to improve the impact of their clinical pain research careers and achieve independent research 
support within 5 years of completing the UP3RK program by developing career development and 
programmatic skills (e.g., technical, operational, professionalism, communication skills) and interdisciplinary

 grant renewal builds logically on the results generated during the first funding cycle showing that
(EPO)has immunomodulating activity in murine and human cells. We showed that EPO promotes
conversion of naïve T cells into regulatory T cells (Treg) in mice and humans, leading to prolonged graft survival
and reduced severity of multiple autoimmune disease models in mice. Our new preliminary data indicate that
EPO has also inhibitory effects on macrophage training and hinders the proinflammatory program of previously
trained cells. This effect, that occurs through a direct interaction with the EPO receptor on myeloid cells, leads
to prolonged graft survival in mice that underwent training. The present proposal will address the mechanisms
responsible for these effects using in vivo and in vitro systems. We will also test the role of endogenous EPO on
trained immunity.
The results of this research project will provide new insight on the role of macrophage training in alloimmune
responses and how EPO counteracts them. The data have the potential to unravel cellular and molecular
pathways that are important in the pathophysiology of rejection and to identify new therapeutic targets. The fact
that EPO is FDA-approved, makes our findings easier to be translated into the clinic."

Current therapeutic interventions for treating neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD),
frontotemporal dementia (FTD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), are highly
limited in both number and efficacy, suggesting novel approaches are needed. Historically, most research
effort has focused on developing strategies for treating each of these diseases individually, but these
endeavors have largely failed in advancing efficacious therapeutics for these debilitating diseases. We have
recently generated exciting, unpublished data that offers the promise to overcome this gap in
neurodegenerative research. We have found that genetic deletion of one of the members of the membrane
spanning 4a (Ms4a) family of genes, Ms4a6c, significantly improves cognitive, behavioral, and cellular
phenotypes in mouse models of AD, FTD, ALS, and MS. Moreover, we and others have demonstrated that
polymorphisms in Ms4a genes are strongly and reproducibly linked to altered susceptibility to
neurodegenerative disorders, including ALS and AD. The genetic link between Ms4a genes and
neurodegeneration has been best studied in AD, where current data suggest that as many as 10% of all AD
cases worldwide may be explained by polymorphism in Ms4a genes. Together, this research suggests that
therapeutic strategies targeting Ms4a genes are likely to be beneficial in treating many neurodegenerative
disorders. However, to date we have only examined in detail the effect of deleting a single Ms4a family
member on neurodegeneration. Although Ms4a6c deletion results in significant improvement in all phenotypes
that we have examined across multiple neurodegenerative disorders, the phenotypic rescue remains
incomplete and there is still some evidence of disease in Ms4a6c knockout mice. The Ms4a gene family
consists of 17 members, and in addition to Ms4a6c, other Ms4a family members, including Ms4a4a, Ms4a4e,
and Ms4a6e have also been strongly genetically linked to altered risk of developing neurodegenerative
disorders. In addition, we have found that similarly to Ms4a6c, the expression of many Ms4a genes is
upregulated in multiple mouse models of neurodegeneration. Together, these observations suggest that
deletion of other Ms4a family members might also improve neurodegenerative phenotypes, and we have
generated significant pilot data in support of this hypothesis. Our first aim will therefore take advantage of novel
mouse genetic reagents we have generated to enable us to probe the effect of deleting other Ms4a family
members individually or deleting multiple Ms4a family members simultaneously on neurodegenerative
phenotypes. In our second aim, we will build on considerable pilot data to elucidate the mechanisms by which
Ms4a genes regulate neurodegeneration, a process which to date remains entirely unexplored. Together,
these aims will provide significant insight into the role that Ms4a genes play across neurodegenerative
diseases and take us one significant step closer to developing therapeutic approaches targeting these genes."
11116095,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT 
We feel that the Department of Anesthesiology and the Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center (CPFRC) 
at the University of Michigan (UM) would be ideally positioned to be a part of the HEAL PAIN Cohort Program. 
We already have established inter-disciplinary partnerships with investigative teams at UM and beyond who 
work in nearly all of the disciplines listed in the FOA including engineering, social sciences, epidemiology, 
biostatistics, computer sciences, bioengineering, addiction medicine, public health, and or mental 
health/behavioral health. Our core CPFRC faculty share this inter-disciplinary diversity. Amongst our 11 core 
faculty we only have one physician; we have three pain psychologists, two neuroscientists, a 
psychoneuroimmunologist, a social scientist, an epidemiologist, an environmental health scientist turned 
cannabis and psychedelic researcher, and a social worker turned neuroscientist (Baker). However we do not 
currently have a post-doctoral training grant specifically designed to support and train the next generation of 
inter-disciplinary post-doctoral clinical pain researchers. 
Our proposed University of Michigan (UM) HEAL Initiative® Partnership to Advance INterdisciplinary (PAIN) 
Training in Clinical Pain Research (the UM HEAL PAIN Cohort T90/R90) will support interdisciplinary 
postdoctoral training to promote the next generation of independent clinical pain researchers. We feel that the 
proposed UM HEAL PAIN Cohort Program can provide exemplary training in six of ten HEAL content areas, 
including: chronic overlapping pain conditions; effective interventions for pain and co-morbidities; non-opioid 
pharmacological treatments for pain; nonpharmacological interventions for pain; pain across the lifespan; 
prevention of the transition from acute to chronic pain; and bioinformatics. We also feel that our program 
mentors can provide clinical pain research training in several fields that have not historically been well 
represented in pain research including engineering; social sciences; epidemiology; biostatistics; computer 
sciences; addiction medicine; public health; and mental health/behavioral health. 
Although we have identified and named five mentors who are established pain researchers and five others in 
the under-represented fields, UM has a vast number of established pain researchers and mentors at various 
points in their career that are not accustomed to receiving effort to mentor. Those non-named UM faculty will 
augment the mentors named in the grant, to enable us to assign each trainee both a junior and senior mentor, 
since we feel they often bring different perspectives. We also are using departmental support of the CPFRC 
Health Equity Core and its many patient partners with lived experience. We will also assign each trainee a 
person with lived experience to be part of their mentoring team. The curriculum and evaluation programs for 
this program are built upon several very successful T32 and K-12 program, including our HEAL Pain K-12."
11134921,"ABSTRACT 
Pain and substance use disorders (SUD) represent arguably the two most prevalent and costly public health 
condition in the United States. While vitally important to consider, the intersection of pain and SUD is not just 
limited to opioid use/abuse. Patients being treated for SUD (opioid and non-opioid) commonly report chronic 
pain, and, in turn, a history of SUD occurs frequently among patients who receive treatment for chronic pain. 
Despite the enormous need for new safe and efficacious treatments, the intersection of pain and SUD research 
remains a surprisingly underexplored area of inquiry, which has resulted in excessive knowledge gaps and 
limited pain treatment options for people with or in recovery from a SUD. To address this unmet need, we have 
developed a new postdoctoral training program: the Promoting Excellence through Pain and Addiction Research 
Enhancement (PREPARE) T90/R90 Training Program. A defining feature of the PREPARE Program will be an 
emphasis on social determinants of health (SDOH) as they relate to chronic pain and SUD clinical research. 
SDOH define the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age, and the inequities in power, 
money, and resources that are often responsible for disparities in pain and SUD outcomes across the U.S. Our 
overall goal is to develop outstanding independent investigators capable of sustaining productive clinical and 
translational research careers addressing the biopsychosocial (emphasis on social) mechanisms underlying 
chronic pain and SUD development, and/or designing clinical interventions to relieve pain and ameliorate SUD. 
To facilitate progress toward this goal, the PREPARE Program will complete the following. 1. Recruit and train 
promising early career investigators (postdoctoral fellows) to conduct mechanistically-based clinical research in 
pain and SUD. 2. Implement an integrated training program that will equip trainees with new research skills and 
the knowledge to apply these skills to important and unanswered questions regarding pain and SUD. 3. Create 
a culture of responsible research conduct and professional excellence to ensure trainees aspire to high 
standards of scientific integrity and quality. PREPARE will leverage an excellent infrastructure and collaborative 
network at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. We anticipate significant success in 
recruiting and training an outstanding and diverse group of trainees during the initial funding cycle. Members of 
the training faculty boast excellent track records of research funding and mentoring experience. Prepare requests 
support for five postdoctoral trainees (4 T90, 1 R90) from a variety of clinical training backgrounds, each of whom 
will work with their multidisciplinary mentoring team to create and implement a tailored independent development 
plan as the blueprint for their training. Trainees will achieve their research and career development objectives 
through a combination of didactic, research, and professional development activities, and program evaluation 
will be ongoing and multimodal. The PREPARE Program is committed to promoting diversity among our trainees, 
and the program will provide a training experience that emphasizes excellence in research integrity and ethics."
10989491,"Project Summary:
The vast majority (90%) of cancers are epithelial in nature, and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) accounts 
for a portion of these cases by afflicting 744,884 people yearly, worldwide. Late-stage cancer diagnosis is 
associated with low survival rates, whereas individuals diagnosed at an early stage have a significantly better 
chance of survival. Current standard screening examinations often fail to identify abnormal regions with high risk 
of malignancy, and, thus, need to be improved to increase survival rate. Dr. Gracie Vargas, my sponsor, has 
developed a detection approach that combines multiple optical imaging modalities to visualize large areas 
(widefield, WF) with complementary microscopic areas (nonlinear optical microscopy, NLOM) for label-free 
identification of neoplasia. This approach has demonstrated substantial image-based alterations in high-risk 
lesions using the system in preclinical animal models. As with many novel optical systems, our research shows 
there is room for optimization in this promising technique. The handling and evaluating of the complex data and 
identifying the most important features associated with early cancer changes is an additional challenge,
particularly in the application in human specimens. Here, I propose an approach that combines label-free 
multimodal optical imaging with artificial intelligence (AI) to develop data-driven diagnostics for detection of early 
high-risk lesions with potential for malignant, to ultimately increase survival rate. In the F99 phase, I will optimize 
and evaluate a WF system by integrating a seamless spectral capability, to capture a wide range of spectral 
features in human OSCC samples. This optimization will acquire additional image-based information that applied 
to machine learning methods to extract the most important features associated with early cancer changes, while 
potentially improving the systems performance. My dissertation work during the F99 phase will equip me with 
training and expertise in the integration of biomedical optics, under the guidance of Dr. Gracie Vargas at the 
University of Texas medical Branch at Galveston, and machine learning, with support from my co-sponsor, Dr. 
Heidi Spratt, to advance translational early cancer detection. In the postdoctoral K00 phase, I will concentrate 
on developing multimodal label-free optical approaches for data-driven early cancer diagnostics. This research
involves complex decision-making that can extend beyond the capabilities of traditional machine learning. Thus, 
as I transition to the post-doctoral phase, I will train in advanced AI methods, such as deep learning, as well as 
explore the integration of patient records to enhance early cancer diagnostics. The successful completion of this 
project will advance emerging noninvasive early cancer multimodal microscopy technologies through cutting 
edge data-driven approaches, ultimately enhancing early epithelial cancer detection and diagnostics."
10655892,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
The assembly and release of HIV-1 from infected cells are essential steps in the viral replication cycle.
HIV assembly is driven by the virally encoded Gag polyprotein. Bending of the plasma membrane into
spherical buds, packing of the RNA genome (gRNA), and incorporation of the envelope glycoprotein (Env)
are among the key events of assembly and budding. Release depends on the the host-encoded ESCRT
proteins, which are recruited by Gag to the neck. Building on considerable progress in understanding
structural and cellular mechanisms of HIV assembly, we are now in a position to answer the major open
questions about how HIV-1 orchestrates its own release by hijacking ESCRT complexes. This process is
especially timely in the wake of the discovery of the endogenous retroCHMP3 factor that restricts
ESCRT-mediated release of retroviruses and other enveloped viruses in some new world monkeys,
without unduly compromising host ESCRT functions needed for normal cell function. We will take a
three-pronged approach to explaining how HIV-1 assembly and release are coupled through the ESCRT
system. In the first aim, structural studies of biochemically tractable subassemblies of ESCRTs from
humans and other species will be used to build up experimentally validated models of those aspects of
the system that are still missing. These include the linkages downstream of ESCRT-1. Single particle
cryo-EM structures will be determined and integrated models will be build in collaboration with Greg Voth.
In the second aim, the entire system consisting of HIV-1 Gag, membranes, and human ESCRTs will be
reconstituted in vitro. Scission function will be assessed biophysically using membrane nanotubes pulled
by optical tweezers. Structures of the entire reconstituted system will be determined by cryo-electron
tomography (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging {STA), with modeling guided by atomistic structures,
either pre-existing or obtained in the first aim. In the third aim, a structural movie of release will be
obtained by stepwise in situ cryo-ET imaging of HIV-1 as it escapes infected cells. ESCRT-mediated
HIV-1 release will be trapped at various stages through the use of targeted inhibition of each step in the
assembly. We will begin with targeted inhibition of the AAA+ ATPase responsible for the final stage
release, VPS4A/B. RetroCHMP3 and other targeted dominant negative factors will be used to inhibit
earlier steps in the pathway. Cryo-ET imaging will be carried out for budding events at the cell periphery,"
10886200,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV-1 viremia but does not cure HIV-1 infection. Inability to cure is attributed 
to HIV-1 proviruses in long-lived memory CD4+ T cells, most of which are transcriptionally silent and resistant to 
extirpation. Better understanding of the factors that regulate provirus transcription could offer new strategies for 
effective cure of HIV-1 infection. This grant proposal stems from our observation that vpx/vpr from across primate 
immunodeficiency virus phylogeny increase provirus transcription by degrading the Human Silencing Hub (HUSH) 
complex. The immediate goals are to better understand host and viral determinants of HUSH-mediated transcriptional 
silencing of the provirus. Aim 1 will be to use unbiased, genome-wide, HUSH loss-of-function screens to identify host 
factors required in trans for HUSH-mediated silencing. We will also identify cellular proteins near HUSH-silenced 
proviruses using a dCas9–APEX2 fusion protein (C-BERST) that is targeted to proviruses with sgRNAs. Functional 
relevance of hits will be confirmed and mechanistic hypotheses about how these factors contribute to provirus 
silencing will be tested. We will assess the contribution of our hits to HIV-1 latency by quantitating cell-associated HIV1 RNA after candidate gene disruption in stimulated CD4+ T cells from people living with HIV-1 on ART. Aim 2 will be 
to characterize cis-acting requirements for detection and silencing by HUSH. Promoters and transcripts from HUSH 
targeted proviruses and transgenes will be engineered to finely map and characterize the determinants of HUSH 
sensitivity. HIV-1 sequences cloned from people living with HIV-1 will be tested to determine if HUSH exerts selective 
pressure on the virus during establishment of HIV-1 latency in vivo. If HIV-1 infection is to be treated by perturbing 
HUSH, the consequences of these interventions on CD4+ T cell function and development need to be better 
understood. In Aim 3, the effect of HUSH on the chromatin landscape in 1° CD4+ T cells will be assessed using RNASeq, ATAC-Seq, and CUT&Tag for multiple chromatin features. HUSH-sensitive genes identified here, which include 
endogenous retroviruses, will be used iteratively as reporters for screens in Aim 1. HUSH components will be knocked 
out in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and these cells will be used to reconstitute a model immune 
system in which the effect of HUSH knockout on development and chromatin landscape of CD4+ T cells will be 
assessed. Finally, the effect of HUSH knockout on HIV-1 replication and establishment of latency will be assessed 
within this experimental model of HIV-1 infection."
10805651,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
A central goal in HIV/AIDS vaccine research is the elicitation of broadly neutralizing antibodies 
(bNAbs). Here, we leverage three recent discoveries from our groups to generate more effective V2 apex 
immunogens. Having found that unshielded regions (“glycan holes”) in Env are negatively associated with 
bNAb development, we have created bioinformatic tools to identify and mask these unwanted epitopes. We 
have also used our Signature-based Epitope Targeted (SET) immunogen design strategy to generate 
germline targeting Envs that engage multiple V2 apex bNAb precursors. Finally, by studying bNAb 
development in ~150 rhesus macaques (RMs) infected with 16 different SHIVs, we have identified 25 animals 
(17%) with heterologous breadth, 15 of which developed V2 apex bNAbs. Based on these data, we 
hypothesize that by (i) minimizing distracting glycan hole epitopes, (ii) increasing Env affinity for V2 apex 
bNAb precursors, (iii) increasing relevant epitope diversity in vaccine boosts, and (iv) incorporating B cell 
lineage designs, we will improve V2 bNAb germline engagement and bNAb lineage maturation. During the 
first 3 years of this R37 application, we have made significant progress toward all Specific Aims. In 
Aim 1, we optimized the glycan shield and improved the germline targeting properties of several SIVcpz and 
HIV-1 Envs, which allowed us to down-select the CAP256 Env as the most promising platform. In Aim 2, we 
cloned members of 12 new rhesus V2 apex bNAb lineages and inferred their unmutated common ancestors 
(UCAs), thereby tripling the number of V2 bNAb lineages for novel lineage-based immunogen design. SHIVs 
expressing the best performing germline targeting CAP256 Envs are being generated and envelope-antibody 
coevolution pathways are being determined for all SHIV infected animals that developed V2 neutralization 
breadth. In Aim 3, we generated nucleoside-modified mRNA containing lipid nanoparticle (mRNA/LNP) 
vaccines that express germline targeting, stabilized, membrane bound CAP256 Envs. The best performing 
constructs have been shown to express well and to bind multiple human and macaque V2 bNAb UCAs. In 
this five-year MERIT extension application, we propose to extend these studies and complete the rhesus 
macaque infection and immunization studies that were delayed by the COVID lockdown. Since the last 
competitive renewal, our group has been highly productive, publishing 38 papers relevant to HIV vaccine 
development. In this MERIT extension application, we will apply multiple vaccine improvement strategies to 
induce V2 apex bNAbs in RMs and then translate these findings to humans."

In response to RFA-NS-24-015, we propose the University of Florida Partnerships Across Interdisciplinary
Networks: Training through Engineering, epidemiology & Addiction Medicine (UF PAIN TEAM) - a T90/R90
interdisciplinary postdoctoral program designed to train the next generation of independent clinical pain
researchers. Our UF PAIN TEAM training program is built on the unique strengths of our existing CTSl-developed
team training model, adding a pain science emphasis to clinical pain research training and integrating traditional
and non-traditional areas of pain research. We will also emphasize collaboration across the research continuum,
and further expand the scope of interdisciplinary clinical pain research to include disciplines not traditionally
represented in pain research. We will create a unique cohort experience by embedding authentic, collaborative
and interdisciplinary experiences in team science into each trainee's research, preparing them to conduct team
science clinical pain research locally and across the broader HEAL PAIN Cohort Program. The proposed team
training approach for clinical pain research combines authentic didactic and experiential training in team
science; interdisciplinary mentoring that crosses academic barriers; scientific training across the entire
biopsychosocial model of pain; and career development mentoring that crosses academic disciplines. We will
provide extensive breadth and depth in training to i) 4 post-doctoral scientists (T90; PhD, Dual degree-PhD), and
ii) 1 non-citizen, non-permanent resident clinically-trained PhD holder (R90), that are seeking advanced postdoctoral
training in scientific areas designated as high priority by HEAL. These areas are pain across the lifespan,
nonpharmacological interventions for pain, non-opioid pharmacological treatments for pain, effective
interventions for pain and co-morbidities, impacts of social determinants of health on pain, and advancing health
equity in pain. To accomplish our goals, expert program faculty will provide extensive team training experiences.
Postdoctoral trainees will receive an initial commitment for appointments of two years, where 2 teams of trainees
will work together and develop their own collaborative projects involving disciplines traditionally and not
traditionally represented in clinical pain research. By implementing an integrated team training program, including
didactic, research, and professional development activities, we will equip trainees with new skills, knowledge,
and expertise to apply these skills in collaborative teams. We will also create a culture of responsible research
conduct and professional excellence to ensure that trainees aspire to the high standards of scientific integrity
and quality, which will set the tone for their future careers in clinical pain research. Finally, we will disseminate
elements of our team training model regionally and nationally via interdisciplinary communities of traditional and
non-traditional pain disciplines including the Annual HEAL PURPOSE Network. Collectively, these programs will
produce highly skilled, collaborative, and interactive scientists who can engage in team science to generate new
knowledge and translate discoveries to tangible advances in the prevention, treatment, and cure of chronic pain."

Loss of neural function is a common problem with aging and disease. To treat this loss, current
neural stimulators have used various forms of stimulation that putatively activate neurons to
elicit neuromodulation. Generally these stimulators rely on a fixed frequency and amplitude
stimulus. Recently, we have found that subperceptual levels of random electrical stimulation
applied to the vestibular system produce improvements in vestibular-mediated reflex function,
balance and gait demonstrating the use of low levels of electrical stimulation to enhance the
natural neural signaling of the vestibular system without exogenous stimulus. The goal of this
present work is to demonstrate the sustained improvement of balance and gait by applying low
levels of random electrical stimulation to the vestibular system of elderly individuals with
vestibular hypofunction. We hypothesize that elderly participants will display functional
improvement with sustained low levels of random electrical stimulation. This work will establish
parameters for viable treatment of age related vestibular loss in elderly individuals using safe
and effective amounts of electrical stimulation."

Coinfection with HIV significantly impacts the pathogenesis of HBV and HCV and is associated with reduced spontaneous clearance of HCV and HBsAg, higher rates of chronicity and occult HBV, higher HCV viral loads, rapid disease progression, and increased risk of morbidity and mortality due to cirrhosis and HCC. Integrated strategies for screening and diagnosis of HIV and viral hepatitis infections are therefore critical to an effective global health response.

 For this administrative supplement to our K12 BIRCWH grant, UC Davis is requesting support to allow
our fourth Scholar, Dr. Adrienne Hoyt-Austin whose background meets the NIH criteria for being from an
underrepresented minority group and disadvantaged background in interdisciplinary women’s health and sex
differences research. This proposed Scholar is within 6 years of a terminal degree and will engage in
interdisciplinary women’s health and/or sex/gender disparities, team science-based research and create an
independent development plan for her pathway to independence. Her research focus is to addressing health
disparities by improving evidence-based breastfeeding support to increase breastfeeding rates, exclusivity, and
duration, especially amongst racial and ethnic minorities. This research addresses two of the BIRCWH
crosscutting themes: 1) health disparities; and 2) interdisciplinary research.
 Over the past 21 years, the UC Davis BIRCWH program has trained a sizeable, diverse cadre of
interdisciplinary researchers in women’s health and sex differences and heightened the visibility and prominence
of this research. Led by Dr. Nancy Lane, we continue to build on this strong foundation to increase UC Davis
BIRCWH innovation and impact by fostering an academically stimulating and nurturing environment that
facilitates our objectives. Our short-term BIRCWH objectives are to: 1) provide in-depth, individualized training
and team-based interdisciplinary mentoring to support the independent career development of Scholars in
interdisciplinary women’s health and sex differences research; and 2) advance and achieve high-impact women’s
health and sex/gender differences research by establishing cross-disciplinary collaborations with the UC Davis
schools. Our long-term objectives are to: 1) improve women’s health by enhancing understanding of the unique
aspects of female sex and gender and then translating this knowledge to clinical practice; 2) develop
transformative interdisciplinary team science for women’s health and sex/gender disparities research; and 3)
train leaders in interdisciplinary women’s health and sex differences research.
 To accomplish the objectives for this supplement, our proposed BIRCWH Scholar will continue to
participate in: 1) team-based, interdisciplinary mentored research and career development activities; 2) core
courses on grant writing, biostatistics, team science and responsible conduct of research; 3) supplemental
courses tailored to her needs and interests; 4) integrated journal clubs; 5) monthly meetings with the PI and RDs
to discuss research and career progress; 6) an annual symposium of Northern California BIRCWH programs;
and 7) the School of Medicine Mentoring Academy to optimize mentoring experiences. To support this scholar,
our BIRCWH program will continue to leverage campus expertise in the topical areas of her research."

11172071,"Project Summary:
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has emerged as the greatest unmet medical need in
cardiovascular medicine, comprising 50% of all HF cases, with a US prevalence of ³3 million. HFpEF is
associated with high morbidity and mortality, with a 5-year survival after hospitalization worse than most cancers
of ~35% and, unlike the better understood heart failure with reduced ejected fraction (HFrEF), there are no
evidence-based therapies for HFpEF. HFpEF represents an entirely new disease threat because of the systemic
metabolic and endocrine nature of its pathogenesis. And, while HFpEF is heterogeneous in its clinical
presentation, arguably the most prevalent form is cardiometabolic HFpEF (cMet HFpEF), where the main
comorbidities are obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. These same comorbidities are the major drivers of
concomitant obesity-related diseases that includes nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is prevalent
in more than 50% of HFpEF patients and has been demonstrated to be an independent predictor of all-cause
mortality in HFpEF. This is of unique concern as the obesity epidemic continues to grow with current estimations
that 45% of the world’s population is either overweight or obese. Our preliminary data support the notion that the
heart is a primary regulator of global metabolic syndrome through the serine-threonine kinase, serum
glucocorticoid kinase 1 (SGK1). Global SGK1 overexpression has been demonstrated to promote increased
obesity, dyslipidemia, while liver-specific deletion of SGK1 has been shown to protect against NAFLD. While
there is a clear connection between SGK1 and obesity-related metabolic syndrome, neither a role for SGK1 in
cMet HFpEF nor the mechanism by which SGK1 regulates cellular metabolism have been investigated. In this
proposal, we will focus on cardiac-specific SGK1 in cMet HFpEF with the hypothesis that SGK1 promotes cardiac
pathology and subsequent global metabolic dysfunction in cMet HFpEF via regulating mTORC1 activity and
cardiac metabolism. We will address this hypothesis using cardiac-specific targeting of SGK1 in a mouse model
of cMet HFpEF with a focus on assessments of cardiac function and metabolism, as well as mechanistic studies
in primary cardiomyocytes, in the following Specific Aims which are to: (Aim 1) determine the role for cardiac
SGK1 in regulating heart function, metabolism, and heart directed inter-organ communication during cMet
HFpEF, (Aim 2) determine whether PRAS40 inhibition by SGK1 promotes mTORC1 mediated pathologic cardiac
metabolic inflexibility during cMet HFpEF, and (Aim 3) evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a novel SGK1 inhibitory
peptide for preserving cardiac function and systemic metabolism during cMet HFpEF. These studies are
significant as the present the opportunity to identify novel secreted factors from the heart that regulate global
metabolic health as well as to test new therapeutic targets for both HFpEF and obesity-related diseases."

Duke University and North Carolina Central University (NCCU), a historically Black institution, are applying for
additional support for Dr. Tarannum Jaleel, appointed Sept. 2022 and Dr. Binita Chakraborty (postdoc),
appointed Sept. 2023. The Duke/NCCU BIRCWH is a strong, vibrant program that has the leadership and
institutional commitment required for continued success. Our partnership, now in its 24th year, provides the
foundation for a program that encompasses interdisciplinary research, structured mentoring, and individualized
career development for junior faculty, with three major goals: (1) Develop highly skilled, innovative researchers
who use interdisciplinary approaches to investigate women’s health and sex/gender influences across the
lifespan; (2) Foster diversity in women’s health research and advance health disparities research affecting
women’s health by identifying and recruiting scholars from diverse backgrounds and (3) Enable and equip
BIRCWH scholars to lead interdisciplinary teams of scientists, and to become the mentors and leaders of the
future. Drawing on the breadth of expertise at our two universities, we have the capacity to advance the career
development of scholars interested in basic, clinical, or health services research across a broad range of fields.
Our scholars learn to integrate approaches to focus on women’s health and sex/gender differences in human
disease. Scholars’ interdisciplinary mentoring teams include a mentor from our core group of nationally known
senior investigators from Duke and NCCU, with others added to maximize interdisciplinary expertise and
collaborations. Scholars perform intense, hands-on research; course work; and training in grant writing, health
disparities, team science, SABV and RCR. Scholar progress is monitored by the Leadership Team and the
Internal Advisory Committee (IAC). The program is assessed and advised by the IAC and an External Advisory
Committee. External evaluations of our program and scholars are performed by an independent evaluator in
the Duke Social Science Research Institute. The Duke/NCCU BIRCWH program is achieving its goal to
increase the size and influence of a diverse pool of highly trained women’s health researchers who are poised
to address the nation’s biomedical, behavioral, and clinical needs.
We request this administrative supplement to support these two scholars for one additional appointment period
each. This will enable them to complete their BIRCWH project-specific aims, publish their findings in peer-
reviewed journals, and apply for additional independent funding."
11174112,"This Supplement proposes to extend the ongoing support for two individuals through the end of the UIC
BIRCWH grant period. One individual is a Hispanic physician scientist who was appointed as a BIRCWH
Scholar in September 2022 through an administrative supplement. His program of research focuses on health
disparities in cervical cancer. The second is a Black scientist who was appointed as a BIRCWH postdoctoral
trainee in August 2023 through the second administrative supplement. Her program of research focuses on a
dietary lifestyle intervention developed with and for pregnant Black women to prevent gestational diabetes and
lower cardiometabolic risk. That postdoctoral trainee succeeded in securing a faculty position as a tenure-track
Assistant Professor in the UIC College of Pharmacy, and these additional funds would provide her the
opportunity to transition to a BIRCWH Scholar. Both individuals would continue their ongoing participation in
the UIC BIRCWH. The long-term goal of the UIC BIRCWH program is to promote training and career
development of a new generation of researchers equipped with the knowledge and career skills necessary to
advance science for the health of women in the next decade and beyond. We are based in the UIC College of
Medicine, but draw on the interdisciplinary strengths of UIC’s seven health colleges. With supplemental
funding, the 2019-2024 UIC BIRCWH has trained 8 researchers in women’s or sex/gender-based health
research: 4 clinician (MD) Scholars, 3 PhD Scholars, and 1 Postdoctoral trainee. With the requested continued
funding and her new faculty appointment, the postdoctoral fellow would transition to become a BIRCWH
Scholar. The UIC BIRCWH capitalizes on four program strengths: (1) our success in launching the careers of a
diverse cohort of 25 junior faculty and one postdoctoral fellow in women’s health research (35% Black or
Hispanic); (2) alignment with the goals of the NIH and Office for Research on Women’s Health; (3) the highly
interdisciplinary nature of the program and integration across UIC and regional BIRCWH Programs; and (4) the
use of evidence-based mentoring practices to prepare scholars to conduct team science and address barriers
facing new female and URM investigators. Our short-term objectives build upon these strengths through
ongoing program activities and several new initiatives. Ongoing activities include: a) supplementing team
mentoring programs with new training and tools, b) optimizing existing and new UIC partnerships, and c)
augmenting our strong didactic curriculum in women’s health research. BIRCWH activities at UIC related to
sex and gender influences in health and disease will advance the ORWH goal to accelerate the translation of
knowledge into improved health care for women."

progression to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease. Therefore, there is a dire need to identify
therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat AKI. The kidneys have a high metabolic rate and substantial
decreases in the levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and NAD+/NADH imbalance impairs
energy generation and kidney function during AKI. Augmentation of NAD+ may protect kidney tubule against
diverse stressors. However, how NAD+/NADH imbalance contributes to development of AKI remains unknown.
Our preliminary studies involving a druggable genome screen have discovered an unexpected role of a
transcriptional repressor CtBP2 (C-Terminal Binding Protein 2) in renal epithelial cell death. CtBP2 is a
NAD+/NADH-dependent transcriptional repressor. Our studies show that CtBP2 is activated in ischemic,
nephrotoxic, and rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI. Moreover, in multiple mouse models of AKI, pharmacological
inhibition of CtBP2 mitigated renal impairment, suggesting a pathogenic role. Furthermore, we found that
CtBP2 is acetylated and this is critical for nuclear localization during AKI. Our ChIP-seq (chromatin
immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) studies showed that CtBP2 transcriptionally suppresses many
genes involved in energy metabolism, including NAD+ biosynthesis in AKI. We hypothesize that CtBP2 is a
pathogenic regulator of RTEC dysfunction and cell death that regulates NAD+/NADH imbalance-mediated
metabolic dysregulation as a stress-induced metabolic sensor during AKI. To test this hypothesis, we will
investigate a role of p300 in nuclear localization and activation of CtBP2 in AKI (Aim 1) and determine a
pathogenic role of CtBP2 in renal injury and metabolic changes during AKI (Aim 2). These studies will
significantly advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of CtBP2 activation during AKI. These
outcomes will define novel molecular networks that underlie the severity of AKI and could lead to development
of CtBP2 inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy."

11176727,"Prepubertal childhood obesity (PPO) has emerged as an epidemic and major health problem in the United States. Recent studies suggest that PPO is associated with increased risk of renal injury in children. The consequences of PPO as an independent risk factor for renal disease in the absence of diabetes has received little attention. Recently, we observed our obese rat model (SSLepRmutant) develops insulin resistance (IR) and progressive proteinuria in the absence of diabetes during the prepubescent stage. In the current proposal, we will use the SSLepRmutant rat to explore several mechanisms that may contribute to the development of renal disease during PPO. Changes in tubular glucose and energy metabolism are now considered as major characteristics of renal disease. Under normal physiological conditions, fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is the main source of energy in renal proximal tubules (PTs), and insulin stimulates glucose transport and inhibits gluconeogenesis (glucose production) in the PT. However, IR is associated with increased glucose transport and decreased glucose output in cultured PT cells under hyperglycemic conditions, which could potentially lead to glucotoxicity, mitochondria dysfunction, and tubular injury. Moreover, clinical and animal studies have demonstrated that both gluconeogenesis and glycolysis (glucose breakdown) are elevated, while FAO is reduced during the later stages of diabetic renal disease. However, little is known about these pathways in the PT under IR, non-diabetic conditions in the early stages of renal injury. Our central hypothesis is that IR alters PT glucose transport and energy metabolism and promotes tubular injury. In Specific Aim 1, we propose to investigate whether IR in the PT triggers increased gluconeogenesis contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction early during non-diabetic PPO. In Specific Aim 2, our goal is to examine whether limiting PT glucose transport can improve energy metabolism and mitochondrial function of the PTs, thereby preventing renal hyperfiltration and reducing inflammation and progressive proteinuria during non-diabetic PPO. Furthermore, these aims also will employ state-of-the art mass spectrometry proteomics to identify molecular mechanisms in isolated PTs from both, SS and SSLepRmutant rats. Overall, results from these studies will identify molecular mechanisms that play a crucial role of IR in the early progression of renal disease during PPO which increases risk of CKD in adulthood."
11174189,"Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease caused by uromodulin mutations (ADTKD-UMOD) is one of the most common hereditary kidney diseases. It represents as many as 25% of patients with inherited kidney disease, after exclusion of polycystic kidney disease and Alport syndrome. ADTKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis, and currently there is no treatment. 
To develop targeted therapies, by using CRISPR/Cas9, we have generated the first ADTKD-UMOD mouse model harboring a leading human UMOD deletion mutation. UMOD is largely synthesized and secreted by tubular cells of thick ascending limb (TAL). Our mouse model shows that autophagy deficiency in TALs leads to increased accumulation of mutant UMOD protein-the root cause of the disease, eventually causing TAL cell death and renal fibrosis in ADTKD. 
The goal of this R56 award is to delineate the molecular mechanism regulating autophagy in ADTKD. The proposed study will pave the way to develop new therapeutic strategies for ADTKD patients."

This SeroNet Center of Excellence in SARS-CoV2 basic and applied research will use human clinical samples and small
animal models to illuminate the molecular mechanisms driving serological and humoral immune responses to this
pandemic pathogen. Here we outline Project 2, which will investigate the influence of polyclonal antibodies present in
convalescent plasma on the virologic and immunobiological outcomes, and immune responses in patients treated with
convalescent plasma for severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, the agent of Covid-19. This project leverages the robust
infrastructure for collection and infusion of CCP as therapy at our institution. Serum and mucosal samples collected from
CCP donors and CCP recipients provide a comprehensive and longitudinal biorepository to examine the fundamental
immunobiological properties of antibodies in CCP. Samples are provided by participants enrolled in an integrated but
separately funded, investigator-initiated trial of convalescent plasma therapy at our institution. Project 2, Aim 1 will
provide an in-depth analysis that addresses whether neutralizing and/or non-neutralizing antibodies in CCP accelerate
viral clearance and resolve inflammation in blood and mucosal compartments. CCP containing different concentrations
of neutralizing antibodies will also be tested in a novel translational model of SARS-CoV-2 mouse challenge with Project
1. In Project 2 Aim 2, we will employ novel recombinant antigen development technologies and systems serology (Core
B) and Ig seq (Core C) to define the isotype-specific properties of antibodies in donor CCP units, and measure the
trafficking of these antibodies in CCP recipients. Project 2 Aim 3 will longitudinally follow CCP recipients to evaluate the
influence of CCP therapy on de novo development of long lived plasma blasts and memory B cells. This project
contributes critically to Project 1 in the serocenter by the provision of a robust clinical-immunobiological repository of
CCP donors and recipients. Interactions with Project 3 allow for comparisons between these cohorts and other
observational cohorts of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who did not receive CCP. Facilitated by Core A, Cores B
and C provide innovative assays necessary to address long-standing questions regarding differential antiviral and
immunomodulatory properties of specific antibodies in convalescent plasma. The virological and immunobiological data
generated in this proposal can be linked to a granular database of individual demographics and clinical variables in
patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The integration of this Project within the serocenter, and the potential to link
biological observations to clinical outcomes in our parallel, randomized therapeutic study in which hospitalized COVID-
19 patients receive either standard or high-neutralizing titer CCP, will allow this Project to contribute substantially to the
understanding of the immune response to SARS-CoV2."
11171016,"Abstract.
The UNC Center for Excellence in SARS-CoV2 Serologic Research uses basic and applied research
strategies to improve our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving serological and
humoral immune responses after SARS-CoV2 infection. COVD-19 pathogenesis can take a mild course with
few or no symptoms or it can progress to a more severe state requiring hospitalization and often results in
respiratory distress, secondary bacterial infections and death. It is clear the severity is due to the type and
magnitude of the immunological response to SARS-CoV2 infection. There is very little information about the
independent and cooperative effects of all phases of the immune response: innate and adaptive, namely humoral
(B cell/serologic), and cellular (T cell) and their clinical sequelae in COVID-19. However, clinical outcomes
(pulmonary hyper-inflammatory responses with concurrent immune suppression) of COVID-19 are strikingly
similar to that which we have studied with lung inhalation injuries and unresolved oronasalpharyngeal
inflammatory responses. Indeed, we and others have defined that the nature and magnitude of an innate immune
response to a pathogen directly affects the nature and magnitude of the specific humoral response systemically
and in the pathogen-tropic tissue (i.e. oronasopharynx/lung). Resulting antibodies (Ab) also shape many
subsequent innate immune functions of canonical immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages, as well
as barrier functions of mucosal cells such as epithelial cells. The additive effect of these interactions directly
impacts the short- and long-lived Ab repertoire.
Taken together, this Project will focus our investigations on defining unique and overlapping mechanisms of the
mucosal immune-mediated pathogenesis of COVID-19 which lead to mild and severe disease. We hypothesize
that the bi-directional interactions between the innate immune response and the serologic immune
response regulate and shape the severity of COVID-19. We will test this hypothesis by 1) revealing pulmonary
and systemic innate immune signatures, as a function of serology across the span of natural disease in human
patients, to identify indices which promote development of protective versus pathogenic Ab repertoires, while 2)
delineating mechanisms of polyclonal and monoclonal Ab mediated activation and suppression of innate immune
and mucosal cell function which drive severe versus mild disease in murine models of COVID-19. Taken
together, these data will inform us both mechanistically and therapeutically, defining antibody repertoires that
can interrupt or ameliorate disease. The integrated expertise of our Team and the Center as a whole is necessary
and sufficient to address the novel cross-cutting hypotheses put forth which will improve our understanding of
SARS-CoV2 serological and humoral immunity."
10684350,"risis of substance use in the US. In 2021, more than 107,000 overdose deaths occurred, setting yet another grim record. The substance use epidemic continues to threaten hard-fought gains in prevention and control of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) and related diseases. Identifying the best approach to reduce HIV and HCV transmission stemming from the substance use epidemic is of critical public health importance. 
In this extension to our MERIT award, our overall aims remain the same but we seek to extend and broaden our work in each of the aims in 3 key areas by: 1) developing new methods and conducting analyses that address health disparities; 2) incorporating social determinants of health in assessing barriers to program delivery and implementation and evaluating interventions to address those barriers; 3) expanding our work to encompass the intersecting syndemics of stimulant use, Covid-19, and other related conditions. We will:
1. Model the effect of the opioid and stimulant epidemic on transmission of HIV, HCV, and related diseases.
2. Model the epidemiologic and population impacts of individual strategies to prevent and mitigate the harms of opioid and stimulant use on HIV, HCV, and other disease-related outcomes. 
3. Model the epidemiologic and population impact of portfolios of strategies to mitigate the harms of opioid and stimulant use on HIV, HCV, and other disease-related outcomes. 
4. Model the impact of barriers (including social determinants of health) and enablers to implementation of effective strategies and portfolios of strategies to reduce the harms of opioid and stimulant use. 
Our work will provide clinicians, policymakers, and community organizations with critically needed guidance about strategies to mitigate the consequences of opioid and stimulant use and improve quality of life and health equity for people with substance use disorder."
10758959,"ABSTRACT/PROJECT SUMMARY
The habenulo-interpeduncular pathway, a forebrain to midbrain conduction system in the 
vertebrate brain, has been implicated in many essential processes, from sleep to fear/anxiety, 
pain, learning, motivation, feeding, reproduction, and reward, and in pathological states such 
as mood disorders and addiction. Despite its importance and diverse roles, little is known 
about the complete repertoire of neuronal subpopulations and precise connectivity between 
the bilaterally paired dorsal habenular nuclei (dHb) of the dorsal diencephalon and their major 
target, the unpaired interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) of the ventral midbrain. A renewed interest 
in this pathway came from its association with nicotine dependence and withdrawal and from 
the discovery that, in zebrafish and other vertebrates, the dHb develop with prominent left-right differences in their size, organization, molecular properties and connections to the IPN. 
In previous work, we described an asymmetric olfactory projection to a subset of neurons in 
the right dHb that helps mediate the response to aversive cues and determined that altering 
directional asymmetry of the dHb induces behavioral and physiological changes indicative of 
enhanced fear/anxiety. Using state-of-the-art genetic, transgenic, imaging, and behavioral 
approaches, we now aim to identify all of the neuronal populations of the Hb-IPN pathway 
and further define which groups of neurons are involved in the response to negative cues. 
We have also extended our studies to characterize the pre-synaptic input and post-synaptic 
targets of this conduction system to gain a more complete understanding of the underlying 
neural circuits and their connectivity. The proposed research will shed light on a poorly 
understood yet highly conserved neural pathway and also address how differential 
processing of information by neurons on the left and right sides of the brain leads to 
appropriate behavioral responses."

The common marmoset provides a very relevant primate model for understanding the organization of the human
nervous system and the diseases that affect it. Like humans, marmosets also demonstrate cooperative social
behavior and have advanced cognitive processes, making them of great interest in the field for modeling
developmental and psychiatric diseases and their therapies. They are also ideal for multigenerational genetic
experiments as they give birth twice a year and mature faster than most primates. However, while the
CRISPR/Cas9 system has been used to knockout genes and create knock-ins of single amino acids in a heritable
manner in marmosets, it has been a challenge in the field to create germline transmissible models of gene
reporters and trinucleotide repeat genes analogous to their murine counterparts. The very low efficiency of
homologous recombination (HR) in primates has precluded knocking-in coding sequences by simply injecting
Cas9 protein and a guide RNA into embryos during in vitro fertilization (IVF) as is done for creating knockouts.
This limitation has prevented modelling of more genetically complex neurological diseases such as Huntington’s
disease (HD) and for creating conditional reporters in marmosets, both of which are mainstays in the mouse
neurogenetics field. In addition to low HR frequency, other barriers to creating germline transmission of knock-
ins include the absence of a well annotated marmoset genome until recently, lack of protocols for derivation of
ground state marmoset pluripotent stem cells (cjPSCs), the low percentage of marmoset pregnancies after
embryo reimplantation, and a general deficiency of developmental biology expertise in the marmoset field. We
propose to harness our labs’ expertise in developmental biology, IVF technologies, and transgenic stem cell
biology to overcome this barrier to widespread use of marmosets. We aim to create transgenic knock-in cjPSCs,
convert them into ground-state pluripotent stem cells and then inject them into IVF morula to create a chimeric
founder marmoset that carries the modified genome. We then aim to screen the transgenic gametes from the
founder marmosets to create the F1 progeny and use them to correlate the molecular-behavioral phenotype of
HD. As proof-of-principle, we will focus on three knock-in reporter lines to broadly target excitatory, inhibitory,
and peripheral neuronal populations. Together, if successful, our aims will result in creation of the first primate
model with neuron-specific reporters, establish the marmoset as a valid model of HD, enable access to single-
cell transcriptomic changes at the early stages of HD in a primate disease model, and finally correlate these
molecular changes with the behavioral phenotype. These aims will provide fundamental insights into the biology
of HD and the role of huntingtin protein in different classes of neurons. The outcome of this project will also
influence a better understanding of poly-glutamine neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans. In addition,
the transgenic marmosets that we generate will be broadly available to the research community and enable new
studies into neural circuits, development, behavior, and a wide range of optogenetic applications."

11174107,"Advances in next-generation sequencing are enhancing the routine detection of human genetic variants,
particularly in clinical settings. Yet, the ability to interpret the functional consequences of these variants has
lagged far behind. While the identification of clinically actionable and pathogenic mutations has revolutionized
the field of precision medicine, these unfortunately represent a small minority of reported human genetic variants.
A large fraction of patients (~30-70%) who undergo diagnostic genome sequencing are found to have variants
of unknown significance (VUS), for which a clinical impact cannot be assigned. Multiple computational methods
have been designed to score the severity of a particular protein-coding mutation. While informative, predictions
from these methods are imperfect and do not give mechanistic insights into a variant’s impact. On the other
hand, laboratory-based functional genomics approaches have been used to characterize individual pathogenic
variants in human cell lines or model organisms, but these methods are low-throughput and can only focus on a
handful of mutations. Given the sheer volume of identified (and as-yet undiscovered) genetic variants in need of
clinical interpretation, there is a pressing need for high-throughput technologies to address this challenge. Here,
we describe complementary experimental and computational strategies for high-throughput
characterization of the impact of genetic variants in key regulatory and DNA repair genes. We focus on
mutations in ""trans-acting factors” such as chromatin regulators, transcription factors and DNA repair genes,
which are widely implicated in human disease. Mutations in these genes have the potential to induce widespread
transcriptomic, chromatin or genomic changes, and thus are most amenable to the strategies described in our
proposal. Notably, while these categories represent only a subset of clinically actionable genes, they nonetheless
encompass thousands of potential gene targets. We interrogate two classes of phenotypes: global
transcriptomic/chromatin changes induced by mutations to key transcription factors or other regulatory proteins,
and mutator phenotypes induced by disrupting proteins involved in DNA repair processes. We first develop
scBE-seq (single cell base editor sequencing), which combines pooled, high-precision genome editing with
single-cell sequencing assays to interrogate effects of hundreds of variants simultaneously. scBE-seq leverages
chemical base editing (BE) to introduce specific single nucleotide variants (SNVs). In parallel, we develop
computational approaches leveraging genomics datasets from large biobanks to identify genes harboring high-
impact variants which can be followed up using scBE-seq. Overall, our proposal brings together complementary
expertise spanning computational human genomics, molecular biology, genome editing and
development/implementation of genomic technologies. We envision the proposed experimental and
computational strategies will make important advances in the ability to interpret the impact of individual variants
in a variety of contexts and provide insights for predicting the effects of previously unobserved genetic variants."
11174108,"Developed for linkage and candidate gene studies, family-based association tests (FBATs) have played a
fundamental role in the disease mapping efforts of the human genome project. Originally conceived for studies
of affected offspring and their parents, FBATs are joint tests for linkage and association that are robust against
confounding due to population substructure by virtue of their design. In terms of the trait/phenotype of interest,
FBATs do not require distributional assumptions. In combination with its user-friendly software implementation,
the robustness and model-free features of FBAT made the software a frequently used analysis tool that has
contributed to several thousand research projects world-wide. Since its first release in 2001, the package has
been constantly adapted to the changing analysis needs of its user community. The approach has been extended
to general pedigrees, complex phenotypes, and haplotype analyses. With the arrival of genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) and whole-genome sequencing studies (WGS), multiple-testing strategies and rare-variant
analysis approaches have been developed and implemented, which has enabled its continuing use in current
WGS studies. However, the full potential of FBAT for WGS studies is restricted by the available null-hypotheses
that can be tested and by its current software implementation that does not support modern, efficient file-formats
for genotype data and that does not utilize parallel/distributed computing. In this application, we will expand the
testing capabilities of FBAT by implementing additional null-hypotheses that are relevant for the analysis of WGS
data. In WGS analyses, multiple association signals are often detected within the same genomic region and it is
unclear whether they stem from multiple disease susceptibility loci (DSLs) or whether a single DSL creates
multiple association signals through linkage disequilibrium. We will address this research question by enabling
FBAT to condition the test statistics on other loci with association signals in the same region and thereby, assess
the independent contribution of the tested loci to the association. Many genetic association signals have been
discovered in studies of unrelated individuals with large sample sizes and relatively small effect sizes. These
findings may be false positives or caused by unmeasured confounding in the association analysis. While the
contribution of family-based studies is often limited in large scale mapping efforts as their sample sizes are much
smaller than the number of unrelated samples, family-based studies can play a pivotal role in validating findings
given their robustness against genetic confounding and their non-parametric modelling of the outcome. We will
introduce equivalence testing into FBAT, which will allow the user to conclude the absence of a genetic effect of
meaningful magnitude. Regarding the software implementation, FBAT will be able to accommodate commonly
used binary file formats for the genetic data in addition to the plain text files, which are currently the only
supported files formats. To take full advantage of modern Linux clusters with multi-core CPUs, we will add parallel
and distributed computing capabilities to FBAT."
11134461,"Project Summary/Abstract
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a leading cause of heart failure and the leading reason for heart
transplantation. Major gaps exist in our understanding of the pathophysiology of DCM and mutations in the
gene that encodes the nuclear envelope proteins lamin A and C (LMNA) are considered to be the most
common cause of DCM. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie “cardiolaminopathy” remain
elusive, and it is unknown why mutations in this ubiquitously expressed gene have such a disproportionate
effect on the heart. Using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs)-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs), we
recently studied a family affected by DCM due to a frameshift variant in LMNA, which showed endothelial
dysfunction (Sayed et al. Science Translational Medicine, 2020). This EC dysfunction could be reversed by
upregulating Krüppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2) by treatment of iPSC-ECs with a subset of statins, including
lovastatin. Importantly, this improvement in EC dysfunction had a positive effect on co-cultured iPSC-
cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) from cardiolaminopathy patients, indicating an intricate crosstalk between the ECs
and CMs in LMNA cardiomyopathy.
 Despite impressive progress, little attention has been given to the potential importance of cell-to-cell
signaling between ECs and CMs, despite the fact that ECs serve a paracrine function to enhance signaling in
CMs, especially in context to pharmacological stimulation. This knowledge gap impedes our comprehensive
understanding of organ dysfunction at a multi-cellular level. The overarching goal of our proposal is to use a
multidisciplinary approach that integrates human iPSCs, bioengineering tools, genome editing, and NGS to
gain novel insights into the pathogenesis of DCM. Using human iPSCs, we propose to decipher the impaired
cross-talk between ECs and CMs in LMNA cardiomyopathy and elucidate the beneficial class effects of statins
in improving the EC-CM signaling as a key factor in regulating cardiac function. We will pursue three specific
aims. In Aim 1: we will establish an experimental platform to study the genotype-phenotype association of
LMNA mutations on ECs and CMs. For this, we will recapitulate the EC-CM crosstalk in LMNA iPSC-derived
cells with 3D engineered heart tissues (EHTs). In Aim 2: we will decipher the mechanism of EC-CM crosstalk
in LMNA iPSC-derived EHTs using single-cell approaches (scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq). In Aim 3: we will
validate the key regulatory players of EC-CM crosstalk in LMNA cardiomyopathy by using CRISPR technology
and zebrafish animal model. We have provided compelling preliminary data to support the soundness of
our hypothesis-driven research proposal, and we are well positioned to achieve the project goals
within five years. If successful, our studies will provide a new paradigm for understanding the
pathogenesis and treatment of familial DCM."
11171633,"Autoimmune disease is one of the leading causes of death for young and middle-aged women in the US.
These diseases are mediated by autoreactive T cells, which are naturally contained by T regulatory cells
(Tregs). Non-functional mutations in the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) lead to autoimmunity due to deficiencies in Treg
survival and function. This finding is corroborated by in vivo mouse models, leading to the widespread
conclusion that IL-2 is important for Treg survival. However, recent data indicates this is oversimplified. Our lab
studies a mouse model in which the alpha chain (CD25) of the IL-2R on peripheral Tregs is conditionally
ablated. CD25 knockout Tregs demonstrate a disproportionate loss of central Tregs, which are long-lived
circulating Tregs that give rise to effectors to maintain self-tolerance. Bulk knockout Tregs also display
disruptions in critical Treg processes such as proliferation, survival, metabolism and suppressive function.
Additionally, there is an absence of highly suppressive terminally differentiated Tregs in IL-2R mutant animals,
indicating IL-2 may regulate the development of highly suppressive Tregs required for maintain peripheral
tolerance. Given these findings, IL-2 signaling controls processes that are essential for the prevention of
autoimmunity and understanding this role can provide therapeutic avenues to manipulate this population. Aim
1 will determine the effects of IL-2 on survival, proliferation, function and metabolism in Treg subsets.
Using flow cytometry and in vitro assays, proliferation, apoptosis, survival, function and metabolism will be
examined in Tregs subsets with and without IL-2 signaling. This aim will inform the extent to which IL-2
regulates cellular processes in Tregs subsets to further define the way by which IL-2 maintains Treg
populations. Aim 2 will evaluate the role of IL-2 in Treg differentiation and heterogeneity. Due to defects
observed in the differentiation of Tregs in the setting of IL-2, this aim will use adoptively transferred Treg
subsets with and without IL-2 signaling to determine how IL-2 regulates development of eTregs from cTregs.
Aim 3 will define the distinct IL-2 dependent transcriptional and epigenetic processes in cTregs versus
eTregs. This aim will harness high throughput techniques such as RNAseq and ATAC-seq to correlate
epigenetic and transcriptional changes as a consequence of IL-2 signaling, or lack thereof, in Treg subsets. By
defining IL-2-dependent pathways and cellular processes that differ between them, these findings will be
integrated with those in aim 1 to provide a clear role for IL-2 in regulating the cellular processes in each Treg
subset. The main objective of this fellowship research is to define IL-2 driven processes coordinating Treg
survival and homeostasis that are acutely relevant for understanding therapeutic applications of this cytokine
and broadly relevant for understanding autoimmune disease."

Newly emerging and long-standing infectious challenges, including arboviruses, Ebola virus and pandemic
coronaviruses (CoVs), among others, pose serious public health concerns. Additionally, the potential use of
biological agents as weapons of mass destruction poses an ongoing threat to humanity. All of these issues
have in common the need for development strategies that allow for the rapid design, screening and
formulation of potential vaccine candidates. We have developed a “designer nanoparticle” platform based on
λ phage-like particles, or nanophages (NPs), that can display multiple antigenic biomolecules alone and in
combination in rigorously defined ratios. The NPs can be rapidly modified to screen and evaluate potential
vaccine candidates against newly emerging threats. Herein we propose to develop tools and technologies for
rapid screening of multivalent vaccine candidates effective for current and emerging SARS-CoVs and pre-
emergent SARS-like CoVs. We will engineer “second generation” nanophages (NPs) that display the spike
receptor binding domain (RBD) for these pathogens, the primary target of neutralizing antibody (Ab)
responses. Physiochemical and structural characterization of the preparations will be employed to ensure
that they possess properties that are appropriate for a pharmaceutical preparation. We will also employ a
novel atomic layer deposition technology to generate thermostable, timed-release, single-shot vaccine
formulations that reduce or eliminate onerous “cold-chain” requirements for their distribution. We further
propose to determine the immunogenicity and protective capacity of mosaic NPs engineered to
simultaneously display multiple antigens. These studies will identify vaccine candidates that elicit potent,
durable, and broad neutralizing Ab and T cell responses and protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2
variants and pre-emergent SARS-like bat CoVs. In addition to developing this powerful platform and
implementing novel formulation strategies, these studies will help define mechanisms of immunogenicity and
develop a platform for the rapid engineering of vaccine candidates for existing and untoward emerging
biological threats. In sum, this application seeks to provide compelling evidence that the  nanophage system
provides a platform for facile and rapid generation, and formulation of highly active multi-antigen presenting
vaccines."

11174757,"PROJECT SUMMARY: OVERALL
The Fred Hutchinson/University of Washington Cancer Consortium (“the Consortium”) brings together more
than 600 members with research interests in basic, clinical and public health sciences related to cancer. The
goal of the Consortium is the elimination of cancer as a cause of suffering and death through more effective
prevention, diagnostics, and treatment, deriving from fundamental insights into the biology of the disease. The
extensive interdisciplinary collaboration among the partner institutions in the cancer research disciplines of
basic, clinical, and public health sciences affords new opportunities to reduce suffering and mortality from
cancer.
The Consortium was established in 2002 to build upon the complementary strengths and resources of three
partner institutions: the Fred Hutch, which has been an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center since
1976; the University of Washington, which has significant strength in cancer research, clinical care, and
teaching; and Seattle Children’s, the major pediatric academic center in the region. In 2008, the Seattle Cancer
Care Alliance, the cancer treatment center founded and equally co-owned by the three founding institutions,
was formally added to the cancer center designation.
The Consortium’s total funding base (direct dollars) is $242M, of which $117M is peer-reviewed, including
$50M from the NCI. During the last grant period, over 170 new faculty members joined the Consortium, adding
breadth and depth to our research and clinical capabilities. In the most recent year, we enrolled 1,338 patients
onto interventional treatment trials, of which more than 50% were investigator-initiated. The ratio of accruals to
newly registered patients was 28%.
The Consortium serves a catchment area of 13 counties in western Washington. This equates to the region in
which 83 percent of our patients reside. As the only NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center in a five-
state region (Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho), we not only seek to serve the health needs
of the catchment area through research, training, and outreach, but also to ensure high impact throughout the
larger region.
The Consortium continues to build upon historic strengths in basic cancer biology, immunology and
transplantation, pathogen associated malignancies, tumor specific translational research, computational
biology and studies of cancer etiology, prevention, and outcomes. The Consortium is well poised to continue its
exceptional level of research in these areas. The CCSG continues to have a high impact on the Consortium,
fostering new inter-institutional collaborations, strengthening the translational research platform, and
intensifying research efforts on problems of the catchment area. Partner institutions contributed nearly $1.2
billion in institutional support during the last project period, including investments in our laboratory and clinical
research infrastructure as well as in faculty recruitment and trainee support."

The UNC Center for Excellence in SARS-CoV2 Serologic Research uses basic and applied research
strategies to improve our understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms driving serological and
humoral immune responses after SARS-CoV2 infection. Our overall goals are to 1) characterize the immune
responses elicited to SARS-CoV2 infection, 2) understand the mechanisms driving the serological, humoral and
cellular immune responses, 3) determine modifiers of the serologic memory and 4) determine the serological
correlates of disease pathogenesis, and protection against future infection. The program includes three
Research Projects led by internationally renowned exerts in coronavirus emergence, pathogenesis and immunity
(Project 1: Baric), clinical and translational mucosal and systemic immune correlates of disease (Project 2:
Bartelt & Margolis) and host-pathogen interactions driving innate and serological immunity (Project 3: Wallet
& Maile). Program-wide support is provided by an Administrative Core A and two Shared Resource Cores B and
C. Core A includes a robust infrastructure for programmatic oversight as well as participant recruitment, sample
collection, tracking and sharing (Core A: Baric & Wallet). Core B is led by world renowned experts in
characterization of human antibodies in protection and pathogenesis of disease (Core B: de Silva &
Lakshmanane) and will provide recombinant spike protein antigens from SARS-CoV-2 as well as antigen-
specific serological assays required for accomplishing the aims of all three Research Projects. Core C is led by
serological experts (Core C: Ippolitto, Georgiou & Lavinder) who have revolutionized techniques to
comprehensively analyze the molecular composition of the serological antibody repertoire (IgG and IgA) and the
cellular antibody repertoire (i.e. B cell receptor) and thus will delineate these repertoires in and isolate human
monoclonal antibodies from SARS-CoV-2+ individuals in cohorts defined in each Research Project. All three
Research Projects are integrated, and each require the support of all three Cores. To this end, Project 1 will
characterize the breadth and potency of polyclonal neutralizing antibody responses as well as determine the
kinetics, magnitude and durability of the type-specific and cross neutralizing responses in both the systemic and
mucosal compartments. Project 2 will determine the durability and the breadth of anti-SARS-CoV-2 serum
antibodies and memory B-cells generated among convalescent plasma donors as well as determine the effect
of convalescent plasma on the innate, adaptive and antibody repertoire in recipients. Project 3 will reveal innate
immune signatures as a function of serology across the span of natural disease, as well as identify signatures
which promote development of protective vs. pathogenic antibody repertoires, while delineating mechanisms of
antibody mediated activation and suppression of innate immune function which drives severe vs. mild disease
respectively. The integrated expertise of our Team is necessary and sufficient to address the novel cross-cutting
hypotheses put forth which will improve our understanding of SARS-CoV2 serological and humoral immunity."
11171035,"ASBTRACT Overview
Every day, Californians continue to experience high levels of exposure to the novel severe acute respiratory
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. There is an ever-growing urgent need to better understand the nature of
exposures, course of illness and recovery, and potential for immunity among persons at particularly heightened
risk for the worst COVID-19 outcomes. As part of a rapid scientific response to the present public health crisis,
we convened on March 18, 2020 a collaborative of frontline clinicians and scientists to form the Coronavirus Risk
Associations and Longitudinal Evaluation (CORALE) studies (corale-study.org). We established two base study
cohorts with enrollment centered on (i) patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 treated in our health
system (currently N>8,300) and on (ii) healthcare workers directly or indirectly involved in delivering their care
(currently N=6,679). In response to NIH RFA-CA-20-038, we are now highly motivated and prepared to leverage
our existing infrastructure to directly address the critical need for comprehensive longitudinal data collection and
analyses to advanced our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 risks, the course of disease, the nature of recovery,
and the potential for immunity across populations at risk. By establishing the CORALE-SeroNet U54 program,
our goal will be to form a robust and sustainable structure of academic activities centered on investigating the
responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 exposure and the extent to which carefully phenotyped clinical and molecular
profiles can signal robust immune reconstitution and complete functional recovery. Our study will be centered
on the ethnically/racially diverse population served by our health system in Los Angeles, given then critical need
for more knowledge regarding the determinants of COVID-19 related risks in these minority subgroups. Our
scientific objectives will be achieved by an outstanding collaborative team of clinician-scientists, epidemiologists,
immunologists, basic and translational scientists, analytical chemists, and biostatisticians. Leveraging our
collective experience, resources, and infrastructure at major academic institutions from across Southern
California (Cedars Sinai, UCSD, UCLA, and USC), we will advance the scientific enterprise through the three
distinct yet closely integrated research Projects: Project 1 will elucidate the natural history and longitudinal
trajectories that represent the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, infection, recovery, and clinical immunity
patterns across the spectrum of persons at risk. Project 2 will investigate the determinants of SARS-CoV-2
response in persons with altered innate immune function, with a focus on individuals with pre-infection
susceptibility traits (e.g. metabolic disease states); and, Project 3 will investigate the determinants of SARS-
CoV-2 response in persons with altered adaptive immune function, with a focus on individuals with immune-
altered status arising from select malignancies, autoimmune disease, and/or their directed therapies. As a whole
this research program will integrate population, clinical, translational, and basic science resources with a world-
class investigator team to meet the urgent need for new mechanistic insights and therapeutic approaches to
address key knowledge gaps regarding SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility and potential for immunity."

11173930,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are major sources of health, social, and economic burden.
The lack of effective ADRD therapies or strategies to prevent or stop ADRD progression presents a significant
public health challenge in the context of aging populations. A focus on resilience, instead of disease, may
provide insight into novel treatment and prevention modalities. Cognitively resilient individuals typically retain
normal cognitive function despite advanced age or brain pathology. The genetic architectures of cognitive
resilience and Alzheimer's disease appear distinct based on recent genomic work. However, further
interrogation of the biologic basis of cognitive resilience, including the interplay between genetic and
environmental factors, is necessary to design targeted interventions that build cognitive resilience in older
adults. We posit that a multi-omics approach can identify novel cognitive resilience loci and elucidate pathways
that promote cognitive resilience and lower the risk of ADRD. We propose to use extant genomic data, high-
quality longitudinal measurements of 5,000 plasma proteins, repeat psychometric assessments, and
neuroimaging in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study to accomplish the following specific
aims: (1) employ a multi-omic approach to identify causal loci and biomarkers for cognitive resilience in
community-dwelling older adults and (2) decompose the genetic and environmental drivers of cognitive
resilience. In Aim 1, we will conduct a proteome-wide association study (PWAS) to identify proteins associated
with cognitive resilience. Given heterogeneity in the measure of cognitive resilience in epidemiologic studies,
we will use psychometric and imaging-based definitions of cognitive resilience. We will also identify protein
quantitative trait loci, perform fine-mapping, and use Mendelian Randomization to identify causal markers of
cognitive resilience. In Aim 2, we will build and validate a polygenic risk score (PRS) for cognitive resilience.
The PRS will be applied to model the interplay of genetic and modifiable environmental factors on cognitive
resilience. This award will support my transition to aging research and my immediate and long-term goals
through (1) advanced training in molecular, neuro-, and aging epidemiology and (2) the mentored application of
these methods in an innovative research question aligned with priorities in population aging research. With the
dedication of a highly qualified and enthusiastic team of mentors, the successful completion of these aims will
deepen the field's understanding of the determinants of cognitive resilience. Further, the training objectives
nested in the F99 and K00 phases of this award will prepare me for a career in which I will lead an
interdisciplinary team as an independent investigator in aging research"
11173934,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In partnership with Deaf-owned agency National Deaf Therapy (NDT), we propose the first-ever full-scale
psychotherapy trial conducted in the Deaf community. The U.S. Deaf community – more than 500,000
Americans who communicate using American Sign Language (ASL) – experiences nearly triple the rate of
lifetime problem drinking compared to the general population and twice the rate of trauma exposure. Hearing
individuals have access to several validated treatments for comorbid alcohol use disorder (AUD) and trauma;
yet there are no evidence-based treatments to treat any behavioral health condition with Deaf clients.
Available behavioral health treatments fail to meet Deaf clients’ unique language access needs. Deaf people’s
median English literacy level falls at the fourth grade and health-related vocabulary parallels non-English-
speaking U.S. immigrants. Leveraging extensive community engagement to address these barriers, the PI’s
team of Deaf and hearing researchers, clinicians, filmmakers, actors, artists, and Deaf people with AUD/PTSD
developed and pilot tested Signs of Safety, a Deaf-accessible toolkit to be used with the Seeking Safety
treatment protocol. The Signs of Safety toolkit provides a supplemental therapist guide and population-specific
client materials (e.g., visual handouts, filmed ASL teaching stories) to meet Deaf clients’ language needs.
Preliminary data from the Signs of Safety single-arm pilot and randomized feasibility pilot showed reductions in
alcohol use frequency and PTSD severity from baseline to follow-up. The delivery of the experimental
intervention was deemed feasible by study therapists and was well-received by participants, especially when
moved to a virtual platform in response to the COVID-19 pandemic – an acceleration of the inevitable
development needed to scale Signs of Safety to a national level for the proposed clinical trial.
Leveraging the existing infrastructure and robust referral network of NDT, we will enroll 144 Deaf adults with
past-month PTSD and problem drinking into a national, full-scale, virtual clinical trial comparing (1) Signs of
Safety with (2) treatment as usual and (3) a no treatment control. Primary clinical outcomes at immediate post-
treatment and post-treatment follow-up are past 30-day alcohol use frequency/quantity (Alcohol Timeline
Followback) and past 30-day PTSD severity (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5). Assessment will occur at baseline,
mid-treatment, immediate post-treatment, three-month post-treatment follow-up, and six-month post-treatment
follow-up. Additionally, we will analyze potential moderators and mediators that lead to positive outcome,
including coping self-efficacy, self-compassion, motivation for treatment, and access to health information.
Our proposed aims build on eight years of KL2 and R34 empirical work, moving this program of research from
Stage IB (two-arm feasibility and pilot testing) to Stage II/III (real world efficacy). The proposed R01 will
potentially validate the first-ever evidence-based therapy for Deaf people, as well as provide future behavioral
health researchers with a vital roadmap for conducting community-engaged clinical trials with Deaf people."

The applicant for this NIH Diversity K01 (RFA-HL-19-026) application is Dr. Mary Sheppard, an Assistant
Professor at the University of Kentucky, College of Medicine. Dr. Sheppard’s area of research interest is
Marfan syndrome, and she has established an Aortic Clinic in the Department of Surgery. Her long term career
goal is to develop new therapeutics for thoracic aortic aneurysm. This decision was influenced by her personal
challenges with this diagnosis. Desiring more treatment options, Dr. Sheppard has decided to embark on
additional training in basic science research. Her short term goals, which form the basis for the research plan,
are: (1) to develop preclinical research skills that will enable her to identify new therapeutic targets to treat
vascular diseases; (2) to establish herself as an expert in aneurysm research; and (3) to submit an R01
funding application upon this project’s completion. Dr. Sheppard has assembled an impressive mentoring team
composed of Drs. Daugherty, Cassis, Graf, and Milewicz. Her primary mentor, Dr. Daugherty, has extensive
expertise in animal models of aneurysm formation, and he has been a successfully funded NIH investigator for
several decades. Co-mentor Dr. Lisa Cassis is an expert in the renin-angiotensin system and sexual
dimorphism of aortic aneurysms. Co-mentor Dr. Greg Graf is an expert in cholesterol metabolism and statin
pharmacology. Dr. Dianna Milewicz, an expert in medical genetics, has a career in translational studies
focused on genetic predisposition to vascular diseases. All mentors are senior scientists with a track record of
successfully mentoring new faculty to independent NIH funding. This mentor team will assist Dr. Sheppard in
learning laboratory techniques which include advanced microscopy, subcellular fractionation,
immunohistochemistry, and fluorescence activated cell sorting. The proposed research will examine the
mechanisms by which statins attenuate thoracic aortic aneurysm growth in a mouse model of Marfan
syndrome. The impact of Ras farnesylation on aneurysm growth, Raf/ERK expression, matrix
metalloproteinase activity, elastin fragmentation, and leukocyte accumulation will be evaluated in Aim 1. The
impact of statin combined with β-adrenoceptor antagonist or angiotensin receptor blocker in thoracic aortic
aneurysm will be investigated in Aim 2. The findings of these studies will form the preliminary data for an R01
research application which will transition Dr. Sheppard from trainee status to independent physician-scientist."
11174935,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Transposable elements (TEs) are genomic parasites that can negatively impact host viability and fertility. They
have been identified as the causes of inherited human disorders and cancers. Despite their detrimental effects,
TEs are prevalent across eukaryotic genomes and exhibit dramatic variation in abundance and genomic
positions within and between species. For instance, the proportion of vertebrate genomes occupied by TEs
ranges from only 6% in pufferfish to 65% in salamander. Over 45% of the human genome harbors TEs, and
any two people differ by at least a thousand TE insertions. However, it remains unclear what evolutionary
forces drive TE variation and how that influences functions and, thereby, host health. Most studies of the
harmful effects of TEs have centered on TE-mediated physical disruption of DNA and changes in DNA
sequences. While such genetic disturbances have important consequences, this paradigm overlooks the
detrimental epigenetic effects mediated by TEs, including biochemical modifications of chromatin and
reorganization of three-dimensional (3D) genome structures. My recent pioneering studies revealed, on a
genome-wide scale, that epigenetically silenced TEs can perturb the function of neighboring genes through cis
spreading of silencing marks (cis epigenetic effects of TEs) and alter 3D genome organization (3D epigenetic
effects of TEs). These exciting observations offer a possibility to answer long-unresolved questions about why
there are between-species differences in TE content and how these differences affect genome function and
evolution—the overarching goals of my research program. My laboratory uses Drosophila as a primary model
and integrates evolutionary genomics and cell biology to decipher the functional and evolutionary significance
of TE variation. One major goal of my research program is to determine how TE variation influences genome
evolution through my newly discovered 3D epigenetic effects of TEs. My research group will use integrative
genomic analysis at multiple levels (DNA, RNA, epigenetics, and 3D genome structures) to investigate our
hypothesis that the 3D epigenetic effects mediated by TEs can produce varying 3D genome organization. We
further predict that this TE-mediated variation in 3D genome structures can shape genome evolution by
affecting fundamental genetic processes. In addition, my laboratory seeks to identify the molecular and
evolutionary mechanisms contributing to between-species differences in TE content. We will use Drosophila
genetics and transgenics to identify host genetic factors that modulate the epigenetic effects of TEs in cis and
in 3D nuclear space. Furthermore, we will combine comparative evolutionary genomics and experimental
evolution to investigate our hypothesis that between-species variation in these host genetic factors contributes
to varying epigenetic effects of TEs and ultimately drives the evolution of divergent TE content across
Drosophila species. Our discoveries will provide a novel basis for understanding eukaryotic genome evolution
and open new perspectives for TEs' roles in human health and disease."
11171251,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of NIGMS-funded research in my lab is to define the molecular and cellular
mechanisms that control cell size and shape. Defects in cell size and shape are associated with
human diseases including cancer, so defining the underlying mechanisms can identify future
therapeutic targets. We use the fission yeast S. pombe as a model system to study these
fundamental processes. These rod-shaped eukaryotic cells grow by linear extension due to
polarized secretion at growing cell tips, and enter mitosis at a highly reproducible size due to
regulated activation of the ubiquitous cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1. Decades of genetic screens
have identified an extensive “parts list” for regulation of cell size and shape. Our current challenge
is to assemble these parts into defined signaling networks that spatially control cell growth and
activate Cdk1 in a size-dependent manner. For this work, we take a multidisciplinary approach
that combines genetics, quantitative live-cell microscopy, phosphoproteomics, and biochemical
reconstitution.
In this proposal, we will address four key unanswered questions. First, how do cortical multiprotein
clusters called “nodes” control fission yeast cell size at division? We discovered that nodes
contain conserved cell cycle regulators including the protein kinases Cdr2, Cdr1, and Wee1, but
we do not know the mechanisms of assembly or signal transduction within nodes. Second, what
is the role of multiple cell cycle pathways in monitoring aspects of cell size such as volume and
surface area? We will focus on the mitotic inducers Cdc25 and Cdc13/cyclin, with the goal of
generating systems-level knowledge supported by mathematical modeling. Third, how do cell
polarity mechanisms that function far away from the growing cell tips contribute to cell shape? We
will exploit our recent discoveries that implicate RNA granules and SNARE protein clusters as
novel “at-a-distance” regulators of cell polarity and shape. Fourth, how do cell size and shape
influence spatial patterning of nodes in cells? We have identified cell tips, cortical anchors, and
the nucleus as critical regulators of node positioning. We will combine genetic mutants with
quantitative fluorescence microscopy and particle-based simulations to define the underlying
design principles of this system. Based on extensive conservation of these pathways and
processes between yeast and mammals, we fully expect that discoveries from our work will impact
and guide future work in other organisms and biological systems."

My long-term goal is to help develop and deliver regeneration therapeutics useful for the clinical treatment of
hearing loss. Unfortunately, at this time there is no high throughput, non-destructive method of therapeutic
delivery into the cochlea/inner ear. The objectives of this proposal, the next step toward the attainment of this
long-term goal, are to use a relevant large animal model (the pig) to i) develop an ex-vivo model system, which
mimics human round window membrane (RWM), to track the passage of therapy-related substances through
the RWM, and ii) create a method to enhance the intratympanic delivery of therapeutics into the inner ear using
nanovesicles including extracellular vesicles (exosomes). The central hypothesis, supported by our preliminary
data, is that an ex-vivo porcine RWM model can be used to determine optimal conditions for the transport of
exosomes (or other nanovesicles) to deliver cargo through the RWM into the inner ear, thereby facilitating the
high-efficiency delivery of therapeutics. The rationale for this proposal is that its successful completion is likely
to offer a framework whereby a new pool of therapeutics can be tested for non-surgical delivery into the inner
ear, in a large animal model that has the preclinical advantage over rodents in terms of size, physiology, and
genetic similarity (amino-acid sequences of common deafness genes) to humans. The following specific aims
will be pursued during K99 (aim 1 and 2) and R00 phase: Aim 1) To further validate the ex-vivo porcine RWM
model to demonstrate drug permeability equivalent to that reported for human tissue; Aim 2) To identify and
evaluate exosomes and other nanovesicles enhancing cargo transport across porcine RWM in-vitro; Aim 3) To
evaluate in-vivo transport across porcine RWM by nanovesicles. Under the first aim, we will measure the
permeability of therapeutics with known delivery efficiencies and some promising therapy related materials using
a preliminary viability-verified ex-vivo RWM model and compare those with values reported for human tissue.
For the second aim, nanovesicles including: RWM exosomes (successfully isolated and characterized as a
preliminary result), mesenchymal stem cell exosomes (gold standard), and liposomes (FDA approved), that are
loaded with promising therapeutics will be evaluated for the efficiency of transport using the ex-vivo RWM model.
Finally, for the last aim, once the parameters associated with optimal transport through the RWM are established
with the ex-vivo model, we will inject therapeutic-loaded nanovesicles through the porcine tympanic membrane
and measure their passage across RWM and uptake by cochlear cells in vivo. Upon completion of the K99, the
expected outcomes are 1. Availability of a safe and translatable platform to test transport of therapeutics into the
inner ear, and 2. Data on the efficiency of nanovesicles as novel nonsurgical transport of promising therapeutics
to the ear. These results are expected to have a positive impact because they could improve drug screening for
delivery and is likely to boost delivering novel regenerative therapeutics to treat and prevent hearing loss."

11174954,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Out of 100,000 children and adolescents, 120 will have Down Syndrome, 56 will die from
sudden infant death syndrome, 15 will be diagnosed with cancer, 12 will develop Type II
diabetes, and 2,900 will have an eating disorder (ED). Although the age of onset for EDs was
traditionally observed in adolescence, onset is occurring younger, with many children
developing EDs by age 12. Estimates suggest there will be 1.9 million new cases of youth EDs
by 2024. Despite the high prevalence, costs, impairment, and deaths from EDs, there is very
little knowledge on what predisposes children to develop EDs. Importantly, early detection and
intervention is crucial: problematic eating behaviors can damage developing brains and bodies,
and untreated EDs carry significant risk for becoming lifelong chronic health conditions,
associated with high mortality rates, societal and personal burden. Our scientific premise,
developed from our past work, is that anxiety and interoceptive deficits (inaccuracy identifying
bodily sensations, heightened or blunted sensitivity to these sensations), as well as deficits in
fear learning underlying anxiety and interoceptive deficits, will predict common, problematic
eating behaviors and cognitions (e.g., restriction, body dissatisfaction, cognitive restraint), as
well as clinical EDs. Our study goals are to (1) test if childhood anxiety and interoceptive deficits
are risk factors for problematic eating behaviors and cognitions and EDs and (2) test if deficits in
fear learning are a mechanism by which anxiety and interoceptive deficits contribute to risk.
These goals will ultimately lead to (a) tools that can better detect childhood risk factors for EDs
and (b) prevention efforts directly targeting mechanisms predictive of ED onset. The proposed
research uses innovative parent-report momentary assessment combined with well-established
diagnostic, behavioral, observational, and physiological assessment. We will recruit a sample of
400 girls across two age cohorts (6-8; 10-12 years old) enriched for interoceptive deficits,
anxiety, and EDs; 75% (n=300) will be recruited based on maternal history of EDs or anxiety,
and 25% (n=100) will make up the control group. This study will, for the first time, allow us to
begin to quantify how early symptoms of ED develop. The specific aims are to test (1) multi-
modal aspects of anxiety and (2) characteristics of interoceptive deficits that may prospectively
predict problematic eating behaviors and cognitions and EDs, and (3) mechanisms of prediction
among anxiety and interoceptive deficits. The proposed research has clinical impact: ultimately,
this study will lead to early detection and prevention of EDs in childhood and beyond, averting
the large personal and societal costs associated with both childhood onset and chronic EDs."
11174986,"Project Summary/Abstract
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is characterized by a stiff heart which cannot fill
adequately with blood, without increasing filling (left atrial) pressure, which in turn results in
pulmonary congestion. Patients with HFpEF have unexplained breathlessness upon exercise. Its
hemodynamic correlate is elevated cardiac pressures. HFpEF is common, represents 50% of all HF,
and has similar mortality rates as HF with reduced ejection fraction (50% in five years). A major
challenge for HFpEF is that diagnosis by echocardiography is challenging, with many inconclusive
studies, and accuracy of about 68% to predict high pressures, with especially low sensitivity.
Therapies for HFpEF are lacking, and their development would be aided by better identification of
HFpEF. MRI is not able to diagnose HFpEF at all. To overcome these challenges, we propose to
develop MRI methods for diastolic function, including an approach to measuring tricuspid regurgitant
flow velocity, which is used to estimate pressures in the right heart, a key metric in diastolic function
evaluation. This method uses deep learning processing of long-axis cines to generate a dynamic
slice plane prescription, which is used in valve-tracking phase-contrast to measure tricuspid
regurgitant flow. This same technique, suitably modified can measure all or many of the diastolic
parameters (E, A, e' etc). To this end, we develop a valve-tracking PC approach which is carefully
tested in phantoms and human subjects, comparing regurgitation velocities by MRI vs. the standard.
We also develop methods for diastolic evaluation with 4D flow, including bSSFP 4D flow, with an
innovative approach. Then the importance of exercise is studied to unmask diastolic dysfunction. All
of these techniques are applied in patient cohorts where excellent ground truth data is available, first
in patients with correlative echocardiography and MRI (n=40), secondly in patients with implanted
pulmonary artery pressure sensors (n=20, imaged at two time points and using rest/stress, and thirdly
in patients with invasive right heart catheterization to measure all pressure data (n=40). We
hypothesize that MRI can measure TR pressure gradients accurately, and can detect changes in
diastolic parameters with exercise. We hypothesize that a single breath-held valve-tracking phase-
contrast acquisition could be used for diastolic evaluation of all needed parameters. We envision that
every cardiac MRI exam can employ a few additional breath-holds to fully evaluate diastolic function,

More than 37 million people are estimated to have CKD in the US, and 2 in every 1000 Americans need dialysis or a kidney transplant to survive. Anemia and dysfunctional iron homeostasis frequently complicate CKD. Kidney fibrosis is the final mechanism common for all progressive kidney disorders leading to CKD. However, very few therapies are available to slow the progression of kidney fibrosis in CKD patients. Our long-term goal is to identify novel actionable drivers of kidney fibrosis, so that they can be therapeutically targeted to delay progression of CKD. Proximal tubular epithelial cells represent the key cell population implicated in the pathophysiology of kidney fibrosis and may accumulate iron in CKD. The overall objective of this proposal is to define the role of iron homeostasis in responses of these cells to fibrosis, which are responsible for CKD progression. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in CKD, tubular cells are highly sensitive to labile iron. Nonetheless, the following two cytoprotective mechanisms initially limit tubular iron toxicity in CKD by preventing an uncontrolled expansion of the tubular labile iron pool: (1) induction of tubular iron export and (2) induction of intracellular storage of iron within the tubular cells. We expect that these protective mechanisms fail during iron supplementation unless they are enhanced therapeutically. This hypothesis will be tested in two sets of experiments that will increase or decrease labile iron pool in tubular cells, and we will define the consequential changes of tubular injury, survival, and fibrosis that constitute the disease progression. Studies will be facilitated by induction of CKD in our mutant mice lacking critical iron-related proteins in proximal tubules (ferritin-H, responsible for iron storage and ferroportin, responsible for iron removal from cells) and established protocols for iron supplementation, restriction, and conservative therapeutic chelation. Successful completion of this work is expected to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of intracellular iron regulation in the kidney, which are critical for kidney fibrosis propagation and will identify approaches capable of influencing cellular catalytic iron as a novel therapeutic target. Thus, the proposed work addresses a critical lack of knowledge essential for the development of new therapeutic approaches to iron homeostasis, which are on the critical path to halting CKD progression in patients."

11174026,"The vestibular system is crucial for postural control and the perception of head and body
movement in space. Older adults and those with neurodegenerative disease often are affected
disproportionately by cognitive decline and poor vestibular function. These groups are also at risk
for increased falls and early death. In the US, these populations are predicted to nearly triple to
~14 million by 2060. Symptoms of vestibular dysfunction, such as dizziness, vertigo, and postural
instability, can arise from damage to the vestibular system's peripheral or central components.
Studies suggest that loud noise can produce vestibular nerve hypofunction, manifesting as a
reduction in the amplitude of P1 of vestibular short latency evoked potentials (VsEPs). Using this
model, morphological and functional changes have been identified in peripheral vestibular organs.
However, the role of the brain in noise-induced bilateral vestibular nerve dysfunction is not well
understood. Knowledge of underlying mechanisms related to this relationship is necessary for
addressing the predicted significant increase in ""fall risk"" populations and is vital for preventing
their premature deaths. Therefore, we will assess in vivo changes in central neuronal activation
(MEMRI and c-Fos), changes in molecular indicators of synaptic transmission at central afferent
synapses (CaBPs, vGluTs, and CaVs), and motor function (i.e., skilled walking) in response to
vestibular nerve hypofunction generated by noise exposure. Evaluating the contributions of
irregular fibers to neuronal activation in the vestibular nuclear complex and cerebellum and
determining how these contributions change over time after noise-induced vestibular nerve
hypofunction will ultimately provide both a treatment window and targets for intervention."
11133670,"Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)-based therapeutics have profound effects on body weight and blood glucose management. GLP-1 cells are located in both the periphery and the caudal medulla, specifically within the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). However, the effects of GLP-1 or long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP1Rags) on synaptic/cellular properties in the brain and their contribution to metabolic changes are not entirely understood. Based on pilot data, we hypothesize that a DMH GLP-1R → NPY/AgRP neuron circuit is a target for brain-derived GLP-1 neurons and GLP-1Rags. Our objective is to determine if DMH GLP-1R neurons are required for the NTS GLP-1-induced effects on NPY/AgRP activity and metabolism. The project will use 
chemogenetics, electrophysiology, and in-vivo calcium imaging to investigate these questions. These experiments will potentially bridge our understanding of the regulation and physiological roles of the GLP-1system in the brain and in the treatment of metabolic disease. 
Glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1Rags) have profound anti-diabetic and antiobesity effects, but the neural systems responsible for mediating these effects are not fully understood. The endogenous function of brain-derived GLP-1, located in the Nucleus Tractus Solitarius (NTS), may provide insight into the effects of GLP-1Rags in the brain. In particular, NTS GLP-1 neurons target multiple brain regions and reduce food intake and glucose production upon activation, which is similar to the effects of GLP-1Rags. While NTS GLP-1 neurons do not express GLP-1receptors, GLP-1Rags may activate target nuclei downstream of NTS GLP-1 neurons that do express GLP-1Rs, thereby mimicking the effects of stimulating NTS GLP-1 neurons. We hypothesize one component of the beneficial effects of both NTS GLP-1 and GLP-1Rags on metabolism involves an NTS GLP-1 neuron → dorsal medial nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMH) GABAergic neuron → Arcuate nucleus circuit that ultimately reduces Neuropeptide Y/Agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neuron activity. This study aims to define this NTS → DMH → arcuate circuit and determine if GLP-1Rags and central GLP-1 converge on the DMH to inhibit NPY/AgRP neurons and improve metabolism. Previous work and preliminary data demonstrate that: 1) GLP1-Rags decrease the excitability of NPY/AgRP neurons, 2) a GABAergic neuron that expresses GLP-1Rs and leptin receptors (LepRs) resides in the DMH, 3) DMH GLP-1R+ and LepR+ neurons are activated by GLP-1Rags, food presentation/intake, and/or elevated glucose levels, and 4) there is synchrony in the regulation of activity of these neurons. Specifically, when NTS GLP-1 or DMH LepR+/GLP-1R+ neurons are activated, NPY/AgRP neurons are inhibited. These findings suggest the NTS GLP-1 → DMH GLP-1R/LepR → NPY/AgRP circuit functions as a convergence point for satiety signals. We aim to investigate the role of DMH GLP-1R+ neurons in mediating the effects of GLP-1Rags and NTS GLP-1 neuron activity, as well as explore how this circuit affects NPY/AgRP neuron activity and metabolism. The proposed model (Figure 1) predicts that activation of DMH GLP-1R neurons by GLP-1Rags or by NTS GLP-1 neuronal projections (e.g. in response to a meal or in response to exercise) leads to increased GABA release from DMH GLP-1R neurons and inhibition of NPY/AgRP activity. This, in turn, mediates various beneficial metabolic effects of central GLP-1 and GLP-1/Rags. The studies outlined below are designed to directly test the predictions.
Specific Aim – To determine if increased activity of NTS GLP-1 neurons alters DMH and arcuate NPY/AgRP neuron physiology and metabolism. We hypothesize that NTS GLP-1 neuron activation leads to inhibition of arcuate NPY/AgRP neurons through a GABAergic DMH interneuron that expresses GLP-1Rs and/or LepRs. We will utilize optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches to activate NTS GLP-1 neurons while simultaneously monitoring DMH GLP-1R+ or LepR+ neurons as well as arcuate NPY/AgRP neuron activity exvivo (electrophysiology) and in-vivo (calcium imaging).
Summary: The proposed studies link the GLP-1R agonist class of anti-obesity/anti-diabetes medications to a novel NTS GLP-1 → DMH GLP-1R/LepR → NPY/AgRP circuit. We will examine the requirement of GLP-1 neurotransmission and GLP-1R signaling in the plasticity of this circuit using patch clamp electrophysiology, invivo calcium imaging, and metabolic phenotyping with unique mouse models already in hand"
11133671,"Project Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) causes tuberculosis (TB), a serious lung disease that affects over one third
of the global population and results in ~1.5 million deaths every year. TB treatment includes a combination of
three or more anti-TB drugs over a prolonged period (6–9 months). In the last few decades, multidrug-resistant
TB and extensively drug resistant TB strains have emerged due to mismanaged use of anti-TB drugs, (e.g., not
completing the full course of the TB regimen, using the wrong dose or length of administration time, and/or the
use of poor-quality drugs). We propose that shortening the treatment period for clearance of M.tb would assist
to eradicate TB and preventing the development of drug resistance in active and latent TB. We discovered that,
the need for long treatment period is partly due to suppression of the host innate immune response by M.tb,
which involves the efflux of endogenous anti-microbial substances and administered TB drugs from host
macrophages. Specifically, when macrophages are infected with M.tb, expression of the macrophage drug efflux
pump MDR1 increases, resulting in various endogenous and exogenous chemical substances, including TB
drugs, being expelled from macrophages to benefit the survival of the bacteria. Thus, M.tb co-opts these host
pathways. Overall, the mission of my laboratory is to identify molecules in the host that will enable us to create
a novel host-directed therapy for TB. Toward that end, we were the first to discover the link between M.tb
pathogenesis and macrophage MDR1 expression and function during infection. Elevated MDR1 alters the
macrophage innate immune response and subsequent efflux of antimicrobials reduces the effectiveness of
macrophages M.tb killing. We hypothesize that M.tb-dependent upregulation of MDR1 expression in human
macrophages is mediated by heat shock factor protein 1 (HSF1). The aims of the proposed research are to 1)
Define the role of MDR1 in M.tb survival in macrophages; 2) Determine whether HSF1 activation or MDR1
inhibition shortens the sterilization period of M.tb by TB drugs; and 3) Identification of endogenous antimicrobials
produced by macrophages in response to M.tb infection. We will use human monocyte-derived macrophages,
biochemical and genetic techniques, and a mouse model to accomplish our aims. Our basic research discoveries
will jump-start the development of new drugs to treat tuberculosis."
11174971,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
4D transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) offers an excellent means to study complex heart anatomy and
measure cardiac dynamics via myocardial strain imaging. While TTE-based 4D strain imaging overcomes many
shortcomings of traditional strain analysis, and modern speckle-tracking algorithms enhanced reproducibility, 4D
echocardiography currently lacks the necessary spatial and temporal resolution for comprehensive flow analysis.
Likewise, modern systems do not still allow the user to adjust the number and location of the acquired planes,
which is crucial for assessing heart valves and cardiac fluid dynamics enabled by echocardiographic particle
image velocimetry (Echo-PIV). There is an unmet clinical need to study 4D flow fields in heart chambers,
especially in the right ventricle (RV) via echocardiography, which is ubiquitous, real-time, and less expensive
than cardiac MRI (CMR). The significance of 4D flow information in the RV and how it alters clinical diagnosis
and therapy has been recently illuminated. To date, no breakthrough in transducer technology has yet evolved
to offer selective control over 3D spatial information acquired about tissue strain and complex flow.
Our team’s multidisciplinary expertise in hardware, software, and clinical ultrasound supports our overarching
goal to develop a novel generation of broadband echocardiography transducers, which uniquely utilize only the
elements around a matrix array periphery. Combined with multi-line transmit focusing and coherence-based
receive beamforming methods, they will provide volume rates substantially higher than existing systems. Not
available on commercial systems, the combined advantages of broadband capability, high-speed volume
acquisition, and user-adjustable multiplanar acquisition will enable rapid 4D strain imaging and enhance
detection, tracking, and visualization of microbubbles for 4D flow measurements.
Combining both labs’ complementary expertise will devise a novel generation of 4D TTE ultrasound systems
using matrix arrays with a beamformer to enable operator-controlled multiplanar acquisition at high volume-rates.
SPECIFIC AIM 1. Develop a novel generation of 4D TTE probes with broadband multi-row/multi-column
boundary array that will enable high-speed adjustable multi-planar acquisition.
SPECIFIC AIM 2. Devise multi-line transmit-focusing and coherence-based receive beamforming
methods.
SPECIFIC AIM 3. Validate 4D TTE system in vitro and clinically by enabling MP-Echo-PIV and
multiplanar strain imaging."
11174973,"This proposal addresses the unmet need that the mechanisms governing in vivo chemical changes of total
knee arthroplasty (TKA) tibial liners are not known. Our objective is to determine the in vivo chemical alteration
processes of contemporary ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (PE) tibial liners, their impact on
mechanical and wear behavior, and enhance preclinical methods to predict particle-induced osteolysis in TKA.
The proposed work is significant because understanding how PE changes in the body is essential to
understand long-term PE degradation processes and open new pathways for technology to maximize implant
longevity. This research marks an essential step toward our long-term goal of achieving a lifetime TKA—
independent of patient age. Our central hypothesis is that initial PE structure, implant design, and the chemical
periprosthetic environment drive in vivo oxidation, mechanical properties, wear, and thereby the onset of
osteolysis. We base our hypothesis and approach on our preliminary data of TKA wear assessment, validated
FEA-based wear simulation, chemical and mechanical characterization of PE, and FTIR imaging (FTIR-I)
augmented histopathological analysis. We will test our hypothesis with three Specific Aims. Aim 1. To
determine PE mechanical in vivo changes and their impact on TKA long-term wear behavior and damage
progression. Working Hypothesis: The initial PE structure and tibial liner design drive the rate, quantity, and
spatial distribution of in vivo mechanical properties changes. We will test the hypothesis using retrieval
analysis, bench tests, and FEA which simulates tibial liner wear and damage after oxidation-induced
mechanical properties changes. Aim 2. To determine the onset and progression of late osteolysis in
contemporary TKA in a large retrieval cohort by means of FTIR-I augmented histopathological evaluation.
Working hypothesis: osteolysis onset and progression will be prevalent in otherwise well-functioning TKAs as
seen by radiolucencies and FTIR-I augmented histopathological markers within periprosthetic tissue at 12-15
years in situ. Aim 3. To determine PE chemical in vivo changes and the impact of the local periprosthetic
environment. Working hypothesis: Competitive absorption of pro-/anti-oxidative constituents from the
periprosthetic environment accelerates PE oxidation and changes in mechanical/tribological properties. A
novel FEA model will be used to simulate competitive absorption, verified with FTIR-I/Raman scans of
retrieved liners. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on the relationship between oxidation,
in vivo exposure of tibial liners to pro- and anti-oxidative species, in vivo loading, and the relationship to PE
type (dose and thermal treatment). It will also investigate new techniques for identifying PE within
periprosthetic tissues. This new and substantively different approach will open new horizons to minimize in vivo
PE oxidation, diagnose PE-induced inflammatory responses, and predict implant longevity."

Metabolic health issues such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and type 2 diabetes melilotus (T2DM) are risks for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal cancer (CRC). Emerging evidence has revealed that diet-induced gut dysbiosis contributes to metabolic disease development, including cancer. Thus, gut dysbiosis-targeted drug discovery should be explored, which is anticipated to advance the field of metabolic disease prevention and treatment. This project aims to develop and characterize an orally delivered nanodrug designed and synthesized to compensate for the shortage of specific microbial metabolite-regulated signaling in liver and colon cancer patients. The metabolic benefits of this novel drug have been uncovered in diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse models. 
Our data shows that human CRC and HCC specimens have elevated protein deacetylases and reduced signaling for short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), harboring histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitory properties. Through epigenetic mechanisms, HDAC inhibitors enhance intestinal retinoic acid (RA) signaling, which is consistently reduced in human HCC and CRC. We have validated the interactive and combined benefits of HDAC inhibitors and RA in cancer cells and animal models. We, therefore, have synthesized nano- “RA-based HDAC inhibitors” using polymers. One of the synthesized drugs, PRORA, was produced by covalently linking propionic acid (PRO), an HDAC inhibitor, and all-trans RA (RA) to polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), assembled into nano-micelles. This nano-formulation allows the co-delivery of both chemicals simultaneously. PRORA can be absorbed by the intestinal epithelial cells. In DIO mice, oral therapy with PRORA reverses diet-induced fatty liver, splenomegaly, and insulin resistance without noticeable toxicity. Based on this exciting success, we propose to uncover the mechanisms of action. Our data revealed that PRORA activated hepatic and intestinal FXR, a bile acid (BA) receptor, which also has reduced expression in human HCC and CRC. We propose analyzing the effects of PRORA in FXR-dependent or -independent manners using DIO wild-type mice and FXR KO mice, followed by transcriptomic profiling using colon and liver RNA. PRORA-influenced genes and pathways will be uncovered in the gut-liver axis. In addition, because FXR KO mice are prone to developing MASH and progressing into liver cancer, the proposed approaches allow us to determine whether PRORA has liver cancer-preventive effects. The data generated impact on having a safe orally delivered drug to treat or prevent MASH and T2DM."

The Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB) is the authoritative worldwide resource that provides free access to the wealth of information on biomolecules derived from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These NMR experimental data underlie the three-dimensional structures and conformations of many proteins and nucleic acids and provide important insights into their dynamics, chemical properties, and molecular interactions. NMR is also useful for characterizing biomolecular interactions, with applications to drug discovery, and in quantifying the components of complex mixtures of biomolecules, including metabolites and natural products. Data archived at BMRB include chemical shifts, peak intensities, scalar couplings, dipolar couplings, and relaxation and cross-relaxation rates. BMRB integrates these NMR data into a unified, global, molecular database of general utility to the broad scientific community. The growing volume of data available from BMRB is catalyzing transformative scientific applications, such as the determination of protein structure and dynamics directly from chemical shifts. BMRB maintains software tools for integrating the retrieval, analysis, and display of NMR data in the context of molecular structure and conformation. As a member of the World Wide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB), BMRB has close ties with the other wwPDB partners: the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB), the Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe), the Electron Microscopy Data Base (EMDB), and the Protein Data Bank of Japan (PDBj). In its role in the wwPDB, BMRB implements standards for NMR data types and maintains software for data deposition and validation. This project supports ongoing operation of BMRB, including maintenance of deposition pipelines and infrastructure to support search and retrieval of NMR data, and to maintain a productive dialogue with users and creators of biomolecular NMR data to increase the impact of the archive, and to maintain BMRB’s role in the wwPDB."
11021541,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. In the Unites States, an estimated 151,300 Americans will be diagnosed with CRC and over 52,580 are expected to die from the disease in 2022 alone (https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/colorect.html). While the five-year survival rate for localized CRC is excellent at 90%, more than half of new CRC cases have the disease spread to regional lymph nodes and/or distant organs at the time of diagnosis. CRC with distant metastasis has a dismal five-year survival rate of 14.7%. These data clearly indicate that CRC-related mortality can be significantly improved if the disease is detected early and proper interventions could be deployed. Because CRC typically originates from precancerous colorectal polyps, routine colonoscopy screening provides an excellent opportunity to detect precursor or early lesions and reduce CRC-related morbidity and mortality. Indeed, the US Preventive Services Task Force recently updated its recommendation on CRC screening, noting the evidence that the screening in average-risk asymptomatic adults aged 50 to 75 years is of substantial benefit. Risk factors for CRC include age (>50), race (African American), obesity, cigarette smoking, type II diabetes, history of inflammatory bowel diseases, family history of colorectal polyps or CRC, and inherited genetic syndromes known to increase the CRC risks, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome. FAP and Lynch syndrome are caused by germline mutations in the APC gene and DNA mismatch repair genes, respectively. The management of individuals with hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes requires additional measures beyond what is recommended for the average-risk population to minimize the overall risk of cancer-associated morbidity and mortality. Management options for the confirmed mutation carriers include multiple aggressive screening, chemopreventive strategies, and prophylactic surgery. However, these interventions are associated with various degrees of adverse effects. Safer and more effective preventive measures are urgently needed for the individuals with FAP, Lynch syndrome, and other hereditary gastrointestinal cancer syndromes. Fusobacteria are common human oral gram-negative anaerobic microflora isolated from dental plaque and gum diseases, but rarely detectable in the colorectum of healthy individuals. In recent years, the enrichment of a specific pathotype, Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn), has been demonstrated in the colonic tissues and stools from patients with colorectal adenomas and CRC. Clinical evidence suggests that the prevalence of Fn progressively increases from dysplasia, adenomas to CRC and the higher amount of Fn is significantly associated with CRC with high microsatellite instability, which is caused by DNA MMR deficiencies as seen in Lynch syndrome-associated CRC. The potential association of Fn with CRC tumorigenesis has been examined in a mouse model of FAP. ApcMin/+ mice, which carry a nonsense mutation at codon 850 of the Apc gene, had a significantly accelerated onset and increased multiplicity of both small intestinal and colorectal tumors after oral inoculation of Fn. These data strongly suggested the tumor-promoting role of Fn in ApcMin/+ mice. Interestingly, Fn did not induce colitis in these animals, in contrast to enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, which has been shown to cause colitis and accelerate tumorigenesis in ApcMin/+ mice. It has also been demonstrated that Fn promotes CRC, breast, and cervical cancer metastasis and can metastasizes with tumor cells. Although how Fn contributes to CRC tumorigenesis has yet to be fully elucidated, emerging evidence points to its virulence factors, such as FadA and Fap2, as potential enhancers of CRC tumorigenesis and progression. The Fap2 has been shown to bind to human T-cell immunoglobulin ITIM domain (TIGIT), an immunoglobulin superfamily receptor known to function as an immune co-inhibitory molecule. Fap2-binding to TIGIT on NK and other T cells protects tumor cells from NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and blocks effector T cell functions in the tumor microenvironment. TIGIT has also been shown to promote Treg function. Taken together, Fn may exert tumor promoting effects not only by promoting CRC tumor growth, but also by exploiting the immune-suppressive function of TIGIT via its virulence factor protein and contributing to tumor immune evasion mechanisms. Cancers caused by infectious agents are theoretically preventable, if one can prevent the infection, eradicate oncogenic pathogens before tumor development, or suppress the functions of oncogenic molecules. Prophylactic vaccines for human papillomavirus and hepatitis B virus have been associated with significant reductions in infection rates, which are expected to result in the dramatic decrease in the incidence of cervical cancers and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. Compared to the prevention of infection, the eradication of oncogenic infectious agents already colonized in the host is in general highly challenging, if not impossible. For example, the well-established eradication regimens for Helicobacter pylori, which increases the risk of noncardia gastric cancers, do not eradicate the bacteria in all cases. Rather, emerging resistance to multiple antibiotics appears to be contributing to the recent decline in the eradication rate. Alternatively, the host immune defense system may be fortified by pathogen-targeted vaccines, if they can boost anti-pathogen immunity and lead to the containment of infection or suppression of pathogen-mediated tumorigenic functions. Fn is a gram-negative anaerobic bacillus, and can be isolated from 60-70% of children aged 5-7 years. As with other gram-negative bacteria, Fn produces outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), which contain much of the biological content of the Fn, but without replicative capacity and some of the soluble proteins found in OMVs may elicit anti-Fn immunity. As part of the PREVENT project to develop Fn OMV based anti-Fn vaccine (https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/9358850), the proteomic characterization of Fn OMV led to the identification of putative immunogenic components, some of which may be useful as anti-Fn vaccine antigens. Lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated mRNA vaccines against COVID-19 revolutionized the implementation of mRNA-based vaccinology. In addition to modifications of mRNA such as with pseudouridine incorporation to reduce innate immune responses and mRNA purification methodologies to remove contaminants, the development of biocompatible LNPs significantly boosted the advancement of COVID and other mRNA-based vaccines. LNP-RNA vaccine platform offers several advantages over conventional protein-based vaccination, including a rapid development, refined adjustment of antigenic epitopes, easier scale-up and timely deployment. The the current study aims to develop and evaluate the immunogenicity of soluble protein-based and LNP-RNA-based Fn vaccines and to determine anti-Fn activity and immunopreventive efficacy of Fn-associated CRC, using mouse models of FAP and Lynch syndrome."

Background
Cancer cachexia (CC) is a systemic, metabolic wasting syndrome featuring body weight loss due to
skeletal muscle and adipose tissue wasting. CC is suffered by ~80% of cancer patients that causes
reduced performance status, intolerance to chemotherapy, and increased mortality. This debilitating
condition is poorly understood and has no effective treatment. If CC therapy existed, it would
improve treatment responses, increase quality of life, and prolong survival. With 50 years of study,
the field has focused on defining pathways that promote atrophy in the end-organs most affected my
cachexia. While this work has been fruitful, it has not led to identification of the upstream mediators
of CC, nor has it generated effective therapies. There is an urgent need for high-quality discovery
science and more detailed clinical phenotyping.We have created a virtual institute comprised of
diverse, international, multidisciplinary scientists and clinicians with expertise in cancer, metabolism,
neuroendocrine function, immunology, human metabolic diseases, preclinical models, and clinical
phenotyping. We hypothesize that CC is driven by tumor-intrinsic factors that activate neurohormonal
sickness pathways, which then induce anorexia, metabolic dysfunction, and tissue atrophy.
Aims
Project 1 - Identification of cancer-induced systemic metabolic dysregulation.
Project 2 - Determination of tumor-immune drivers of cachexia.
Project 3 - Defining the neuroendocrine response to cancer.
Project 4 - Identification of clinical cachexia subtypes.
Methods
Our approach involves sophisticated measures of host-tumor interactions including innovative
investigation of (1) systemic metabolic flux in mice using isotope tracing, imaging mass spectroscopy,
dynamic nuclear imaging, and dietary and pharmacologic interventions; (2) cellular components and
secreted factors from the tumor microenvironment using imaging mass cytometry, patient-derived
organoid xenografts, microbial toxins, and CRISPR-based manipulations; (3) central pathways
regulating appetite, behavior, and peripheral organ metabolism using human metabolic phenotyping,
optogenetic, and pharmacological methods. We will perform the largest, most comprehensive
observational study in CC subjects to thoroughly define CC subtypes and their clinical biomarkers
using epidemiologic tools, novel image segmentation algorithms, and cluster analyses."
10990819,"The objective of this project is to develop an easily accessible MRI-based cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen
consumption (CMRO2) mapping for evaluating ischemic lesion viability in acute stroke patients. Because about
90% of the brain's energy comes from oxidative phosphorylation, mapping CMRO2 holds great promise in
managing various neurological diseases. In ischemia, CMRO2, equal to oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) times
cerebral blood flow (CBF) scaled by arterial oxygen concentration, is the best predictor of reversible or
irreversible brain tissue damage (penumbra or infarction) with the CMRO2 reduction reflecting the rate of
transition to infarction, which would inform critical therapeutic decisions. While CBF is routinely mapped in MRI,
CT and PET, current standard for OEF mapping is 15O PET using three radioligands (O[15O], H2[15O] and
C[15O]). Extremely demanding radiochemical processes due to 15O's short 2-minute half-life make 15O PET
only available at very few sites. This inability to perform OEF mapping in clinical settings has resulted in
clinicians using suboptimal surrogate biomarkers of brain tissue viability such as CBF or diffusion-weighted
imaging (DWI) that are known to overestimate penumbra. We propose to develop accurate MRI-based OEF
using multiscale modeling approach and then CMRO2 by multiplying CBF from arterial spin labeling, validate
MRI against 15O PET for CMRO2 in stroke patients with acute ischemic lesions, and compare MRI based
CMRO2 vs diffusion/perfusion mismatch for prediction of final infarct volume in patients with acute ischemic
stroke. Our proposal will validate MRI-based CMRO2 as a tool to assess tissue viability in acute and chronic
ischemic lesions. This will allow CMRO2 mapping to be performed routinely in clinical settings and will enable
vital cerebral oxygen metabolic imaging in clinical decision-making for managing patients with acute ischemic
stroke and advanced atherosclerotic diseases."
11170076,"Deafness and blindness are two of the most common and most devastating neurological disorders. Seldom
fatal, they separate patients from the world they live in and the people they love, for a lifetime. In many cases,
combined deafness and blindness result from a single gene defect, usually with a mutant gene copy inherited
from both parents. Usher syndrome is a devastating hereditary deafness and blindness caused by mutation of
any of nine genes. One gene, PCDH15, when mutated, causes Usher syndrome type 1F, manifesting as
profound congenital deafness, balance disorder and progressive blindness. There is no treatment. New
methods are rapidly being developed for gene therapy to treat monogenic disorders, methods that change
patient lives. Here, we propose to develop a gene therapy strategy for Usher Syndrome Type 1F and to initiate
its path to the clinic to treat different pathologies of the disease.
Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors have been found to be efficient and effective for gene therapy in the
inner ear and their application in development of gene addition therapies to treat Usher syndrome type 1F is an
attractive approach. However, the PCDH15 coding sequence of almost 6 kb is too large to fit in AAV, which
has a capacity of ~4.7 kb. Most of PCDH15 resembles a “bead chain” structure of 11 beads, with binding
domains at N- and C-terminal ends. We have developed novel “mini-PCDH15” constructs that retain the
binding domains but lack 4-5 beads, and that consequently fit in AAV vectors. They show normal binding in
vitro; at least two rescue hearing in our Pcdh15-knockout mouse model. We will use these and new mini-
PCDH15 constructs to rescue hearing and vestibular function in Pcdh15-knockout mice. We will also employ in
silico and in vitro structural biology and protein chemistry to carefully characterize each successful mini-
PCDH15, and use that for iterative optimization of engineered mini-PCDH15s. Finally, we will test the best
performing mini-PCDH15 for localization and toxicity in non-human primate ear as part of their preclinical
evaluation.
Because mechanical stress on PCDH15 is greater in the inner ear than in the eye, the engineered mini-
PCDH15 constructs that successfully rescue hearing or balance will also have the potential to halt or even
reverse the progressive vision loss in patients. In addition, methods we develop in this study using a rational,
iterative, structure-based mini-gene approach to develop Usher 1F therapy will be applicable to many other
deafness genes with coding sequences that do not fit in AAV."
11171002,"Understanding immune responses that contribute to severe COVID-19 is essential to identify patients likely to
become critically ill and to discern which pathways to target for therapeutic intervention. The inflammasome is
an antiviral and proinflammatory pathway activated by many viruses, but its role in COVID-19 has not been
defined fully. Inflammasome activation results in an inflammatory type of cell death called pyroptosis as well as
the release of proinflammatory cytokines that include interleukin (IL)-18. Inflammasome cytokines are central to
viral control, but excessive or prolonged activation enhances pathogenesis of numerous respiratory virus
infections, including avian influenza and SARS-CoV-1. Having extensively studied the role of inflammasome
cytokines in the pathogenesis of multiple other viral infections, we measured IL-18 and 36 other cytokines and
chemokines in plasma from patients with COVID-19. While most were not significantly different in COVID-19,
IL-18 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA) levels are elevated in intubated patients with COVID-19 versus non-
intubated COVID-19 and hospitalized influenza patients. Incubation of human macrophages with SARS-CoV-2
in vitro produced IL-18, IL-1, IL-RA, IL-6, and IL-8. We used a human macrophage cell-line with various
inflammasome genes disrupted to show that caspase-1 and NLRP3 are required for SARS-CoV-2 activation of
the inflammasome. We will establish the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 activates the inflammasome and
determine how inhibition of this pathway alters innate immune signaling using a panel of endocytosis inhibitors,
macrophage cell lines with specific inflammasome and other innate sensing genes disrupted, and specific
inhibitors of innate sensing in primary human macrophages. Early investigations suggest that antibodies (Abs)
modulate innate sensing of SARS-CoV-2. To test whether Abs produced during COVID-19 alter innate
signaling, we will incubate SARS-CoV-2 with monoclonal Abs or patient sera, inoculate primary or immortalized
macrophages, and measure supernatant cytokines. To investigate cellular function, we developed a flow
cytometry-based platform that enables single cell analysis of traditional cell surface markers combined with
intracellular staining for proteins involved in metabolic programming. Using this platform, we identified myeloid
derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) with distinct metabolic profiles that correlated with severe COVID-19.
Prolonged inflammation induces MDSCs in cancer, obesity, and chronic infections. We will use single cell RNA
sequencing to characterize these novel MDSCs and assess how cytokines produced in COVID-19 regulate
MDSC metabolic programming. The overall goal is to define the mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 activates
inflammatory pathways, Ab modulation, the role of MDSCs, and how they intersect to mediate SARS-CoV-2
immune control and pathology. This will identify targets for therapeutic intervention that minimize inflammatory
pathology without impairing antiviral immunity as the foundation of novel clinical trials and markers of disease
progression that allow targeting resources to patients most likely to experience severe disease."
11171003,"The metabolic activity of immune cells is tightly linked to their function. We have been developing a flow
cytometry based platform that enables single cell analysis of traditional cell surface markers combined with
intracellular staining for proteins involved in metabolic programming. The intracellular proteins include carnitine
palmitoyltransferase Ia (CPT1a), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria,
proteins involved in glycolysis such as hexokinase II, and the mitochondrial membrane protein voltage-
dependent anion channel (VDAC). Intracellular staining also detects histone methylation markers. While this
approach was originally developed to predict and track responses to immunotherapy for cancer, we have
recently applied this technology to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from COVID-19 patients. By
interrogating immune-metabolic programs we have defined three distinct and novel populations of immune
cells in the PBMC of COVID-19 patients: He3K27me3+VDAC+ T cells; Hexokinase II+ Granulocytic Myeloid
Derived Suppressor Cells; and CPT1a+VDAC+DR- monocytic MDSC. By interrogating PBMC from SARS-
CoV-2 infected patients, we seek to define novel biomarkers in order to predict severity of disease and track
the course of disease and to define novel surrogate markers for testing therapeutic regimens and identifying
novel therapeutic targets. Furthermore, we will interrogate these three novel cell types as a means of better
understanding the nature of protective and pathogenic COVID-19 immune responses. Specifically, RP1 will
leverage these unique findings to better understand the role of these myeloid cells in innate immunity in SARS-
CoV-2 infection, while this project, RP2, will specifically examine the T cell responses. Indeed, the unique
population of H3K27me3+VDAC+ T cells appear to be exquisitely sensitive to apoptosis, which is prevented by
the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD as well as the VDAC inhibitor VBIT-4. To understand the impact of this
population on antiviral immunity, we will investigate whether these T cells are specific for SARS-CoV-2 and
suggest destruction or dysfunction of viral antigen-specific T cells disproportionately. To address this, we have
developed a unique and powerful assay, the functional expansion of specific T cells (FEST) assay that
identifies antigen-specific T cell clonotypes using a T cell receptor sequencing (TCRseq)-based platform. By
combining the FEST assay, which was originally developed to track tumor reactive T cells in cancer patients,
with flow cytometry and TCRseq, we will determine if SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells are uniquely detected in T
cell populations with increased levels of metabolic markers. The completion of these studies will yield a novel
assay that will enable us to predict the severity and track the outcome of the disease course, develop a novel
biomarker for the testing of therapeutic regimens, provide fundamental insight into the pathogenesis of immune
dysfunction, and potentially provide insight and a means for developing novel immune-metabolic based drug
regimens."
11171023,"Abstract:
The proposed Sample Procurement and Clinical Core (SPCC; Core 1) has been designed to provide a unified,
comprehensive, and centralized service for collecting patient samples (both retained clinical specimens and
prospectively collected blood samples) to support the studies of Projects 1-3 and Core 2. The SPCC is an
outgrowth of similar (unfunded) activities initiated, optimized, and expanded beginning in February 2020, at
beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The SPCC will coordinate IRB applications, study participant recruitment,
sample procurement (including operationalizing blood collections by hospital phlebotomists to reduce
venipunctures per patient and PPE use), sample processing, and sample distribution to Projects 1-3 and Core
2. SPCC activities will be performed by regulatory specialists, clinical investigators (from rheumatology,
oncology, hematology, and infectious diseases), clinical pathologists, nurse-coordinators, and trained
technicians. This group’s efforts will be coordinated through regular meetings between leadership of the 3
Projects, Core 2, and the Administrative Core. The SPCC activities will achieve the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1: To extend our existing retained clinical sample repository to support prospective serosurveillance for the
 target populations of this Program. The SPCC will expand our existing retained sample repository by
 specifically targeting samples from patients of interest to this Program (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus
 [SLE]). The resulting longitudinal biorepository will support detailed serial serosurveillance studies by Core 2.
Aim 2: To coordinate all regulatory, recruitment, sample procurement, processing, distribution, and storage
 activities for prospective blood collections required for Projects 1-3. SPCC investigators will maintain
 comprehensive IRB approval(s) for prospective collection of clinical samples. They will closely collaborate
 with investigators from all Projects to consolidate sample needs, and develop a schedule for efficient sample
 collections to meet the needs of Projects 1-3. Staff will coordinate collections, assign sample study numbers,
 aliquot and label samples, and then either distribute to investigators from individual Projects or store frozen
 until needed. Samples and patient metadata will be entered into a secure RedCap database.
This Core allows U54 investigators to take optimal advantage of unique strengths at Emory including large
populations of rheumatology, multiple myeloma, and lung cancer patients, as well as large percentages of
African-Americans in these groups. Additionally, this Core facilitates patient enrollment at all 6 distinct hospital
sites and affiliated institutions (eg, Grady Memorial Hospital). Core staff will maintain a comprehensive RedCap
database on each patient, including metadata and test results, which will be invaluable for later data mining."
11170827,"PROJECT SUMMARY
With increasing life expectancy of US population, healthcare systems are faced with the challenge of improving
the health of older adults while containing healthcare costs. The health outcomes and healthcare costs of older
adults are significantly influenced by multimorbidity, frailty, and poor social determinants of health. There is an
increasing effort to shift disease-based care toward patient-centered care that addresses patients' medical and
psychosocial needs and enhances care coordination. To this end, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services
introduced Transitional Care Management (TCM) in 2013 and Chronic Care Management (CCM) services in
2015. Despite the premise of these services, they are not delivered to patients who need these services most.
The objective of this proposed research is to narrow this practice gap by evaluating the effectiveness of TCM
and CCM and develop strategies to increase adoption of these services. The central hypothesis of this project
is that TCM and CCM services are more effective in increasing days at home (home time), survival, and reducing
total Medicare costs than usual care in older adults, particularly those with frailty, dementia, and poor social
determinants of health; the uptake of these services is affected by patient-level, caregiver-level, and practice-
level factors. A team of experts in geriatrics, health services research, causal inference, health economics, and
qualitative research will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) determine the effectiveness of TCM and CCM
on home time, survival, and healthcare costs by emulating target trials of TCM and CCM in Medicare fee-for-
service and Medicare Advantage beneficiaries; 2) develop and validate prediction models to identify patients
who are more likely to benefit from TCM and CCM; and 3) identify patient-level, caregiver-level, and practice-
level facilitators and barriers in adopting TCM and CCM by conducting a large, multiregional qualitative study of
30 practices of high-volume, low-volume, and former use of TCM and CCM. The innovation of this research
includes its target trial emulation approach to evaluate the effectiveness of TCM and CCM compared with usual
care; use of patient-centered outcome home time; inclusion of contemporary Medicare fee-for-service and
Medicare Advantage beneficiaries; and mixed methods approach of conducting a multi-regional qualitative study
informed by a quantitative analysis of the national Medicare data. This research is significant because the results
can inform development of strategies to increase clinical adoption of TCM and CCM services in beneficiaries
who are most likely to benefit from each service. Ultimately, appropriate use of TCM and CCM will enhance
patient-centered coordinated care and reduce healthcare costs in aging populations."

11174987,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Understanding the mechanism behind cellular activities requires large-scale mining of genetic and transcriptomic
observations from large amounts of human data. Widespread and easy access to such data is imperative to
make biological connections between genes and diseases. However, there is a direct conflict between protecting
the privacy of patients and research participants and broad sharing of genetic and transcriptomic data for
biomedical advances. In order to address these privacy concerns during transcriptomic analysis, we propose to
take advantage of cryptographic approaches that enable direct computations on encrypted data without revealing
the sensitive information in them. We will create an evolving and modular tool suite to preserve privacy; this suite
will have the ability to be adopted to new data modalities and analysis needs as they arise. In particular, we
propose to develop a series of tools that can quantify the bulk transcript and single-cell gene expression and
perform eQTL mapping on the encrypted genotypes in a shared server and cloud setting. The proposed tools
will help prevent future catastrophic privacy leaks, which may result in a loss of access to all medically actionable
data. Our long-term goal is to democratize data access for all researchers and create trust between patients and
researchers, thus increasing participation in studies."
11173939,"SUMMARY
The goal of our project is to understand the structural features guiding the initial stages of pre-mRNA splice site
recognition, which are critical for accurate pre-mRNA splicing and frequently dysregulated in human diseases.
We focus on the U2AF, SF1 and SF3B1 splicing factors directing the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U2
snRNP) to the 3´ splice sites of pre-mRNAs. The U2AF subunits, U2AF2 and U2AF1, recognize the
polypyrimidine and AG-dinucleotide splice site signals. A third subunit, SF1 initially associates with the branch
point sequence of the pre-mRNA then is displaced by the SF3B1 subunit of the U2 snRNP. Dynamic
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of SF3B1 is required for formation of the active spliceosome. Previously,
we made progress towards understanding the molecular underpinnings of the initial steps of 3´ splice site
selection. Using X-ray crystallography, biophysical techniques, and functional assays for pre-mRNA splicing in
human cells, we have shown that representative cancer-associated mutations at the U2AF2 – RNA interface
disrupt RNA binding and splicing. We have deciphered structural details showing how U2AF2 accommodates
diverse nucleotides of splice site signals. By complementary single molecule Förster resonance energy transfer
approaches, we further revealed that the U2AF2 conformation changes in response to different splice site
sequences as well as the U2AF1 subunit and its recurrent cancer-associated mutation. We have established
important, functional interfaces of U2AF2 with SF1 and SF3B1 during pre-mRNA splicing in human cells and
discovered that phosphorylation strongly reduces SF3B1 binding to U2AF2. However, these provocative results
raise new questions. First, what are the effects of recurrent U2AF2 mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders
compared to those in cancers? Second, how is dynamic SF3B1 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
temporally regulated with U2AF2 dissociation prior to splicing? Third, how are the U2AF2, U2AF1, and SF1
subunits arranged to accurately recognize the splice site signals and ensure the fidelity of splicing? We address
these questions in the aims of this proposal by leveraging structural approaches (including X-ray crystallography,
cryoelectron microscopy, calorimetry, and fluorescence) and complementary functional assays (including co-
immunoprecipitations, pre-mRNA splicing assays, and transcriptome-wide sequencing). Altogether, the results
of these aims contribute to understanding the structural and functional underpinnings of 3´ splice site recognition
and its dysregulation in human disease."
11171004,"Research Project 3 Summary
There are insufficient data regarding the long-term humoral immune responses induced after SARS-CoV-2
infection. Our preliminary data indicate that there is variation in the magnitude and duration of antibody
responses following SARS-CoV-2 infection. While IgG and IgA antibodies against spike (S) and the receptor
binding domain of S (S-RBD) appear to remain constant over time, neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers wane and
are not detected in up to 25% of infected individuals who have detectable anti-S and anti-S-RBD antibodies.
We have also observed that during the convalescent phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, individuals with more
severe COVID-19 (i.e., hospitalized, older, and male patients) have significantly greater serological responses
to SARS-CoV-2. The antibody responses mediating protection from re-infection are not defined, and neither
are responses that may mediate greater pathology. From studies of other viruses, it is clear that a variety of
antibody functions contribute to protection from re-infection and modulate disease severity. Both nAbs and
non-nAbs can mediate a number of different activities, which include complement activation and antibody-
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which may contribute to pathogenesis as well as protections from
SARS-CoV-2. The overarching goal of JH-EPICS Research Project 3 is to analyze the magnitude and duration
of the total as well as functional antibody responses after SARS-CoV-2 infection. We have developed a core
set of serological assays to be applied to a prospective, demographically diverse cohort of hospitalized patients
presenting with mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease. Plasma samples have and will continue to be
collected at multiple timepoints from enrollment through one year post-enrollment. Aim 1 will systematically
evaluate antibody isotype switching and the subclasses and quality of the immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, and IgA
[monomeric and dimeric]) that recognize the SARS-CoV-2 S and S-RBD. Aim 2 will characterize the kinetics
and duration of the neutralizing antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 and the ability of viruses to escape
from nAbs. Finally, Aim 3 will analyze the function of non-neutralizing SARS-CoV-2-specific serological
response by assessing ADCC, complement-mediated cytotoxicity, and complement fixation activity toward
SARS-CoV-2 virus particles and virus-infected cells. Using linear regression analyses and modeling of these
data in the context of clinical and demographic information, we are uniquely positioned to determine the
modifiers that drive a protective antibody response following SARS-CoV-2 infection or, eventually, vaccination."
11171021,"PROJECT 2: ABSTRACT
Project 2 is based on evidence that lung cancer patients have higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and
increased risk of severe disease and mortality. This increased vulnerability is likely due to a combination of
factors, including immune-suppressing effects of the cancer itself or its treatment, age, pre-existing
comorbidities, or smoking. Moreover, the potential elevated levels of the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2
protein, in tumor and tumor-adjacent normal tissues observed in cancer patients and in lungs of tobacco smoking
individuals likely contributes to the susceptibility of these patients to SARS-CoV-2. Tumor cells are also known
to be more permissive to viral replication due to defects in innate antiviral immunity. The potential for increased
SARS-CoV-2 amplification in lung cancer cells might be a major factor contributing to enhanced COVID-19
disease in lung cancer patients. An increased susceptibility to viral infection and replication in lung cells in these
patients might also impact the ability of neutralizing antibodies to block viral replication, making lung cancer
patients more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and less able to become immune. Thus, a better
understanding of the factors that impact SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung cancer and normal lung cells is needed
for devising strategies to reduce the risk of lung cancer patients for severe COVID-19 disease, and for evaluation
of the protective efficacy of future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in these patients. To address these knowledge gaps,
in Aim 1 we will identify factors associated with the inter-individual variation in susceptibility to infection by SARS-
CoV-2 using an existing unique panel of human lung derived cancer and normal epithelial cells, and relate these
factors to key clinical, demographic, and molecular features. We will use a combination of virological and
genomics approaches, transcriptomics, and scRNAseq assays. The specificity of the susceptibility to SARS-
CoV-2 infection will be evaluated by comparison to other respiratory viruses, such as influenza viruses. In Aim
2, we will characterize the functional activity of antibodies and antivirals in susceptible lung cancer and normal
lung epithelial cells. Together with Project 1, we will determine the neutralizing potency of various antisera in
susceptible lung cancer cells versus non-cancer respiratory tissue, and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity
activities of antibodies in lung cancer versus normal lung epithelial cells. Lastly, we will determine the preclinical
activity of drugs under clinical trial consideration in lung cancer cells vs. non-cancer respiratory tissue. Successful
completion of these aims depend on our multi-disciplinary team, the clinical cohorts, biospecimens and resources
provided by the Clinical and Data Sciences Cores and coordinated with overall U54 activities by the
Administrative Core. In sum, these studies will provide new information on the determinants of the susceptibility
of lung cancer patients to SARS-CoV-2 infection and uncover potential new therapeutic strategies."
11170828,"Abstract: Stem cell exhaustion and related metabolic dysfunction are hallmarks of aging, compromising
tissue regeneration/renewal leading to eventual loss of tissue integrity and function. Understanding metabolic
programs necessary for proper stem cell function and aspects affected by age could open up therapeutic
targets. Our initial metabolomics analysis in the muscle stem cell (MuSC) identified glutamine metabolism as
a critical pathway during activation. Glutamine has multiple metabolic fates in mammalian cells. Aside from
direct incorporation into protein, glutamine can be metabolized to generate nucleotides, other amino acids,
and ATP via its anaplerotic metabolism in the TCA cycle in a “clockwise” direction. We have generated
preliminary data using stable isotope-enabled metabolic flux analysis to demonstrate that both glutamine-
driven oxidative and reductive or “counter-clockwise” pathways are active in muscle stem cells. Moreover, our
data suggest that these pathways are impaired in the aged cell, in part due to decreased glutaminase
expression. These preliminary findings lead to several new questions: 1- Is glutamine metabolism necessary
for stem cell function?, 2- What are the relative roles of oxidative and reductive pathways of glutamine
metabolism for energy generation and cell viability? And, 3-How does age alter glutamine metabolism, and
does restoration of these pathways restore cell function? We hypothesize that satellite cell function is
dependent on glutamine metabolism via both the oxidative pathway for energy production and the reductive
pathway, via isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2 (IDH1/2), for generation of NADPH to fuel the glutathione
redox pathway, ensuring redox homeostasis. Moreover, we hypothesize that impairment of these pathways
contribute to age-related muscle stem cell dysfunction, which is reversible by restoration of glutamine
metabolism. We will test these hypotheses through the following aims. Aim1 will test the hypothesis that
glutamine-driven “bidirectional” metabolism is necessary for muscle stem cell function and myogenesis. We
will use small molecule inhibitors of glutaminase and, as a specific manipulation of the reductive pathway,
IDH2, to test this hypothesis. Aim2 will test the hypothesis that glutamine metabolism is impaired in old
MuSCs, and that correction of this deficit, via viral or genetic glutaminase gain of function approaches,
restores MuSC function and regenerative capacity to aged muscle. Aim3 will test the hypothesis that
glutamine metabolism regulates MuSC resilience through maintenance of cell redox status and attenuating
oxidative stress. We will test if the glutamine-driven reductive pathway generates isocitrate/citrate to serve as
“stored” form of NADPH for the cytosolic glutathione redox mechanism. The proposed studies will fully test
the hypothesis that glutamine metabolism is critical for muscle stem cell function, and that both oxidative and
reductive TCA metabolism contribute to stem cell proliferation and survival. Moreover, given that the
pathway appears dysfunctional in aging stem cells, our studies will test it’s potential as a therapeutic target."

11173549,"Project Summary/Abstract
Conductive hearing loss in military personnel is commonly caused by blast-related middle ear injuries, which
can include tympanic membrane rupture and dislocation of the middle-ear ossicles. The current proposal seeks
to evaluate methods and devices for restoring hearing not only for active-duty military personnel and Veterans
who suffer from a blast-induced conductive hearing loss, but also for others who experience conductive
hearing loss for various reasons (e.g., ruptured eardrum, birth defects, stiffening of middle ear bones). While
these injuries are clinically treatable, the effects of middle-ear pathology on hearing are not well quantified, and
clinical outcomes often fail to completely restore normal hearing for those suffering from a conductive hearing
loss. The current proposal seeks to precisely measure the complex vibrational patterns along the ossicular
chain and related pressures at the ends of the middle ear system; the umbo attached to the tympanic
membrane and stapes attached to the cochlea, under both normal and particularly under various pathological
conditions (damaged/repaired/reconstructed using prosthesis). These studies will use Laser Doppler
Vibrometry, unique micro-pressure sensors and direct measures of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). Aim 1 will
evaluate the effects of systematically varied tympanic membrane perforations on middle ear sound
transmission in an animal model. The role of the tympanic membrane in sound transmission will be explored
and its influence on the motion of the ossicles will be characterized under varied perforation and naturally
healed conditions. Measurement of distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) following stimulation
with paired tones will be used to quantify the effect of varying degrees of damage to the tympanic membrane.
In Aim 2 we will measure sound transmission in an animal model with simulated ossicular chain pathologies. In
addition, the effect of an abnormal ossicular chain on the production and acoustic characteristics of DPOAEs
will be systematically explored in order to develop quantitative tools for diagnosing hearing loss and for use in
the design and implementation of improved methods of treatment. Aim 3 evaluates middle ear sound
transmission in human cadaver temporal bone models of clinically repaired human ears. Using direct pressure
and velocity measurements, the functional differences between normal middle ear structures and two currently
employed methods of repairing disarticulation of the middle ear ossicular chain, incus/stapes fixation or
partial/total ossicular chain replacement using prostheses, will be quantified in detail. The proposed research
will provide important information that will serve to improve our ability to specifically diagnose the causes of
conductive hearing loss, direct the development of improved methods of treatment, and assist in the rational
design of advanced prosthetics that more effectively restore hearing."

provide a critical missing element for personalized rehabilitation care in spatial neglect (SN), a
disabling cognitive deficit causing asymmetric 3-D spatial action, movement, perception and
awareness. For more than 10 years, the PI and colleagues addressed SN by extensively
characterizing neuropsychological deficits, documenting the adverse impact on function and
freedom, and developing feasible SN rehabilitation protocols. Their research reported ~80% SN
underdiagnosis and undertreatment; improving this care delivery gap is certain to reduce the
devastating personal and social losses associated with SN. Here, the PI moves from her past
work advancing dissemination, implementation, and rehabilitation to gain neuroimaging skills
and pursue a new, biological approach to improving SN care delivery. The PI and colleagues
discovered that the Aiming SN subtype, associated with motor-intentional deficits, predicts rapid
improvement of daily life function with early rehabilitation. However, Aiming SN is difficult to
identify on typical behavioral screening. Unlike other SN subtypes, however, Aiming SN is
strongly associated with specific neuroanatomic features: frontal lobe disconnection. In this
study, supported by experts in studying white matter disruption in SN (Carter), white matter
disruption as a predictor of stroke rehabilitation outcomes (Cramer), and novel brain imaging
(Qiu), the PI will develop a new process of SN diagnosis based on brain imaging biomarkers.
The team will develop brain imaging biomarkers associated with Aiming SN, using 4 advanced
imaging procedures, and demonstrate that these biomarkers can predict daily life function
improvement at 3 months and 6 months post-stroke (Aim 1). The experts supporting the PI have
experience with rapidly translating biomarker analyses to clinical imaging data, and thus the
SPiRE will also include a direct comparison of advanced imaging (high-resolution and diffusivity)
versus clinically-acquired data (Aim 2). The team will directly compare the biomarkers derived
from research imaging, with those derived from clinical imaging, to identify Aiming SN. They will
also test the relative ability of research versus clinical biomarkers to predict functional
independence at 3 and 6 months. At the next research step, armed with a potential biomarker
for Aiming SN and for functional gains with SN rehabilitation, our team will propose a larger,
multi-site study for biomarker validation. Our long-term goal is to lead SN research toward
routinely identifying affected veterans, and rapidly providing personalized cognitive
rehabilitation, to improve functional outcomes for veterans with stroke in the community."
