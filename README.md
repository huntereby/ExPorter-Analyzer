# ExPorter-Analyzer

This repository contains a simple R Shiny application that scans grant abstracts
stored in the `split_files` folder and displays the most common terms found in
those texts. The app automatically reads all `reporter_split_*.csv` files and
extracts word frequencies from the `ABSTRACT_TEXT` column.

## Running the application

1. Install the required packages:

```r
install.packages(c("shiny", "dplyr", "tidytext", "stringr", "ggplot2", "readr"))
```

2. Launch the app from R:

```r
shiny::runApp("app.R")
```

When the app starts it automatically loads the CSV files, computes the top
TFâ€‘IDF bigrams for each Administering IC and caches the results. Use the
dropdown menu to select an IC and view a bar plot of its top methods.
